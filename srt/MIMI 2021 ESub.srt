1
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,947
Hello?

2
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:19,779
Hello?

3
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,099
Mr. John?

4
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:22,419
How do you do, sir?

5
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,139
Hello?
I am good, but who's this?

6
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:26,339
Dubey.

7
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,139
Manoj Dubey, sir.
Remember?

8
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:30,459
I show you girls in UP?

9
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:34,579
You eat Chole-Kulcha, very spicy, sir?

10
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,979
Oh yeah.

11
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:38,139
Yes, of course.
Mr. Dubey, how are you?

12
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,059
Fantastic, sir.

13
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,179
So... you still in Delhi?

14
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,739
No, we left actually.

15
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,419
We're going to Rajasthan.

16
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,059
Okay.
Great, great.

17
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:50,299
Rajasthan is very beautiful.

18
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:52,579
Good news for you, sir.

19
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:56,579
We have some beautiful
young girls here for you.

20
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,939
That's nice, Mr. Dubey.

21
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,139
But we actually don't want your girls.

22
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,979
- Sorry.
- But sir, we got new stock here.

23
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:06,539
Just like you wanted.

24
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:09,579
I'm whatsapping you their pics.

25
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:11,299
You'll definitely like, sir.

26
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,339
Just see the pics and call me back.

27
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,539
Mr. Dubey, I've discussed it with my wife.

28
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,099
And we're gonna find our own surrogate.

29
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:19,419
Thank you, Mr. Dubey.

30
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:20,819
Sir...!

31
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,419
Is that the Surrogacy Clinic guy?

32
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:27,419
Yeah.

33
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,619
He has new girls for us.

34
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,619
Those girls are physically weak, John.

35
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,419
You've seen that place?

36
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,299
It's like a factory out there.

37
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:39,619
I know.

38
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,219
I told him,
but obviously he wants to make money.

39
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,259
Well, money is not the problem.

40
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:47,179
We need a young and healthy girl.

41
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,819
I know, honey.
I know.

42
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:51,219
We'll find her.

43
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,099
Sir?

44
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,579
Sorry?

45
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,539
Girl?
You want girl?

46
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,499
I want a girl?

47
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,299
Oh.

48
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,099
You know, you and madam... very forward.

49
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,539
We cannot handle one
woman and he wants two.

50
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:27,539
What, John?

51
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:29,659
Are you telling him
that you want another woman?

52
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,179
No, no.

53
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,139
Bhanu, when did I say that?

54
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,379
In car you both (were) talking...

55
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,659
Healthy and fit girl?

56
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,419
Oh my God, no!
Bhanu, listen,

57
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,979
we want a girl, but not for John.

58
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,339
You are quite fluent in Hindi.

59
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,779
I spent six years in Delhi.

60
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,339
I attended Hindi classes there.

61
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,419
Wonderful.

62
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:51,979
Then who do you need a girl for?

63
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,419
We need a ma for our child.

64
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:00,779
Ma?

65
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:02,619
You mean a Dayima?

66
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,099
What's a Dayima?

67
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,779
Dayima is someone who looks
after your child when you go out.

68
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:09,939
No, no, no.

69
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,169
We want a girl who looks
after our child, inside.

70
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,339
Inside?

71
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:19,419
What do you mean by inside?

72
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:22,699
In her womb.

73
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,139
Our child...

74
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,499
- Okay.
- In her womb.

75
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,619
We want a surrogate mother.

76
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:34,259
Because I can't conceive.

77
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,979
Your child in her womb?

78
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,419
Hmm?

79
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,979
I'll explain it to you, come on.

80
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,139
So that's how it works.

81
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,419
This is amazing.

82
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,979
We don't have kids either.
Been married 12 years.

83
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,619
I'll ask if she would
like to give this a try.

84
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,819
It's not cheap, costs millions.

85
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,418
Oh God.

86
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,059
It's not our cup of tea then.

87
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:04,219
We poor people take a loan
to educate our children,

88
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,419
not to have them.

89
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:07,819
What's he saying?

90
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:12,339
He's saying that he's been trying
to have a baby for a long time too.

91
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,219
And that he would never
be able to afford a surrogate.

92
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,419
No worries, ma'am.

93
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,539
I'll work hard
and have one naturally.

94
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:23,979
Bhanu?

95
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,779
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to hear that.

96
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,539
So you understand
what we're going through.

97
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,859
- Yes.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,299
So could you help us find a surrogate?

99
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,059
You are family, sir.
Why not?

100
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,659
But I am a poor guy...

101
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,099
Money?

102
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,539
Of course, we'll pay you.

103
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:42,579
How much?

104
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:44,699
Five.

105
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,371
That's too less, sir.

106
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,659
You know how expensive cooking gas is?

107
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,099
- At least make it ten.
- Ten?

108
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:52,979
That's a lot.

109
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,499
We can't afford that much.

110
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:59,059
We can only afford to give 500,000.

111
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:02,139
Bhanu?

112
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:03,219
Huh?

113
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,739
Five...

114
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,259
500,000.

115
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,139
For that kind of money,
even I'd agree to carry your baby.

116
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:13,099
Done, sir.

117
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,579
Deal.

118
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:15,699
Deal.

119
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:17,939
Rajendra?

120
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,059
Go call her.

121
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,739
Move it.

122
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,059
Amma, come on out.

123
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,419
Shanu Amma.

124
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,259
She has had 14 kids.

125
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,019
Two pairs of twins.

126
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,499
She is quite experienced.

127
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:38,819
Best surrogate.

128
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,099
- Bhanu!
- Hmm?

129
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,819
She won't work.

130
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:45,819
Why not?

131
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,099
She is quite talented.

132
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:50,419
Back in the day,
she'd climb a tree in no time.

133
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:52,059
Amma, can you still climb a tree?

134
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:52,779
Yes.

135
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,819
Go and climb one for us.

136
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,659
No, no, no, no, no.
Please stop.

137
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,259
- Stop.
- What is happening?

138
00:06:58,539 --> 00:06:59,579
Bhanu,

139
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:02,499
she cannot be our surrogate.

140
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,219
We want a young girl.

141
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,179
Young.

142
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:07,299
Not this old.

143
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:11,939
Bhanu... the surrogate doesn't decide
the look of the baby,

144
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:13,419
it decides the health.

145
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,659
Can you explain this to him?

146
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:20,419
We have to be safe.

147
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,499
One of our friends
picked a surrogate here,

148
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,499
but she was very weak.

149
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:29,819
So unfortunately,
the baby didn't survive.

150
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,819
I get it.

151
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,419
Amma, go inside.

152
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:38,419
I'll get you the best merch.

153
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,419
Merch?

154
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:43,259
Merch?

155
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,419
Ma.

156
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,739
I said Ma.

157
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:48,539
Please come with me, sir.

158
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,419
Let's go, sir.

159
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:55,139
"Hey Bikaneri chick, you are so slick."

160
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,539
"Lost my house because of you,"

161
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:59,219
"And now I'm about to lose my job too."

162
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:19,019
"Hey Romeos!"

163
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,979
"Roadside Romeos!"

164
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,619
"Innocent looking deceptive..."

165
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,019
"liars!"

166
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:29,019
[Background vocal]

167
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,619
"Hey Romeos, worthless boyos!"

168
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:40,579
"Stop bothering me,
you good for nothing fellows."

169
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,539
"You have already stolen our hearts,"

170
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,339
"Don't leave us behind."

171
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:48,259
"This isn't right, my love."

172
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,339
"You sometimes look like Mona Lisa."

173
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,139
"And sometimes like a mesmerising Lolita."

174
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:52,539
"Oh."

175
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,419
"And sometimes like a mystery."

176
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:59,339
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

177
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:03,339
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

178
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,219
"From head to toe, an absolute beauty."

179
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:11,619
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

180
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:19,579
"Hey supreme beauty..."

181
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,539
[Background vocal]

182
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:27,219
[Background vocal]

183
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:35,099
"I can't be tied down."

184
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:39,059
"I am like the wild wind."

185
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,859
"I have a long way ahead of me."

186
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,779
"I am not interested in gems or jewels,"

187
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,739
"I am interested in chasing my dreams."

188
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,059
"I am used to my dreams coming true."

189
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,579
"I don't want men chasing me."

190
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,219
"I am made for the big screen."

191
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,179
"You have already stolen our hearts,"

192
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,059
"Don't leave us behind."

193
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,699
"This isn't right, my love."

194
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,659
"You sometimes look like Mona Lisa."

195
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:09,219
"Buzz off."

196
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:10,859
"And sometimes like a mesmerising Lolita."

197
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,059
"And sometimes like a mystery."

198
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:18,019
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

199
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,819
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

200
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:25,739
"From head to toe, an absolute beauty."

201
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,019
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

202
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:34,099
"Don't touch me."

203
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,179
"I don't want be yours."

204
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:42,219
"I don't care even
if you beg for my company."

205
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,739
"No, no, no..."

206
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:49,779
"No, no, no..."

207
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:53,859
"Hey Bikaneri chick, you are so slick."

208
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,499
"Lost my house because of you,"

209
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:58,139
"And now I'm about to lose my job too."

210
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,139
"Looking at your curves,"

211
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:02,139
"My heart starts to race."

212
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:05,979
"Like the hands of a clock
going hickory, dickory, dockery."

213
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,659
"No, no, no..."

214
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,419
Owner's car...

215
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,219
driver's sweat...

216
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,219
makes the journey heartfelt.

217
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,459
Cheers.

218
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:20,619
Cheers.

219
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,659
Hey, Jolly Bro!

220
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:24,659
How are you?

221
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:26,499
When are you coming here?

222
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,619
It will take some time, Bro.

223
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:31,859
How much time are we talking about, huh?

224
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,579
Thousands of girls folk to
Mumbai every day to become a star.

225
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,539
The more you delay the
slimmer your chances get.

226
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,979
I need to have enough dough to come there.

227
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:41,099
You need to hurry up, girl.

228
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,419
I had a word with Dabboo,

229
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,859
he takes 500,000 for a photo shoot.

230
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:44,819
Excluding costume and makeup.

231
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:45,859
500,000?

232
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,459
For a photo shoot?

233
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:49,659
Does he do with a camera made of gold?

234
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:53,259
He's the most sought after
photographer in Bollywood.

235
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:56,579
How about we first shoot
a music video instead then?

236
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:57,539
We'll make it go viral.

237
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,059
It won't cost you much.

238
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,699
Just about need a million, yeah?

239
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,339
I'll have a word with Bhushan.

240
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:02,779
Jolly?

241
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:03,859
You're at a shoot!

242
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,779
Who was that?

243
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,659
Hello?

244
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:10,419
Sounded like he was
speaking to Shah Rukh Khan.

245
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:11,859
- Really?
- Really.

246
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,059
What was Jolly saying?

247
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:14,419
How much I have managed.

248
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,579
How can I possibly achieve
my dream with this, Shama?

249
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,859
Just have patience.

250
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,179
Patience bears fruits.

251
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,139
I've been dieting
on patience for years now.

252
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,539
Bhanu.

253
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:30,739
Sir.

254
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,619
I was saying my evening prayers.

255
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:35,619
What is it?

256
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,779
Bhanu, we have something
we'd like to tell you.

257
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,339
Yes?

258
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,299
Honey..

259
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,619
We liked a girl.

260
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,779
We want someone like
her to be our surrogate.

261
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:49,619
Who is this girl?

262
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,579
Who? Who?

263
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,819
Well, she's beautiful,
she's tall and she's a dancer.

264
00:12:56,099 --> 00:13:00,139
Oh, the tall girl who
was dancing downstairs?

265
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,419
Why didn't I think of her?

266
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:05,179
If we could get someone like her...?

267
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,419
Why someone like her?
We can get her.

268
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:08,819
Really?

269
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:10,579
Is that possible?

270
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,859
Yes, of course.

271
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,219
You are family.

272
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,539
Keep the money ready.

273
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,579
- Money can buy everything.
- What is happening?

274
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,739
- He's saying that he thinks may be able to get--
- Sir?

275
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:23,539
How much do you plan on paying her?

276
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:25,499
Money?

277
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,259
How many times do I have
to tell you to hurry up?

278
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:31,339
We won't find a ride home now.

279
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,779
We will.

280
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:33,819
Give me the money.

281
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,859
Here.

282
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,019
Let's go.

283
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:46,339
No, I can talk.

284
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:49,059
Bhanu Pratap, an art lover.

285
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,419
That was an amazing performance.

286
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:52,579
- My God!
- Thanks.

287
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:55,779
How are you guys going home?

288
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,419
By rickshaw?

289
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,499
If we get one.

290
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,419
You'll take a rickshaw?

291
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,179
Such a big star will travel in a rickshaw?

292
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,419
I cannot let that happen.

293
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,419
How will I face the society?

294
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:07,859
How will I face God?

295
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,019
Not possible.

296
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,179
Well, this is the only you have,
So there is no other option.

297
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,779
Your friend is so funny.

298
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,779
Come, let me drop you home in my taxi.

299
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,059
You own a taxi?

300
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,659
- Yes.
- How much will you charge us?

301
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,419
Come on,
how can I take money from you?

302
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,219
I am an art lover.

303
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,739
I am your fan.

304
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,259
A big fan.

305
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,619
- No thank you, we'll manage.
- No.

306
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,299
He's a fan.

307
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:32,539
We cannot refuse him.

308
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,139
Give me the rickshaw fare.

309
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:35,539
- Let's go.
- Yes, you shouldn't break your fan's heart.

310
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,219
- Let me carry your bag.
- No, I can manage.

311
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:39,499
My taxi's parked right outside.

312
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,579
You gave a mind-blowing performance.

313
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,179
"I learnt to walk holding your hand."

314
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:54,059
"I thrived under your care."

315
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,859
"Mother!"

316
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,219
"Oh my mother..."

317
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,459
Mother! Oh my mother!

318
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,819
A mother God's best gift to mankind.

319
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:04,259
Don't you think?

320
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:06,219
Right.

321
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,979
A mother-child relationship,

322
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,739
is the most pious
one in the world.

323
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:15,259
Looks like you love your mother a lot.

324
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,539
A lot.

325
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,299
- What's her name?
- Kainkayi.

326
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,979
You don't say!
And you still love her?

327
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,539
Love her?

328
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:27,139
I owe my life to her.

329
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,499
She nurtured me in
her womb for nine months.

330
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,139
Being a mother
is the greatest gift on earth.

331
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,859
If I could,
I would carry a child myself.

332
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,539
And where would
the baby come out from?

333
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:39,619
The rare end?

334
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,219
That's the problem with men.

335
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,979
We cannot give birth.

336
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,099
What should I do?

337
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:52,539
Take a right and drop me home.

338
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,939
Then do whatever you please.

339
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,259
You can pull up here.

340
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,019
Bye.

341
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:09,099
You have the dagger, right?

342
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,699
- Hmm?
- You have the dagger, right?

343
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,779
Yes, I do. I have the dagger.

344
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,179
Call once you reach home.

345
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:17,059
I'll call you.

346
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,979
- Good night.
- Good night.

347
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,459
Step on it.

348
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:24,659
Drive!

349
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,259
Pull up here.

350
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,099
- Here?
- Yes.

351
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:41,419
Excuse me?

352
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,139
What's wrong?
Did I forget something?

353
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:45,299
No, you didn't.

354
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,419
Well--

355
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:59,179
Well, like I said, being a
mother is the greatest gift on earth.

356
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,419
So what does that have to do with me?

357
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,579
I hope your dagger isn't too sharp.

358
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,819
Should I chop something off?

359
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:09,739
Something?

360
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:11,659
Anything you want.

361
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,259
No, thank you.

362
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,059
What were you saying?

363
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,139
Come on, tell me.

364
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,499
What is it?

365
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,659
Well...

366
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:30,339
You have something that men don't.

367
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,299
A womb.
The place where babies grow.

368
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,099
Are you drunk?

369
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,059
No.

370
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,419
I did have just a bit.

371
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:42,659
- Bloody drunkard.
- Please hear me out.

372
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,979
The American couple
staying at the Amar Mahal?

373
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,979
Did you see them?

374
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,019
No.

375
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:54,219
I'll introduce you to them tomorrow.

376
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,739
They... like you.

377
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,419
They want you to have their baby.

378
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:06,419
Because you are a dancer.

379
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:07,619
You have a great body.

380
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:09,579
God has blessed you with great features.

381
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,299
Who was that?

382
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,419
No one!

383
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:22,299
"Oh my beloved..."

384
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:27,219
"Oh my beloved..."

385
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,499
Saw the number of
likes on my FB, hmm?

386
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,419
855 likes.

387
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,819
I am sure it'll reach 1000 by tomorrow.

388
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,619
Just read the comments.

389
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:51,459
"Hot!"

390
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,659
"Set fire to the rain!"

391
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,139
I have quite a fan following out here.

392
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,259
Call me to Bombay already, my Romeo!

393
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:05,419
Hot!

394
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:14,419
Let me go you bandit!

395
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,739
You're crazy!

396
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:23,499
My bad luck is your good luck, girls.

397
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,859
You will be out of jobs once I get there.

398
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,539
No one will even think about you.

399
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:35,139
All the heroes will
chase me screaming Mimi-Mimi.

400
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:37,219
I am coming!

401
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:41,819
Wrong scale, Dad.

402
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,139
You should pick a higher scale.

403
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,859
Now you'll teach me about music, huh?

404
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,059
Isn't she a part of your lineage, uncle?

405
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:50,139
Hello!

406
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:52,299
I have my own identity.

407
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,259
I have done 72 shows.

408
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,139
How many, kids?

409
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,419
72.

410
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,859
Right.

411
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,619
Her videos are on FB, you know?

412
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:02,139
Sis, what's the name
of the magazine that you read?

413
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:03,179
Cosmopolitan.

414
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,979
You wouldn't read this nonsense
if you would have finished college.

415
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:08,859
Mind your own business, Mom.

416
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:10,419
I know what I want from life.

417
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,859
Why don't you enlighten me?
What do you want from life?

418
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:19,299
Mr. Jadawat's daughter
got married at the age of 21.

419
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:20,499
And this one.

420
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,859
There! That's where they go wrong, Aatif.

421
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:24,499
They just don't get it.

422
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,339
PC wouldn't be a star
if her parents hadn't encouraged her.

423
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:29,419
PC?

424
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:30,979
Priyanka Chopra, Uncle.

425
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,739
Went from Bareilly to Bollywood
and became a star.

426
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,939
But her father was a doctor
in the army,

427
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:37,299
not some ordinary Joe.

428
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,019
Come here.

429
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,419
Who did you call an ordinary Joe, huh?

430
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,659
You.

431
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:48,659
Tell me something,
how do you know all this?

432
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:50,419
Social network, Uncle.

433
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,419
I am telling you!!!

434
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,819
You should open
an account with Facebook.

435
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,379
It only costs 200 bucks.

436
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:56,299
Think again.

437
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,059
Facebook?

438
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,659
I think you've dropped your money.

439
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:03,979
Someone stole your sandals.

440
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:05,779
Excuse me.

441
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,459
Excuse me, please.
Auntie, your veil's sweeping the floor.

442
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:11,059
Yours' too.

443
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:12,419
I'm coming, I'm coming.

444
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:13,979
Priest!

445
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,499
I hope you are putting
in a good word for me.

446
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,259
I come twice a week these days.

447
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:20,019
I had a word with God.

448
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,419
Asked Him to bless you
with a handsome husband,

449
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:24,179
and a beautiful child.

450
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:25,499
You don't say!

451
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:28,059
No wonder it is taking so long!
That's not what I want.

452
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,379
I want to go to Bollywood.

453
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:30,459
Where's that?

454
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,419
A wrong priest can mess up your plans.

455
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:35,979
You should reconsider, auntie.

456
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:42,339
[Prayers]

457
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:50,339
Hey!

458
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:51,539
Put it on my tab.

459
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,539
Give me the plate.

460
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:53,779
Put that on my tab as well.

461
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:56,419
Does she come here every day?

462
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:03,339
Mimi ji?

463
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,419
Mimi ji?

464
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,019
Can I have a minute, Mimi ji?

465
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,579
What is it?
Why are you following me?

466
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,499
Do you want another slap?
Or my sandal?

467
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,339
Please hear me out.

468
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,419
Then beat me or slap me.

469
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,979
Look, I'm offering you my other cheek.

470
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,419
Please, just hear me out.

471
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,179
Fine, out with it.

472
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:37,139
You slapped me for no reason.

473
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:38,299
For no reason?

474
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,339
You asked me to sleep
with that foreigner.

475
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,059
You should thank God
I only slapped you.

476
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:45,139
Where I am from,
we usually smash faces.

477
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,539
For no reason he says!

478
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,339
You misunderstand.

479
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,819
You don't have to sleep
with John to have his baby.

480
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:55,299
He won't even touch you.
No physical contact.

481
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,619
Are you drunk again?

482
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,619
Mimi ji, this is a new method.

483
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,299
It's called surrogacy.

484
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,419
What? Legacy?

485
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,539
Not legacy.

486
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,219
Let me explain.

487
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:12,339
Do you own a farm?

488
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:14,539
My uncle has one in Dholpur.
How does that matter?

489
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,179
What does he grow?

490
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,179
Sugarcane.

491
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:18,339
Okay.
Perfect.

492
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,459
So basically John and Summer want
to grow their sugarcane in your farm.

493
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:24,659
Do they want a sugarcane
or a baby?

494
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,139
Sugarcane = baby.

495
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:29,219
Carry on.

496
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,179
Summer's land is barren.

497
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,179
She will take your farm on rent.

498
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,819
John will plant the seed.

499
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,619
Summer will provide
the necessary manure.

500
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:41,299
You will hand over the sugarcane
to them as soon as it is ready,

501
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,539
and they'll pay you rent
for using your farm.

502
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,019
Your womb.. Their child...

503
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:52,739
So I won't have to sleep with anyone?

504
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:53,779
No.

505
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,779
- And I'll give birth to a baby?
- Yes.

506
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:57,299
You don't say!

507
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,339
Science has surely made
a lot of progress.

508
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,659
Is that really happening? For real?

509
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:02,739
Yes.

510
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,339
A lot of people do it.

511
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,579
That's what I have been
trying to explain to you.

512
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,419
Right.

513
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:14,179
So I need to carry their
baby in my womb for nine months.

514
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,219
You got it.

515
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:17,859
Have you lost your freaking mind?

516
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:19,659
Why on earth would I do that?

517
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,379
I want to be a movie star
and he wants me to become a mother.

518
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:23,619
There are so many women
in this country,

519
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:24,659
go find someone else.

520
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:25,979
Crazy man.

521
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:28,219
Zip it!

522
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,179
No crying!

523
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:31,059
Get him to shut up.

524
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:32,979
Crazy woman.

525
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,819
Mimi ji, you'll get 2 million for it.

526
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:40,139
2 million.

527
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,419
You want to go to Bollywood, right?

528
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:49,299
Isn't that what you prayed for?

529
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,019
It's a sign from God.

530
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,259
2 million.

531
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:53,139
Mom, does it hurt a lot,
while giving birth?

532
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,699
It hurts more
when your child strays away.

533
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:51,339
'Mimi ji, you'll get 2 million for it.'

534
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,619
'You want to go to Bollywood, right?'

535
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,419
'Isn't that what you prayed for?'

536
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,099
'It's a sign from God.'

537
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:01,699
'2 million.'

538
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:06,619
Stop bullshitting me.

539
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:08,699
This is what that guy said.

540
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,059
He's a nutcase.

541
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:11,979
Don't pay any heed to him.

542
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,419
It is quite common these days.

543
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:21,699
Girls are making millions
by renting out their wombs.

544
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,779
We cannot eat shit just
because someone else is.

545
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:30,219
Because we have a grand feast
laid out for us, right?

546
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:32,899
Don't just look at the
money that's being offered.

547
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:34,259
Give some thought to
what you have to do.

548
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,459
What should I do?

549
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:37,379
Jolly called,

550
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:38,699
asking when I'm coming to Bombay.

551
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:39,779
What should I tell him?

552
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,779
You know PC, Bebo, Kangana...

553
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,219
They were also surrogates?

554
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,059
No, they became actresses
at a very young age.

555
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:51,739
And I am already 25!

556
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,139
Any longer and I'll have
to play a mother instead.

557
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:56,379
I need to become a mother now,

558
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,219
to avoid to playing one on screen.

559
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,379
Think about it, Shama.

560
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,059
It's a lot of money.

561
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:04,339
Hard cash.

562
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:05,579
Give it another thought.

563
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:10,779
I am tired of dancing for peanuts.

564
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,099
All I am asking you to do
is meet the couple.

565
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,259
If we don't like it, we'll refuse.

566
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:29,339
Good Lord, he is so handsome.

567
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:32,339
I wouldn't mind sleeping
with him to have his baby.

568
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,339
Yes, he is hot.

569
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:36,539
Look at his eyes!

570
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:41,539
He is hot, but he won't sleep
with you, he's my husband.

571
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,619
What the hell!

572
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,379
Hindi... you speak?

573
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,619
I forgot to mention,
she speaks quite well.

574
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,139
She also knows the Gayatri
Mantra and Hanuman Chalisa.

575
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:53,259
Stop exaggerating.

576
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,659
I am not that good at it.

577
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:56,499
Good.

578
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:04,099
So tell me, the woman who gives
birth to your baby gets 2 million?

579
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:05,459
Yes.

580
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:06,579
Yes.

581
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,539
And we like you.

582
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,219
Why her?

583
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,579
Why not someone else?

584
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,259
Why do you want it to be her?

585
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,339
Because she is super fit.

586
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:17,459
She is healthy.

587
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:18,779
And she's a dancer.

588
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,179
Athletes and dancers,
they have the best bodies.

589
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:27,419
Such ladies give birth
to healthy children.

590
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:29,339
Best body.

591
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:30,499
That's why.

592
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:33,979
Mimi ji, if you have
any questions for them,

593
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:35,858
about the baby, about the method,

594
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:36,779
then please go ahead.

595
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:37,819
Right.

596
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:40,499
In how many instalments
do I get my 2 million?

597
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:45,499
So, we've decided we'll give 50,000
every month for the first nine months.

598
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:50,619
And the rest - 1,550,000,
after the delivery.

599
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:53,419
1,550,000 in one shot, hard cash?

600
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:58,059
You betcha! Crisp bank notes!

601
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,819
You two can sleep on a bed of money.

602
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:03,259
One more thing.

603
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,539
If I have twins,
do I get paid double?

604
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:07,659
- No.
- No.

605
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,699
Why "no"?

606
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,499
No, you won't.

607
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,539
Double babies, double pain.

608
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,859
And if I have triplets like Farah Khan?

609
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:16,819
Then tripple?

610
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:17,979
What's she saying?

611
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,819
- Well, she's saying--
- She's saying two babies, money double.

612
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:24,139
Three babies, money triple.

613
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:25,579
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

614
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:26,779
Whoa!

615
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,979
Mimi listen, if that happens
of course we'll pay you more.

616
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,259
But please, I'm begging you,
don't give us more than two.

617
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:36,779
We can't afford it.

618
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,699
Come on now,
as if thats in my hands.

619
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:41,819
One more thing.

620
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:45,419
We will have to take you
to a clinic in Jaipur for a check-up.

621
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:50,579
So, it'll be great if you can
let us know your decision quickly?

622
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:55,099
If you aren't ready to do this
then we'll have to find another girl.

623
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:57,259
We'll be paying her then.

624
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,139
Aah.

625
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:09,059
"Neither wife,
nor kids, nor parents, nothing matters."

626
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:14,019
"The whole thing is that...
money rules over everything."

627
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:21,019
All things said and done,
what will I tell my family about the baby?

628
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:22,779
I'll start showing in a couple of months.

629
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:24,659
I can't say that I have gained weight.

630
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:25,979
They won't buy it.

631
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,739
You don't need to tell them anything.

632
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,179
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

633
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:32,419
I mean many surrogate
mothers stay away from home.

634
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:34,579
Many don't tell their parents.

635
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:36,499
You too could stay away from home.

636
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:38,339
Now don't ask me to find you a place.

637
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:39,339
Find your own place.

638
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,419
Where can I go?

639
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:47,619
Well, you can stay with me.

640
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,619
I stay quite far away from your place.

641
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:52,419
You don't have a family?

642
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:54,139
It's just me and my dad.

643
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,339
My dad is hardly home.

644
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:58,499
I don't get to see
him for months myself.

645
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,099
Why?

646
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,419
He's a Maulvi

647
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:04,259
He barely steps out of a mosque.

648
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:05,699
And I cannot step inside it.

649
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,859
It's the best solution... for you.

650
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:10,619
Think about it.

651
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:18,419
It's the best solution.

652
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:20,099
"Money rules over everything."

653
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:26,579
The technique of IVF,
removes several fertile eggs

654
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:29,819
From the ovaries,
for fertilization in the laboratory

655
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:34,339
Doctor, this is the
girl we were talking about.

656
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:36,859
So you are Mimi?

657
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,579
You don't say!

658
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:39,859
Aren't you on FB?

659
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,819
Have you willingly agreed to do this?

660
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:45,979
No one can dare force me.

661
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:53,619
Mimi ji, you'll have to keep a few things
in mind after you get pregnant.

662
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:56,059
You'll have to eat healthy.

663
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:57,659
You'll have to go on walks.

664
00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:00,219
You'll have to stay happy and exercise--

665
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:02,419
Yes, yes.
Don't worry.

666
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:09,139
I'll carry the baby to term, hand
it over to them and collect my payment.

667
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:10,579
Money?

668
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:13,339
Do you have any doubts?

669
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:16,419
No.

670
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:20,099
Will I get stretch marks?

671
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,779
I mean, I hope it won't ruin my figure.

672
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:23,739
No.

673
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,499
- Have you gone through this?
- No.

674
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,259
So?

675
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,619
Has it ruined Shilpa Shetty's figure?

676
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,139
You don't say!

677
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:34,659
She is right.

678
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:35,659
Best body.

679
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:40,819
Mr. John, to start with
we will need your sperms.

680
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,579
Needhi will guide you
to the sperm deposit room.

681
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:45,859
Okay.

682
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,419
Sir?

683
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,419
If you need any help, call me?

684
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,619
That's kind of you, Bhanu.

685
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,459
I've done this before.

686
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:11,099
So Mrs. Summer, when was your last period?

687
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:31,059
"This is the best news of my life."

688
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:39,699
"It has made my heart rejoice."

689
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:44,179
"This means..."

690
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:48,339
"A guest is going to come."

691
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,259
"This means..."

692
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:56,859
"Its time to celebrate."

693
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,059
- "This means..."
- I am going to be the mother of your child!

694
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:04,859
"A guest is going to come."

695
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,579
"This means..."

696
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:13,419
"I have hit a jackpot."

697
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:26,379
"It's time to bid farewell
to regrets and welcome good luck."

698
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,419
"God has been generous."

699
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:34,099
"My prayers have been answered."

700
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:36,259
"Everything seems fragrant."

701
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:38,339
"Everywhere there are celebrations."

702
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:43,499
"My happiness knows no bounds."

703
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:04,779
Congratulations.

704
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:06,219
Huh?

705
00:36:07,419 --> 00:36:09,259
The pregnancy strip was right.

706
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:11,059
She's pregnant.

707
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,579
Congratulations.

708
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:21,339
Oh, my God!

709
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,059
Oh, my God!

710
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:27,099
I love you.

711
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:29,979
Congratulations.

712
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:31,099
Congratulations.

713
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:33,099
We're gonna be a mom and dad.

714
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:34,739
I love you so much.

715
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:36,539
Oh!

716
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:45,699
Mimi, thank you.

717
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,861
You've changed our lives.

718
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,419
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.

719
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:53,419
No, not welcome.

720
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,579
Bhanu, you too, thank you so much.

721
00:36:58,659 --> 00:36:59,339
- 2 million!
- No problem, sir.

722
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:01,339
Cash okay, cheque okay, no tax.

723
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,499
Yes, yes, of course.
Of course, don't worry about it.

724
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:04,579
Don't worry.

725
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,099
We did it.

726
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,579
Doctor, thank you.

727
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:12,619
Most welcome.

728
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,459
I'll see you soon?

729
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,819
We are so happy, Mimi.

730
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,019
Then how about making me happy as well?

731
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:25,619
- Yes!
- Oh!

732
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:27,499
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

733
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,539
Mimi, this is for you.

734
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,499
- No.
- Hey!

735
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,059
- For her.
- Yeah.

736
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:39,219
This is for you.

737
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:40,539
Thank you.

738
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,739
And this is for the next four months.

739
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,419
We'll pay you the rest after we come back.

740
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:50,139
- Come back?
- Where are you going?

741
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:52,579
We are going back to America.

742
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:56,259
We need to get back to work
since we're becoming parents.

743
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:57,859
Need the money, right?

744
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:59,219
Need the money.

745
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,339
Don't worry.

746
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,379
I'm around to make
sure you don't face any problems.

747
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,179
We are fine even if you don't!

748
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:05,339
We can manage on our own.

749
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:06,499
- We don't need him.
- No, no, no.

750
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:07,979
Bhanu is here to take care of you.

751
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,019
I'll always stay in touch with Bhanu.

752
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,419
So please, let him stay.

753
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,539
It's their flower
nurturing in your garden.

754
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:17,259
Let me do the job of the gardener, okay?

755
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,579
Take care. Sister.

756
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:20,739
Okay?

757
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:21,979
Come here.

758
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:24,739
What will you tell your parents?

759
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:26,539
We should go or we are
not going to make the flight.

760
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:27,619
- Okay?
- No problem, ma'am.

761
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:29,259
John sir, Summer ma'am, come.

762
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,019
A movie shoot?

763
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:35,619
For nine months?

764
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:37,179
For that long?

765
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:38,858
Seems like a very big movie.

766
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,459
It is, Mom.

767
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,499
It's four hours long.

768
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:42,499
Four hours?

769
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:43,819
What's the name of the movie?

770
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,099
- The name?
- Yes.

771
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:47,499
"Love in the middle of the sea."

772
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,099
In the middle of the sea, huh?

773
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:50,339
Right.

774
00:38:50,419 --> 00:38:51,699
What will they do
in the middle of the sea?

775
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:53,019
Love.

776
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,459
- Love.
- I see.

777
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:56,219
Let me explain.

778
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,659
- We will be shooting on a big ship.
- Okay.

779
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,819
The ship will stay in the sea
for nine months while we keep filming.

780
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:04,459
Haven't they already made a similar movie,

781
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,499
where the ship sinks and everyone
dies in the end?

782
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:08,139
Huh?

783
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:09,339
No, no, no.

784
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:10,379
No one is dying in this movie.

785
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:11,659
No one is dying in this movie, Dad.

786
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:15,859
As soon as the ship docks,
the parents give them their blessings,

787
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:17,139
and the girl and the boy get married.

788
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,539
The end, happy ending.

789
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,259
Very good.

790
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,499
- Isn't it?
- It's a good story, isn't it?

791
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:23,139
No?

792
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:25,019
No.

793
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:27,459
You cannot go.

794
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,379
Why not?

795
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:30,419
No.

796
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:33,419
You don't need to do this.

797
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:37,979
Boys from decent families don't
like girls who work in the movies.

798
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,499
Mom, once I become a star,

799
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:42,459
Then I will pick and choose
the guy I want to marry.

800
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,259
- Is it?
- Of course.

801
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:46,659
And look at this!

802
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:49,459
They have already given me an advance.

803
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,059
They are going pay me handsomely.

804
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:53,499
Think about it.

805
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:55,459
I'll be a movie star.

806
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:58,539
Huge posters of me everywhere.

807
00:39:58,619 --> 00:39:59,819
I'll be on TV.

808
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:01,139
I'll do interviews.

809
00:40:01,657 --> 00:40:03,099
Mine?

810
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:06,059
Of course,
they will interview you as well.

811
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:08,179
You'll be on TV as well.

812
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:17,979
Then I'll tell everyone how
great our art and our lineage is.

813
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:18,819
Yes, you should.

814
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:19,779
- Right?
- Right.

815
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:20,619
No.

816
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:21,739
Sit down.

817
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,459
Okay.
Sit down.

818
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:25,979
Mom!

819
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,419
Come on, just think about it.

820
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,139
We will renovate
our house every year.

821
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,019
Every year!

822
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:34,059
You'll be surrounded by servants.

823
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:38,139
Who will be forever at your command

824
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,019
Please let me do this.

825
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,739
Please let me go.

826
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,459
Don't ask me.

827
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:47,539
You and your father can do as you please.

828
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:50,219
Fine.

829
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:54,179
But only under one condition.

830
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,419
What condition?

831
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,339
You'll use your full name.

832
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:01,339
Mimi Maansingh Rathore.

833
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,019
Of course, I will!

834
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,539
Shama!

835
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:30,579
Salaam Alaikum. [Greetings]

836
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:32,339
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

837
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,299
Where are your guests from?

838
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,819
You know my aunt in Kalyan?

839
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:41,259
Your aunt in Kalyan?

840
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,059
The one who had grey
hair from a very young age?

841
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:48,859
Yes, I remember her.

842
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:53,579
The one who wears body
fitted dresses, right?

843
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:55,979
Right.

844
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,019
This is her niece.

845
00:41:58,979 --> 00:41:59,819
Chand.

846
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:01,539
Salaam. [Greetings]

847
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:02,579
What did you say her name was?

848
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:04,099
- Chand.
- Chand.

849
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:05,459
And this is her husband.

850
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:07,619
Naseeruddin.

851
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:08,459
Salaam Walaikum. [Greetings]

852
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:09,659
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

853
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:10,619
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

854
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:12,219
What do you do?

855
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:13,539
I'm a driver.

856
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,539
With God's grace, I own my own car.

857
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,219
<i>Praise Lord Ram</i>

858
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,419
A second-hand car.

859
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:24,459
I have a new project underway.

860
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:25,659
Ill buy a new car soon.

861
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:28,339
- See you around.
- Okay.

862
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:29,699
Let me know if you
have contacts at the bank.

863
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:30,819
Sure. Always happy to help.

864
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:33,059
We are family.
Family always helps each other.

865
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:38,339
[Prayers]

866
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:40,019
Hey!

867
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,659
Morning walk!

868
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:44,259
Get up!

869
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:45,019
Get up!

870
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:45,979
Come on guys!

871
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:54,059
Mimi... wakey-wakey.

872
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,379
Mimi, come on, wake up.

873
00:42:58,459 --> 00:42:59,899
You are supposed to go on morning walks.

874
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:00,739
Come on, get up.

875
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:02,739
Let's do the morning walk in the evening.

876
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:05,459
Morning walk is good for the baby.

877
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,499
You don't do it, let the baby do it.

878
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,699
- Get up.
- But the baby wants to sleep.

879
00:43:12,779 --> 00:43:13,699
Get up.

880
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,059
You look good.

881
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:22,219
Thanks.

882
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:24,859
Put this on.

883
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:28,539
Cover the whole face.

884
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:29,619
This okay?

885
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:30,659
Okay.

886
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:33,419
Salaam Alaikum, Shama. [Greetings]

887
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,059
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

888
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:36,739
Where are you off to
this early in the morning?

889
00:43:37,419 --> 00:43:38,579
Just for a morning walk?

890
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:40,819
Chand is used to it.

891
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:42,019
Oh.

892
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,339
You didn't tell me that
Mimi is working in a movie?

893
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:46,499
- In a movie, huh?
- Yeah.

894
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:48,979
Mimi's father was telling
everyone at the bus depot.

895
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,259
She went to Mumbai to work in the movies.

896
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:52,539
She'll be a movie star soon.

897
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,299
I am sure you are aware about this.

898
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:55,979
Yes, she had told me about it.

899
00:43:57,819 --> 00:43:58,739
Chand?

900
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,419
Let's go, Chand.

901
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:08,859
I have to say, Chand is quite tall.

902
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:11,379
She'll need 6 meters
of cloth at the least.

903
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:12,699
Right, anything less
won't suffice.

904
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:13,699
Hmm?

905
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:17,859
Who is it?

906
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:22,219
What...

907
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:24,419
Wait.

908
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,459
Fine, break the door.

909
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:31,179
Coming.

910
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:35,819
Who are you?

911
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:42,179
I am Shama's aunt's niece's husband.

912
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:43,699
But who are you?

913
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,299
- Who me?
- Yes.

914
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:46,579
Shama's father.

915
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,979
Oh that's wonderful,
I feel blessed with your presence.

916
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:52,419
It's so good to finally meet you.

917
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:54,699
Salaam walaikum. [Greetings]

918
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,139
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

919
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,219
Can I come in?

920
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:04,219
Sure.
Welcome to my house.

921
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:05,779
I mean welcome to your house.

922
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:08,539
I should quickly hide the alcohol.

923
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:17,179
What did you say your name was, mister?

924
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,259
- My name?
- Yes.

925
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:21,419
Nawazuddin.

926
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,539
- Nawazuddin?
- Yes.

927
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:27,419
So you are Zohra Begum's son-in-law?

928
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:29,179
Zohra?

929
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:31,619
No, I'm the son-in-law of the
aunt in Kalyan who wears tight dresses.

930
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,179
She is Zohra Begum.

931
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:34,539
Oh, her name is Zohra?

932
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:35,579
I didn't know.

933
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:37,259
I always addressed her as Mom.

934
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:38,579
Please forgive me, Mom.

935
00:45:39,179 --> 00:45:41,219
Where is Shama?

936
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:49,659
Candle?
Extinguished it.

937
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:51,019
Why would we need it during the day?

938
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,219
I am talking about my daughter Shama.

939
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:57,619
She has gone out with my daughter--
my wife for morning walk.

940
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:59,179
- Walk?
- Yes.

941
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,819
Walk means using your
legs to move forward.

942
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:03,419
Let me show you.

943
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:07,299
This is what you'd call a slow walk.

944
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:10,419
This is a fast walk.

945
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:13,099
Come here, mister.

946
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:17,419
Please come here.

947
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,419
I know what "walk" means.

948
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:29,179
What I meant was what made
Shama suddenly go on a walk?

949
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:33,099
My wife is used to going on morning walks.

950
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:34,419
Doctor has advised it too.

951
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,459
One should go on walks regularly.
It's good for the heart.

952
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:41,339
Do you read Namaaz [Prayers]?

953
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:43,859
Yes, of course I do.
I read it quite often. I love it.

954
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:45,179
How many times do you read it?

955
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:46,299
10 times.

956
00:46:46,419 --> 00:46:48,979
One reads Namaaz only
five times in day, mister.

957
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,779
I gave you a count for two days.

958
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:54,179
Did you read the Morning Namaaz
for the day?

959
00:46:57,419 --> 00:46:58,979
I'll read it after I have a bath.

960
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:02,339
It is read at five in the morning.

961
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,859
I'll read it tomorrow morning at five.

962
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:06,019
Oh good lord, this guy...!

963
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:08,379
I'm a heart patient.

964
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,379
Can I lie down for a bit?
My heart's palpitating.

965
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:12,459
Yes, of course.
You should rest.

966
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,619
Look at him, he's still sleeping.

967
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:30,059
- Shama.
- Dad!

968
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:33,059
Thank God you came.

969
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:35,699
When did they come?

970
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:39,059
You remember the aunty from Kalyan?
Who wears tight dresses?

971
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:42,339
Why does everyone keep telling
me about the way she dresses!

972
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:43,859
No?

973
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,019
I asked, when did they get here.

974
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,139
Yesterday.

975
00:47:48,459 --> 00:47:49,619
This is Chand.

976
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:50,659
Salaam. [Greetings]

977
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,379
Salaam. [Greetings]

978
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:52,419
She is pregnant.

979
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:53,259
Okay.

980
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:54,339
She was just a baby
when she had come here.

981
00:47:54,419 --> 00:47:55,419
Do you remember?

982
00:47:56,179 --> 00:48:00,099
You don't talk to anyone,
so you don't know anything.

983
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:05,299
Well, she was finding it difficult
at her house so I asked her to come here.

984
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:06,539
Dad, I did the right thing, didn't I?

985
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:08,539
Yes, you did the right thing.

986
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:11,699
This must be God's will.

987
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:14,339
- Right.
- Zohra Begum has done a lot for us.

988
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:19,659
You go have a bath,
then accompany me to the Mosque.

989
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:21,779
We'll read the Afternoon Namaaz there.

1033
00:51:48,779 --> 00:51:49,819
Want to see something fun?

That's our baby.

Okay, yeah.

00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:38,819
Good.

1053
00:52:38,899 --> 00:52:39,699
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1054
00:52:39,779 --> 00:52:41,219
I have put on some weight, haven't I?

Hey, Doctor.

1062
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:09,339
Hello.

1063
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:12,619
Please sit.

1064
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:13,699
Okay.

1065
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:25,859
We had some doubts
after the last check-up,

1066
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:28,819
so we did a battery
of tests on Mimi yesterday.

1067
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:30,979
What's wrong, Doctor?

1068
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:34,299
There is a problem with your child.

1069
00:53:38,859 --> 00:53:41,059
Your child is mentally challenged.

1070
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:45,819
Your child has down syndrome.

1071
00:53:47,179 --> 00:53:48,099
What?

1072
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,139
That's what the reports say.

1073
00:53:51,419 --> 00:53:53,659
I'm-- I'm really very sorry.

1074
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:58,699
I know it's very hard for you
to accept it, but it happens sometimes.

1075
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:03,059
No matter how much care you
take of yourself or your child,

1076
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:06,459
your child turns out to be disabled.

1077
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:09,579
Can't you fix it, Doctor?

1078
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:14,979
What any hospital can do is provide
you with medical care and a specialist--

1079

Summer, wait.

1080
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,339

00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:09,659
Bhanu, take us to Mimi.

1095
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,419
What?

1096
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:12,659
No, no, no, I can't.

1097
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:14,819
I can't face her, John.
Please no.

1098
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:16,179
No.

1099
00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:19,979
- I can't.
- What happen?

1100
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:20,779
What happen?

1101
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,979
Bhanu, pull over.

1102
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,419
No.

1103
00:55:24,979 --> 00:55:26,139
You don't want the baby?

1104
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:29,139
Have you lost it?

1105
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:30,299
You think this is a game?

1106
00:55:30,379 --> 00:55:31,299
Bhanu.

1107
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:37,059
We can't raise this child.

1108
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:42,419
You think money can
buy you everything, right?

1109
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:43,779
You think this is a poor country,

1110
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:45,819
just throw some cash and
we will do anything?

1111
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:46,739
No.

1112
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:50,579
Bhanu that is not how we think.

1113
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,579
We have been touring India for a year now.

1114
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:56,459
We have visited many surrogacy clinics.

1115
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:58,299
You know why?

1116
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:04,019
Because-- because we
wanted a perfect surrogate,

1117
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:06,819
so that we get a perfect
and a healthy baby.

1118
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:10,299
Not a disabled one.

1119
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:12,699
Not-- not a baby with down syndrome.

1120
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:16,419
What will we do with such a child, Bhanu?

1121
00:56:17,259 --> 00:56:19,099
And what will that
girl do with that child?

1122
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:21,219
It is your baby.

1123
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,779
You have to keep it, no matter how it is.

1124
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:27,299
My wife and I would've treasured
the child if it had been ours.

1125
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:29,179
Bhanu, please understand.

1126
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:31,059
We can't raise a disabled baby.

1127
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:32,219
We just can't.

1128
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:33,699
We can't.

1129
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:36,819
Don't ask us to keep this baby.

1130
00:56:40,419 --> 00:56:41,979
I request you.

1131
00:56:42,459 --> 00:56:47,779
Please tell Mimi...
to get rid of the baby.

1132
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:49,019
- I can't.
- Please don't say that.

1133
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:50,059
No.

1134
00:56:50,722 --> 00:56:52,059
- Summer ji?
- No.

1135
00:56:54,299 --> 00:56:55,299
John sir?

1136
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,179
Sir, I request you.

1137
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:01,299
I request you, please take your baby.

1138
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:03,179
Take your baby.

1139
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:07,579
This isn't what we wanted, Bhanu.

1140
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:28,019
I'll find you a place in Juhu,
that's where all the movie stars stay.

1141
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,179
Right.

1142
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:30,859
Find a nice house.

1143
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:32,099
It should be sea facing.

1144
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:33,179
- Sea facing?
- Yes.

1145
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:35,099
You know how expensive it will be?

1146
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:36,099
You don't say!

1147
00:57:36,259 --> 00:57:38,819
You don't need to worry about the money,
Jolly Brother.

1148
00:57:38,979 --> 00:57:40,819
Shama and I will be
there in a couple of months.

1149
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:45,539
Listen, let's make Shama
sing in our viral video, yeah?

1150
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:47,419
She is a great singer.

1151
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,179
You should have a word with Bhushan ji.

1152
00:57:49,259 --> 00:57:50,459
I'll talk to him and get back to you.

1153
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:51,339
Okay.

1154
00:57:51,419 --> 00:57:53,139
Don't forget to send
me pictures of the house.

1155
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:54,659
Right.
Okay, bye.

1156
00:57:56,179 --> 00:57:57,059
Bhanu!

1157
00:57:57,419 --> 00:57:59,099
You too should come to Mumbai with us.

1158
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:00,979
You can be my driver.

1159
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:02,619
We will have loads of fun, right?

1160
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:03,739
Right.

1161
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:05,699
What's wrong?

1162
00:58:06,299 --> 00:58:07,459
Why this sad face?

1163
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:09,419
What happened?

1164
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:17,419
Summer ji said that
she doesn't want the baby.

1165
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:19,739
What do you mean by
she doesn't want the baby?

1166
00:58:20,019 --> 00:58:21,099
Are you high or what?

1167
00:58:23,419 --> 00:58:29,059
Doctor's reports state that
there is a problem with the child.

1168
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:31,659
Problem?

1169
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:33,339
Problem?

1170
00:58:33,419 --> 00:58:34,739
What's the problem?

1171
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:37,059
What's the problem?

1172
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,339
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

1173
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:43,659
She has asked you to abort the child.

1174
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:46,699
Abort the child?

1175
00:58:47,299 --> 00:58:48,619
Have you lost it, Bhanu?

1176
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:50,259
Are you out of your mind?

1177
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:53,099
- Let me call Summer.
- How can she say that?

1178
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:55,419
She is carrying their child, Bhanu.

1179
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,419
I cannot get through.

1180
00:58:57,819 --> 00:58:58,659
They agreed to this.

1181
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:00,459
We did this for them.
How can she say that?

1182
00:59:00,979 --> 00:59:02,579
I cannot get through her phone!

1183
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:03,579
Where is Summer?

1184
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:05,259
I just dropped them to their hotel.

1185
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,579
Get out of my way.

1186
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:08,539
Mimi!

1187
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:48,619
Shama she will run away.

1188
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:54,699
Hurry up.

1189
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:01,259
Hurry up, Bhanu.

1190
01:00:24,339 --> 01:00:26,299
Where are John and Summer?

1191
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:28,139
They just checked out and left.

1192
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:29,819
They left?

1193
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:31,459
Where did they go?

1194
01:00:32,014 --> 01:00:33,019
Mimi!

1195
01:01:32,979 --> 01:01:34,739
[Indistinct Chatter]

1196
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:42,099
What have you done!

1197
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:46,659
What kind of a movie
were you shooting for?

1198
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:51,819
I told you not to send her.

1199
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,099
But you wouldn't listen to me.

1200
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,819
Now make her use her full name!

1201
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:05,979
Shama, you have committed
a sin by hiding this from us.

1202
01:02:06,459 --> 01:02:09,179
We treated you like our own
daughter and you betrayed us.

1203
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:13,099
This is how you repay
him for teaching you everything?

1204
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:24,459
What did you tell us, Mimi?

1205
01:02:27,699 --> 01:02:30,779
"I'll make my family proud, Dad."

1206
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,139
"Everyone will learn about our art."

1207
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,459
You have destroyed our family's name.

1208
01:02:39,419 --> 01:02:44,579
You have ruined everything,
my art, my honour, my reputation.

1209
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:53,419
You have broken my trust.

1210
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:57,259
Come on, tell me!

1211
01:02:57,339 --> 01:02:59,299
Tell me who the father is!

1212
01:02:59,419 --> 01:03:02,459
Tell me, who is the
man you got married to, huh?

1213
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,859
Don't tell me you didn't get married.

1214
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:09,419
I will die of shame.

1215
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:13,859
I'll set this house on
fire along with everything else.

1216
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:15,259
I'll set everything on fire.

1217
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:17,019
Who is the father, Mimi?

1218
01:03:17,139 --> 01:03:18,099
Why aren't you saying anything?

1219
01:03:18,219 --> 01:03:19,859
Tell me, who is the father?

1220
01:03:19,939 --> 01:03:20,899
Tell us.

1221
01:03:20,979 --> 01:03:22,419
- Tell me!
- He!

1222
01:03:25,337 --> 01:03:26,299
He?

1223
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:27,419
He?

1224
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:28,539
He?

1225
01:03:30,259 --> 01:03:31,259
Me?

1226
01:03:31,419 --> 01:03:33,179
You got me into all this.

1227
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:36,979
You are the one who convinced
me to have this baby.

1228
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:39,619
Why did you listen to him?

1229
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:42,179
He is old enough to be your father!

1230
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:43,339
No.

1231
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:44,379
I am nowhere close to your age.

1232
01:03:44,459 --> 01:03:45,499
I am just 38 years old.

1233
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:47,419
How can he be Mimi's husband?

1234
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:48,539
He's a Muslim.

1235
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:49,619
Huh?

1236
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:53,099
- He's a Muslim?
- He's a Muslim!

1237
01:03:53,459 --> 01:03:54,699
Oh, my God!

1238
01:03:54,779 --> 01:03:56,179
A Muslim?

1239
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:02,979
Oh God, this is a disaster.

1240
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:04,179
What have you done!

1241
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:07,259
I've seen him with his wife.

1242
01:04:08,459 --> 01:04:09,419
His wife?

1243
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:11,259
His wife?

1244
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:12,419
His wife?

1245
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:15,459
That was his aunt, not his wife.

1246
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:19,219
Listen, I am not a Muslim
and I don't have a wife.

1247
01:04:19,299 --> 01:04:20,139
Hang on.

1248
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:21,579
Here.

1249
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:24,579
Age: 42 years.

1250
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:25,699
Read my name first.

1251
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,779
All you can see is my age, huh?

1252
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:29,499
Bhanupratap Pandey.

1253
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:31,019
He's a Hindu.

1254
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:32,739
That was a close shave, Aunt.

1255
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:35,819
That was a close shave, indeed.

1256
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:39,259
Shobha, you should end this drama now.

1257
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:42,019
Our daughter is pregnant.

1258
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:44,099
You should look after her.

1259
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:52,969
Maansingh, you are the
one who should be blamed for this.

1260
01:04:53,049 --> 01:04:55,739
Why did you let her go alone, huh?

1261
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:58,259
Anyway, we cannot change the past.

1262
01:04:58,339 --> 01:05:00,219
You need to take special care of her now.

1263
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:03,419
She is expecting a child.

1264
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:06,419
You will be grandparents.

1265
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:11,339
Mimi, you too should stop crying.

1266
01:05:11,419 --> 01:05:12,739
Don't cry, my child.

1267
01:05:12,819 --> 01:05:14,419
Wipe your tears, come on.

1268
01:05:14,779 --> 01:05:16,099
You should eat something.

1269
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:18,979
You should not stay
hungry during a pregnancy.

1270
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:22,259
Come on, get up.
Come on.

1271
01:05:24,979 --> 01:05:26,219
What will you have?

1272
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:27,379
Should I make you your favourite meal?

1273
01:05:27,459 --> 01:05:28,539
Would you like to have it?

1274
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:29,579
Come on, my child.

1275
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:56,179
Why doesn't Mimi dress
up like a married woman?

1276
01:05:57,459 --> 01:06:00,459
Perhaps he doesn't inspire
her to dress up like a married woman?

1277
01:06:01,979 --> 01:06:05,979
So, do you have a house of your own,

1278
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:09,419
or you plan to stay here with us?

1279
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:42,619
This is not right, Mimi ji!

1280
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:46,139
I have a mother,
a wife and a house in Delhi.

1281
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,099
Why did you get me into this mess?

1282
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:48,179
You rascal!

1283
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:49,659
I got you into a mess, huh?

1284
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,579
I got you into a mess
or was it vice-versa?

1285
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:53,259
What had you told me, huh?

1286
01:06:53,499 --> 01:06:54,659
"You should do it, Mimi ji."

1287
01:06:54,739 --> 01:06:56,219
"It's just a matter of nine months."

1288
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:57,979
"All your dreams will come true."

1289
01:06:58,819 --> 01:06:59,819
"They are very nice people."

1290
01:06:59,979 --> 01:07:01,339
Nice, my foot!

1291
01:07:01,419 --> 01:07:03,419
They are nice people, huh?

1292
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:05,979
"John ji! Summer ji!"

1293
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:07,459
What happened, huh?
Where are they now, huh?

1294
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:09,419
Where are they?
They ran away!

1295
01:07:10,419 --> 01:07:11,779
Leaving me alone with this baby!

1296
01:07:13,819 --> 01:07:15,459
What example had you given me, huh?

1297
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:18,019
"You just need to grow
their sugarcane in your farm."

1298
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:22,539
I want to shove all
those sugarcanes up yours!

1299
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:26,619
Say something, Bhanupratap Pandey.

1300
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:32,219
You better take care of
this baby once its born.

1301
01:07:32,979 --> 01:07:34,499
I won't keep it.
Got it?

1302
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,139
You've ruined my life.

1303
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:43,859
Why did I listen to you?

1304
01:07:56,979 --> 01:07:59,019
You should go to Mumbai.
Become an actor.

1305
01:07:59,419 --> 01:08:00,499
I'll take care of the baby.

1306
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:02,179
And what will you tell people?

1307
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:07,339
Where were these people when my
husband divorced me?

1308
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:12,819
Don't worry.

1309
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:15,099
I'll handle it.

1310
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:30,539
Aatif?

1311
01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:31,419
Yes?

1312
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:33,499
Mimi's husband--

1313
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:34,739
Your son-in-law?

1314
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:35,979
Right.

1315
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:38,659
When do you think they met?

1316
01:08:39,259 --> 01:08:40,619
When did they get married?

1317
01:08:41,459 --> 01:08:44,739
He must've bamboozled Mimi
during one of her dance performances.

1318
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:48,539
I don't see her falling in
love with a two-bit driver otherwise.

1319
01:08:48,619 --> 01:08:49,459
Hmm.

1320
01:08:50,099 --> 01:08:52,339
He must have done some black magic on her.

1321
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:54,459
Mimi!

1322
01:08:55,619 --> 01:08:56,459
Mimi!

1323
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:57,579
Shobha!

1324
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:58,859
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1325
01:08:59,019 --> 01:09:00,539
I don't know what's wrong.
It just hurts a lot.

1326
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:01,779
You are in pain?

1327
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:03,179
What's wrong?

1328
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:04,699
Let's take her to the doctor.

1329
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:05,819
I'll go call the neighbourhood doctor.

1330
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:06,779
Yes, call him.

1331
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:08,579
No, her doctor is in Jaipur.

1332
01:09:08,659 --> 01:09:10,259
She knows her case quite well.
We will have to go there.

1333
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:11,339
Wear this, dear.

1334
01:09:11,419 --> 01:09:12,579
Come on, my child.

1335
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:14,299
Take your time.

1336
01:09:14,379 --> 01:09:14,979
Be careful.

1337
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:15,419
Be careful.

1338
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:16,339
I'll come with you.

1339
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:17,219
No!

1340
01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:18,179
You guys stay here.

1341
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:18,859
We'll go there alone.

1342
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:20,379
Right, no one will come with us.

1343
01:09:20,459 --> 01:09:21,259
Shut up!

1344
01:09:21,419 --> 01:09:22,339
We will all go with her.

1345
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:23,619
Right, we will all go with her.

1346
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:25,699
We've had enough.
We are done listening to you.

1347
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:26,739
Let's go.

1348
01:09:31,219 --> 01:09:33,379
Calm down.
Take deep breaths.

1349
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:35,099
- Drive faster.
- Okay.

1350
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:37,539
Ouch!

1351
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:38,659
Watch it.

1352
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:39,739
Huh?

1353
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:43,539
Relax, my baby, try to relax.

1354
01:09:55,299 --> 01:09:56,339
It stopped.

1355
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:57,339
It stopped?

1356
01:09:57,419 --> 01:09:58,019
What stopped?

1357
01:09:58,099 --> 01:09:58,979
The pain.

1358
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:00,099
- The pain stopped?
- Yes, it stopped.

1359
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:01,219
She is no longer in pain.

1360
01:10:01,299 --> 01:10:02,459
- You are feeling okay?
- Turn the car around.

1361
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,099
Home?

1362
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,299
Take us home.

1363
01:10:04,419 --> 01:10:05,419
- I am feeling better.
- Okay.

1364
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:06,339
It stopped.

1365
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:11,179
Relax, relax.

1366
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:13,019
- It stopped, right?
- Yes.

1367
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:14,259
It stopped?

1368
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:15,619
- Take us home.
- Okay.

1369
01:10:18,459 --> 01:10:19,819
Mimi, are you feeling okay now?

1370
01:10:21,459 --> 01:10:22,219
Ouch!

1371
01:10:22,299 --> 01:10:22,699
What happened?

1372
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:23,739
It's back! It's back! It's back!

1373
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:24,579
The pain is back.

1374
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:25,499
It's back.

1375
01:10:25,579 --> 01:10:27,419
- Turn the car around.
- Turn the car around, hurry up.

1376
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:29,139
Turn the car around.

1377
01:10:30,219 --> 01:10:31,299
Why don't you drive?

1378
01:10:31,419 --> 01:10:33,659
No, you drive.

1379
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:34,979
It takes time.

1380
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:35,779
It'll all be good.

1381
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:36,659
It's all good. It's all good.

1382
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:38,219
- It'll all be good.
- Right.

1383
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:42,699
Come.

1384
01:10:43,179 --> 01:10:43,819
Follow me.

1385
01:10:45,419 --> 01:10:46,419
Doctor!

1386
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:48,419
- She is in a lot of pain.
- Yes.

1387
01:10:49,019 --> 01:10:50,099
Where's the mother?

1388
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:53,139
What do you mean by where's the mother?

1389
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:54,699
She is carrying the baby,

1390
01:10:54,779 --> 01:10:56,179
so isn't it obvious that she's the mother?

1391
01:10:56,259 --> 01:10:57,539
Are you sure she's a doctor?

1392
01:10:57,819 --> 01:10:59,219
She's the surrogate.

1393
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:00,179
Huh?

1394
01:11:00,459 --> 01:11:01,299
Rubbish.

1395
01:11:01,419 --> 01:11:02,539
She is Mimi.

1396
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:04,619
Or did you change your name as well?

1397
01:11:06,259 --> 01:11:07,339
Surrogate means...

1398
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:10,419
Doctor, it's hurting really bad.

1399
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,739
Please examine her quickly.

1400
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:13,099
Nurse, take her inside.

1401
01:11:13,179 --> 01:11:13,859
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1402
01:11:15,219 --> 01:11:16,219
All of you wait here.

1403
01:11:16,299 --> 01:11:17,659
No, we will go with her.

1404
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:19,219
The doctor has asked us to wait here,
all of us.

1405
01:11:19,299 --> 01:11:20,099
Let her go.

1406
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:20,699
No, no, no.

1407
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:21,859
- No one is allowed in there.
- Mimi?

1408
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:23,619
False labour pains.

1409
01:11:24,459 --> 01:11:26,459
It's known as Braxton-Hicks contractions.

1410
01:11:27,339 --> 01:11:29,419
It is very common during
this time of pregnancy.

1411
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:30,619
Where is Summer?

1412
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:33,099
She ran away,

1413
01:11:34,179 --> 01:11:36,419
because you told her that
there is some problem with this baby.

1414
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:42,459
Oh God, why do people do such things?

1415
01:11:44,059 --> 01:11:45,979
How many times has this
happened before, Doctor?

1416
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:49,779
In the past few years,
in many surrogacy cases,

1417
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:51,979
parents have refused to accept the baby.

1418
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:56,019
They run away, especially the foreigners.

1419
01:11:57,419 --> 01:12:01,019
In such cases,
most of the girls abort the child.

1420
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:05,619
Doctor, from what I have felt,

1421
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:10,339
I believe that the
child inside me is alive.

1422
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:13,979
It grows, it breathes,

1423
01:12:14,099 --> 01:12:16,539
it eats, it moves.

1424
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:19,179
I think it can also hear us.

1425
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:23,219
Then why is it ok to kill
a baby on the inside,

1426
01:12:23,659 --> 01:12:27,420
When it is a crime on the outside?

1427
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:33,539
Why don't people accept the
child inside?

1428
01:12:35,074 --> 01:12:40,219
Irrespective of its condition.
A child is a child right?

1429
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:42,699
Hmm?

1430
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:05,179
"You seem..."

1431
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:08,579
"Like..."

1432
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:15,819
"Yourself..."

1433
01:13:17,179 --> 01:13:22,539
"But this..."

1434
01:13:23,539 --> 01:13:27,419
"Is not you..."

1435
01:13:30,859 --> 01:13:34,339
"Your face..."

1436
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:38,339
"smiles,"

1437
01:13:40,099 --> 01:13:42,979
"But it doesn't reach..."

1438
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,419
"your eyes,"

1439
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:50,619
"Who'd understand..."

1440
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:54,419
"your pain?"

1441
01:13:55,979 --> 01:14:02,979
Who will set you free?"

1442
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:07,419
"Set you free..."

1443
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:11,539
"Set you free..."

1444
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:14,819
"Set you free..."

1445
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:19,539
"Set you free..."

1446
01:14:23,979 --> 01:14:26,859
"Why did your aspirations..."

1447
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:29,779
"End..."

1448
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:34,459
"All your desires..."

1449
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:39,539
"are locked away?"

1450
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:46,099
"All your dreams..."

1451
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:50,459
"fade away..."

1452
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:54,859
"And are wiped clean"

1453
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:03,219
"The waves dont reach the shore"

1454
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:11,219
"They are upset..."

1455
01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:14,459
"Who'd understand..."

1456
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:17,779
"your pain?"

1457
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:27,539
"Who will set you free?"

1458
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:31,459
"Set you free..."

1459
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:35,499
"Set you free..."

1460
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:38,419
"Set you free..."

1461
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:43,259
"Set you free..."

1462
01:15:51,019 --> 01:15:52,019
Can I ask you something?

1463
01:15:56,099 --> 01:15:58,779
You know that you got me into this mess.

1464
01:16:01,579 --> 01:16:07,419
But even if you ran away.
What could I do?

1465
01:16:08,459 --> 01:16:10,619
I wouldn't have
followed you to Delhi.

1466
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:17,859
And even if I did,
you could have easily refused to help me.

1467
01:16:20,339 --> 01:16:21,739
This is not your child.

1468
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:28,539
So why are you still here?

1469
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:35,019
I am a driver, Mimi ji.

1470
01:16:36,499 --> 01:16:38,299
We have some principles.

1471
01:16:39,979 --> 01:16:45,739
The passenger must always
reach his destination...

1472
01:16:49,419 --> 01:16:54,779
There may be bad roads,
potholes, even accidents,

1473
01:16:56,139 --> 01:17:00,579
but that doesn't give me
an excuse to leave them stranded.

1474
01:17:09,539 --> 01:17:13,219
Okay listen,

1475
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:24,979
if you experience any
pain during the night,

1476
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:29,459
then hit me with this bottle.

1477
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,619
You are anyway an expert
at throwing things.

1478
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:35,419
I have a request,
please don't start screaming.

1479
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:39,979
My heart starts sinking
and I start feeling scared.

1480
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:42,139
Hmm?

1481
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:43,699
I won't scream.

1482
01:17:44,179 --> 01:17:45,299
Okay.

1483
01:17:46,419 --> 01:17:47,619
Good night.

1484
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:49,579
Good night.

1485
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:57,539
What's wrong?

1486
01:17:57,619 --> 01:17:59,339
Labour pains!
I'm getting the car.

1487
01:17:59,419 --> 01:18:00,659
Get ready,
we'll have to go to Jaipur.

1488
01:18:01,099 --> 01:18:03,579
Jaipur is too far away.
She'll end up having the baby in the car.

1489
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,419
Let's take her to the
Government Hospital instead.

1490
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:06,339
Yes.
Let's go.

1491
01:18:06,419 --> 01:18:06,699
Okay.

1492
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:07,659
- Let's go.
- Madam!

1493
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:08,979
She is in lot of pain.

1494
01:18:09,099 --> 01:18:11,219
Excuse me, its an emergency.

1495
01:18:11,508 --> 01:18:12,019
Let's go.

1496
01:18:12,099 --> 01:18:12,859
Wait here.

1497
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:14,139
Wait here, all of you.

1498
01:18:14,459 --> 01:18:15,299
Hey...

1499
01:18:19,419 --> 01:18:20,953
She is in so much pain.

1500
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:21,819
Sit down.

1501
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:23,659
Please sit down.

1502
01:18:25,232 --> 01:18:26,299
Shama?

1503
01:18:26,459 --> 01:18:28,419
Mimi is in labour.

1504
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:30,139
We are at the local hospital.

1505
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:31,299
Come quickly.

1506
01:18:41,739 --> 01:18:42,619
What happened?

1507
01:18:45,219 --> 01:18:46,339
We need you to sign here.

1508
01:18:46,419 --> 01:18:46,819
Who me?

1509
01:18:46,979 --> 01:18:47,579
Yes, you.

1510
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:48,979
You are the father, right?

1511
01:18:49,259 --> 01:18:50,859
Yes, he is.

1512
01:18:51,419 --> 01:18:52,819
We didn't have much of a choice.

1513
01:18:53,699 --> 01:18:54,739
Sign it.

1514
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:56,979
I am about to become a father
for the first time. I am so happy.

1515
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,419
My father had become
a grandfather at your age.

1516
01:18:59,499 --> 01:19:01,299
We are against child marriages.

1517
01:19:06,619 --> 01:19:10,339
Push when you feel the pain coming, okay?

1518
01:19:10,499 --> 01:19:11,819
Take deep breaths.

1519
01:19:20,419 --> 01:19:20,779
What's happening?

1520
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:22,979
They've forbidden us from going in there.

1521
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:24,099
Can't I just--

1522
01:19:24,989 --> 01:19:25,979
Sit down.

1523
01:19:26,059 --> 01:19:27,459
Yes, yes, yes. Relax.

1524
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:28,379
Yes, yes, yes.

1525
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:29,499
Calm down, calm down.
We are almost there.

1526
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:30,779
We are almost there.

1527
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:32,299
We are almost there.
Calm down, calm down.

1528
01:19:32,419 --> 01:19:33,619
- Relax, relax.
- I can't do it.

1529
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:35,779
You can do it.

1530
01:19:36,259 --> 01:19:37,859
- You can do it.
- I can't do it.

1531
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,659
Very good. You can do it.

1532
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:42,339
Push when you feel the pain coming, okay?

1533
01:19:42,419 --> 01:19:44,259
Take deep breaths.

1534
01:19:44,419 --> 01:19:46,699
One more push, come on.

1535
01:19:47,339 --> 01:19:50,019
Yes, yes, yes.

1536
01:19:58,062 --> 01:19:59,179
We are almost there.

1537
01:19:59,259 --> 01:19:59,619
We are almost there.

1538
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:00,539
Calm down, calm down.

1539
01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:02,699
Relax, relax.

1540
01:20:02,978 --> 01:20:04,259
Push when you feel the pain coming, okay?

1541
01:20:04,339 --> 01:20:05,139
I can't do it.

1542
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:06,339
You can do it.

1543
01:20:06,419 --> 01:20:08,219
You can do it.

1544
01:20:08,779 --> 01:20:11,219
Take deep breaths. One more push.

1545
01:20:11,419 --> 01:20:12,579
Yes, yes, yes.

1546
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:14,259
You can do it.
Yes.

1547
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:15,379
Yes.

1548
01:20:15,459 --> 01:20:16,139
Very good.

1549
01:20:16,219 --> 01:20:16,659
Very good.

1550
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:17,459
Very good.

1551
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:18,259
Very good.

1552
01:20:18,339 --> 01:20:19,179
Yes.

1553
01:20:19,419 --> 01:20:19,979
Yes.

1554
01:20:20,059 --> 01:20:20,579
Push.

1555
01:20:20,659 --> 01:20:21,579
Push.

1556
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:22,819
One more push.

1557
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:23,819
Yes.

1558
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:56,699
She came.

1559
01:20:57,179 --> 01:20:57,859
Congratulations.

1560
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:58,539
It's a boy.

1561
01:20:58,619 --> 01:20:59,339
Thank God.

1562
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:00,579
Both mother and child are doing well.

1563
01:21:01,462 --> 01:21:03,459
Thank you, Lord.

1564
01:21:03,979 --> 01:21:05,459
This is great.

1565
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:07,859
Can we go meet them?

1566
01:21:08,019 --> 01:21:10,179
Of course,
you can, but only after some time.

1567
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:11,579
Okay.

1568
01:21:12,299 --> 01:21:13,579
It's a boy!

1569
01:21:14,459 --> 01:21:15,659
It's a boy!

1570
01:21:17,059 --> 01:21:17,979
Doctor?

1571
01:21:18,213 --> 01:21:19,139
Yes?

1572
01:21:19,219 --> 01:21:21,539
Is the child normal?

1573
01:21:21,699 --> 01:21:22,779
Yes, he is.

1574
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:23,619
Why do you ask?

1575
01:21:24,339 --> 01:21:28,099
Previous tests showed that
there was a problem with the child.

1576
01:21:28,419 --> 01:21:30,019
There was a problem?
What was the problem?

1577
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:32,019
- Where did you do these tests?
- In Jaipur.

1578
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:35,179
There is a possibility that
the test might have suggested a problem.

1579
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:37,299
But these tests are not always accurate.

1580
01:21:37,539 --> 01:21:39,099
Sometimes the tests
show incorrect results.

1581
01:21:39,419 --> 01:21:41,019
They are known as false positives.

1582
01:21:41,339 --> 01:21:42,179
Don't worry.

1583
01:21:42,259 --> 01:21:43,499
This baby is absolutely fine.

1584
01:23:21,936 --> 01:23:23,459
He is quite fair,
don't you think?

1585
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:24,419
Yes, he is.

1586
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:25,739
He has taken after his dad.

1587
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:33,179
I have to say, I have never
seen such a beautiful child in my life.

1588
01:23:34,339 --> 01:23:36,619
You have given me such a lovely grandson.

1589
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:40,221
No one in the city
has such a beautiful child.

1590
01:23:40,939 --> 01:23:43,059
I forgive you for all your mistakes.

1591
01:23:48,339 --> 01:23:49,419
Where's the baby?

1592
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:51,619
Here.

1593
01:24:01,099 --> 01:24:02,259
Is this Mimi's child?

1594
01:24:02,339 --> 01:24:04,259
You think they left
someone else's child here?

1595
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:05,699
Hmm?

1596
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,619
- Uncle?
- Hmm?

1597
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:12,579
- Uncle--
- Get your hand off me.

1598
01:24:13,259 --> 01:24:16,339
I think Mimi has tricked this driver.

1599
01:24:16,539 --> 01:24:17,819
I think the father
is someone else.

1600
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:18,659
Hey!

1601
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:19,619
No.

1602
01:24:19,819 --> 01:24:22,219
Mimi doesn't look like
uncle's daughter either.

1603
01:24:22,299 --> 01:24:23,459
Right.
Zip it.

1604
01:24:27,139 --> 01:24:28,219
Don't touch him.

1605
01:24:28,299 --> 01:24:29,219
Shut up.

1606
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:32,499
Aatif, click our picture
with the baby?

1607
01:24:38,179 --> 01:24:39,419
This way.

1608
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:41,619
Smile.

1609
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:50,099
What did Mimi do so different
that she had such a beautiful child?

1610
01:24:50,659 --> 01:24:52,099
She ate fabric chalk.

1611
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:54,659
Morning walk.

1612
01:24:56,419 --> 01:24:59,299
Look at them!

1613
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:03,579
Going crazy over a fair baby.

1614
01:25:06,859 --> 01:25:08,819
They are here.

1615
01:25:13,579 --> 01:25:15,419
Look, such a fair baby!

1616
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,819
Stay back, everyone.

1617
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:18,739
"Fair baby! Fair baby!"

1618
01:25:18,859 --> 01:25:20,419
Buzz off!
When will this country

1619
01:25:20,539 --> 01:25:22,699
Stop obsessing over colour!

1620
01:25:24,979 --> 01:25:28,699
Let me ward off the evil.

1621
01:25:30,419 --> 01:25:33,299
You can enter the house
only after I am done.

1622
01:25:34,419 --> 01:25:37,699
Let me have a look at him.

1623
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:45,419
You never stop amazing us, Lord.

1624
01:25:46,019 --> 01:25:49,219
He's like a lotus blooming in muddy water.

1625
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:51,419
Mud?

1626
01:25:53,419 --> 01:25:57,699
Come on,
let's take our lotus inside.

1627
01:25:58,019 --> 01:25:59,059
Let's go.

1628
01:26:01,419 --> 01:26:03,499
He has become a star.

1629
01:26:05,179 --> 01:26:07,019
His mother is also a star.

1630
01:26:08,419 --> 01:26:09,619
Right.

1631
01:26:10,419 --> 01:26:14,219
- Here, feed him.
- Again?

1632
01:26:15,419 --> 01:26:17,619
You can stay.

1633
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:19,259
She is your wife.

1634
01:26:19,659 --> 01:26:20,819
I am allergic.

1635
01:26:20,899 --> 01:26:22,019
Allergic?

1636
01:26:22,499 --> 01:26:23,659
To breast milk?

1637
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:34,579
Feed him 10 times a day.

1638
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:38,019
I'll go make something healthy for you.

1639
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,859
How do you feel?

1640
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:55,139
I don't know.

1641
01:26:57,819 --> 01:26:59,419
I feel different.

1642
01:27:02,859 --> 01:27:04,579
I had never imagined this.

1643
01:27:08,499 --> 01:27:11,259
What we imagine is not life!

1644
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:15,419
What happens to us, is Life.

1645
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:20,539
I had never imagined that
I'd lose mom so early in life.

1646
01:27:21,699 --> 01:27:24,579
Or that dad would
choose a spiritual life.

1647
01:27:25,019 --> 01:27:27,579
Or that the man I'd marry
would turn out to be a monster.

1648
01:27:28,699 --> 01:27:30,019
But what can we do?

1649
01:27:30,819 --> 01:27:32,219
We have to keep moving forward.

1650
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:37,539
Hmm.

1651
01:27:39,539 --> 01:27:41,419
I guess you are right.

1652
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:50,099
So, what have you decided?

1653
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:52,099
What's next?

1654
01:27:54,499 --> 01:27:56,099
Next?

1655
01:27:58,739 --> 01:28:00,619
Change his diaper.

1656
01:28:07,019 --> 01:28:10,979
Bhanu, what's your secret
behind having such a fair child?

1657
01:28:11,059 --> 01:28:13,019
Please share it with me.

1658
01:28:15,859 --> 01:28:17,419
Promise you won't tell anyone?

1659
01:28:24,619 --> 01:28:27,419
Boil red soil with a
pinch of salt and drink it.

1660
01:28:27,739 --> 01:28:29,179
- Really?
- Really.

1661
01:28:29,539 --> 01:28:30,819
Have it twice a day.

1662
01:28:30,979 --> 01:28:36,059
And if you manage to get a strand of
white goat's beard, is magical!

1663
01:28:36,299 --> 01:28:37,499
- A white goat's beard?
- Yes.

1664
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:38,979
Thanks, bro.

1665
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:48,859
Hi Rekhu!

1666
01:28:48,939 --> 01:28:49,859
What is wrong with you?

1667
01:28:50,019 --> 01:28:51,259
Why aren't you taking my calls?

1668
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:53,299
I told you I am busy.

1669
01:28:53,499 --> 01:28:56,059
I am traveling with the American couple.

1670
01:28:56,139 --> 01:28:57,459
Are you showing
them the whole country?

1671
01:28:57,579 --> 01:28:59,219
You remember you have a family, don't you?

1672
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,219
Of course I do,
that's why I sent some money.

1673
01:29:03,579 --> 01:29:04,579
Didn't I come there just a few days back?

1674
01:29:04,659 --> 01:29:06,419
Even took you sightseeing.
What else do you want?

1675
01:29:07,179 --> 01:29:08,139
How's Mom?

1676
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:08,739
Mom?

1677
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:10,979
Mom misses you.

1678
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:12,539
She keeps crying.

1679
01:29:13,054 --> 01:29:14,019
Hello?

1680
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,419
Yes?

1681
01:29:15,499 --> 01:29:18,139
Come back, son.
I am missing you.

1682
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:19,619
I will come back soon.

1683
01:29:19,699 --> 01:29:21,859
People who go to Mumbai don't
come back for years at a stretch.

1684
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:24,019
I keep visiting you, don't I?

1685
01:29:24,419 --> 01:29:25,539
Why do you even bother?

1686
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:27,459
Why don't you go abroad
with that couple?

1687
01:29:27,739 --> 01:29:28,499
Hang up now.

1688
01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:29,739
Hello?
Hello?

1689
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:34,859
You want to know how to have
a fair baby too right?

1690
01:29:35,819 --> 01:29:36,859
Eat turmeric.

1691
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,339
And drink half a glass of milk,

1692
01:29:38,419 --> 01:29:39,859
and use the other half to wash off.

1693
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:41,019
Every day.

1694
01:29:43,059 --> 01:29:44,659
Something is not right, Mom.

1695
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:47,059
It's been months since he last came home.

1696
01:29:47,139 --> 01:29:48,699
He could have come at least once.

1697
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:50,499
What's wrong with this American couple,

1698
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:51,819
they don't seem to want to go back.

1699
01:29:51,979 --> 01:29:53,459
I think I should talk to Altaf.

1700
01:30:02,059 --> 01:30:04,539
Uncle, my brother in Saudi had called.

1701
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:06,259
There's a job opening at his hotel.

1702
01:30:06,339 --> 01:30:07,179
He wants me there.

1703
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:11,339
After learning music for 10 years,
you want to work in a hotel?

1704
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:13,419
I can't help it. I'll have to go.

1705
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:15,219
Very good.

1706
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:16,499
Go.

1707
01:30:17,299 --> 01:30:19,499
When you go there,
find me a suitable job as well.

1708
01:30:20,419 --> 01:30:21,619
Sure, Uncle. I will find
you one as soon as I get there.

1709
01:30:28,619 --> 01:30:30,979
Have you seen him?

1710
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:31,699
Him?

1711
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:33,179
Who hasn't seen him?

1712
01:30:33,259 --> 01:30:34,819
No one is as lucky as he is.

1713
01:30:35,259 --> 01:30:36,459
You know him?

1714
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:38,019
He is Mimi's husband.

1715
01:30:39,939 --> 01:30:40,859
Mimi's husband?

1716
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:41,859
Who is Mimi?

1717
01:30:42,499 --> 01:30:43,419
He's Mimi's husband?

1718
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:45,699
He is Rekha's husband.

1719
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:48,179
Let's go, Mom.

1720
01:30:48,499 --> 01:30:49,579
Have you lost it?

1721
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:52,019
Want another smack?

1722
01:30:53,499 --> 01:30:55,419
What is this lunatic saying?

1723
01:30:57,096 --> 01:31:00,579
Your delicious meals
remind me of my mother.

1724
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:02,059
One day I'll make you meet her.

1725
01:31:04,578 --> 01:31:06,019
Does Mimi stay here?

1726
01:31:09,019 --> 01:31:09,699
Yes.

1727
01:31:11,539 --> 01:31:12,579
You are Mimi?

1728
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:14,339
Yes.
Who are you?

1729
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:17,019
What do you want?

1730
01:31:18,299 --> 01:31:21,419
What's wrong with you?
Why did you marry my husband?

1731
01:31:21,499 --> 01:31:23,339
Any boy would have happily
married you.

1732
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:24,379
Stop your nonsense.

1733
01:31:24,459 --> 01:31:25,739
I think you've got the wrong house.

1734
01:31:25,859 --> 01:31:27,459
Where do you think you are going, huh?

1735
01:31:27,539 --> 01:31:29,219
God cant save you today!

1736
01:31:29,299 --> 01:31:30,539
Dont you dare hide in the temple.

1737
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:31,579
Come with me.

1738
01:31:31,659 --> 01:31:32,339
Come on.

1739
01:31:32,419 --> 01:31:33,379
Why!

1740
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:34,299
Why!

1741
01:31:34,419 --> 01:31:35,619
Why did you do this, huh?

1742
01:31:35,739 --> 01:31:37,379
Don't you have any shame?

1743
01:31:37,459 --> 01:31:39,339
You have no shame?

1744
01:31:40,499 --> 01:31:42,179
Why did you do this, huh?

1745
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:43,339
Why?

1746
01:31:43,419 --> 01:31:46,499
You left your wife for this young witch?

1747
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:48,099
- Wife?
- What?

1748
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:49,459
- His wife?
- Yes.

1749
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:53,339
Oh God, what is going on?

1750
01:31:54,699 --> 01:31:55,859
Son-in-law?

1751
01:31:56,419 --> 01:31:57,339
Is it true?

1752
01:31:57,419 --> 01:31:59,859
He is not your son under any law.

1753
01:32:00,219 --> 01:32:01,179
She is his wife.

1754
01:32:01,259 --> 01:32:02,539
And he is my son.

1755
01:32:02,779 --> 01:32:04,459
Who are you guys, huh?

1756
01:32:06,899 --> 01:32:07,979
Son?

1757
01:32:08,059 --> 01:32:10,059
What is going on, Shobha?

1758
01:32:10,139 --> 01:32:11,379
What are they saying, huh?

1759
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:12,979
He's a married man!

1760
01:32:13,939 --> 01:32:18,179
How many more secrets
does your movie have, Mimi?

1761
01:32:18,379 --> 01:32:20,099
Start talking, you wretch.

1762
01:32:20,379 --> 01:32:24,019
You left your wife for this young girl?

1763
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:26,299
I hope you at least remember
this old mother of yours.

1764
01:32:26,379 --> 01:32:27,819
Rekha!

1765
01:32:28,179 --> 01:32:30,419
Rekhu, please hear me out.

1766
01:32:30,499 --> 01:32:32,019
I don't want to hear a word.

1767
01:32:32,099 --> 01:32:34,179
My life has been ruined.

1768
01:32:35,419 --> 01:32:37,059
Rekhu...

1769
01:32:39,579 --> 01:32:41,219
Is she really your wife?

1770
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:47,499
I cannot believe that two
women are fighting over this driver.

1771
01:32:47,579 --> 01:32:49,339
He has a genie under his command, Uncle.

1772
01:32:49,419 --> 01:32:51,979
Hello, he has no genie under his command.

1773
01:32:52,379 --> 01:32:54,259
I am his wife.
His first and official wife.

1774
01:32:54,339 --> 01:32:57,139
Are you the burqa clad
woman I'd seen with him?

1775
01:33:00,379 --> 01:33:02,299
A burqa clad woman? Mom?

1776
01:33:02,379 --> 01:33:04,779
Oh God! You have a Muslim wife as well?

1777
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:07,299
Didn't I tell you that she was his aunt?

1778
01:33:07,379 --> 01:33:08,539
His aunt?

1779
01:33:08,619 --> 01:33:10,219
But I don't have a sister.

1780
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:12,819
Who was that woman?
Why don't you tell us, huh?

1781
01:33:12,979 --> 01:33:14,019
There you go!

1782
01:33:14,099 --> 01:33:17,499
Bastard! You were already married?

1783
01:33:17,579 --> 01:33:20,659
How dare you marry my
daughter have a child with her!

1784
01:33:20,739 --> 01:33:21,939
- A child!
- Yes.

1785
01:33:22,019 --> 01:33:23,379
- His child?
- Yes.

1786
01:33:26,539 --> 01:33:28,459
Oh hell!

1787
01:33:30,259 --> 01:33:32,379
This is a nightmare!

1788
01:33:33,099 --> 01:33:35,179
He had a child with her?

1789
01:33:36,379 --> 01:33:38,139
That's why he left you, Rekha.

1790
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:42,339
He had a child with this tall witch
because he couldn't have one with you.

1791
01:33:42,419 --> 01:33:43,419
Where's his child?

1792
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:44,379
Where's his child?

1793
01:33:44,459 --> 01:33:46,099
Is that his child?

1794
01:33:46,219 --> 01:33:47,619
Easy! Easy...

1795
01:33:47,699 --> 01:33:48,779
He is asleep.

1796
01:33:54,899 --> 01:33:56,059
Whose child is he?

1797
01:33:56,379 --> 01:33:57,419
He is my child.

1798
01:33:57,499 --> 01:33:58,739
Who is his father?

1799
01:33:58,819 --> 01:34:00,819
Your husband.

1800
01:34:06,379 --> 01:34:08,299
Let me have a look at him.

1801
01:34:11,499 --> 01:34:12,579
What is this?

1802
01:34:12,899 --> 01:34:15,299
This is Bhanu's child?

1803
01:34:15,379 --> 01:34:18,939
Mimi please tell them the
truth before someone ends up dead.

1804
01:34:19,019 --> 01:34:20,219
I am not going to die!

1805
01:34:20,299 --> 01:34:22,339
But I will take your
dead body back with us!

1806
01:34:22,419 --> 01:34:24,419
Where do you think you
are running to, huh?

1807
01:34:24,579 --> 01:34:26,499
You gave her such a beautiful child?

1808
01:34:26,979 --> 01:34:29,819
And all I got was hope.

1809
01:34:30,619 --> 01:34:31,739
He is not the father.

1810
01:34:31,819 --> 01:34:32,739
There!

1811
01:34:33,099 --> 01:34:33,819
Huh?

1812
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:42,259
And I am not married to him.

1813
01:34:47,179 --> 01:34:50,499
What do you mean by
you are not married?

1814
01:34:51,259 --> 01:34:52,699
What are you saying?

1815
01:34:53,259 --> 01:34:54,539
I don't understand.

1816
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,819
Tell me the truth.

1817
01:35:00,019 --> 01:35:01,779
Shama, why don't you
tell us the truth, hmm?

1818
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:06,059
An American couple had come here.

1819
01:35:06,379 --> 01:35:08,779
They had their child
planted inside Mimi's womb.

1820
01:35:09,219 --> 01:35:13,379
They promised her a huge sum
if she'd carry their baby to term.

1821
01:35:13,779 --> 01:35:16,579
But they didn't keep
their word and they ran away.

1822
01:35:16,848 --> 01:35:19,699
They ran away?

1823
01:35:19,819 --> 01:35:21,939
How can they just plant
their child in her womb?

1824
01:35:22,019 --> 01:35:23,979
She must have done something
with that American man...

1825
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:25,499
No Mom, she didn't.

1826
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:26,819
This is a new technology.

1827
01:35:26,899 --> 01:35:27,779
He is their child.

1828
01:35:27,859 --> 01:35:29,619
She just nurtured him in her womb.

1829
01:35:30,299 --> 01:35:32,059
- Oh God!
- I didnt, I swear.

1830
01:35:33,379 --> 01:35:35,019
She isn't married.

1831
01:35:37,179 --> 01:35:38,579
She didn't become a movie star.

1832
01:35:39,379 --> 01:35:41,059
She isn't his mother.

1833
01:35:41,179 --> 01:35:42,779
I am feeling dizzy.

1834
01:35:43,379 --> 01:35:46,619
Aatif, get me some water.

1835
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,419
And put some poison in it.

1836
01:35:49,459 --> 01:35:50,459
Mimi,

1837
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:54,299
you gave birth to this child, right?

1838
01:35:54,379 --> 01:35:55,419
Yes, Mom.

1839
01:35:57,579 --> 01:35:59,379
So you are his mother, right?

1840
01:36:00,379 --> 01:36:01,579
Yes, Mom.

1841
01:36:04,019 --> 01:36:05,379
I am his mother.

1842
01:36:08,379 --> 01:36:10,179
And he belongs to us.

1843
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,299
He is your grandson.

1844
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:13,539
He is our Raj.

1845
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:14,579
Right.

1846
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:39,459
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1847
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:46,259
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1848
01:36:47,139 --> 01:36:52,499
"It's a new dawn."

1849
01:36:53,139 --> 01:36:59,379
"It's a new day."

1850
01:37:00,699 --> 01:37:07,139
"Our destination will
always remain the same,"

1851
01:37:07,419 --> 01:37:13,779
"only the paths will change."

1852
01:37:14,779 --> 01:37:21,739
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1853
01:37:21,819 --> 01:37:29,139
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1854
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:43,299
Mimi, Bunty teased me at school.

1855
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:47,179
He called me a white ghost.

1856
01:37:47,579 --> 01:37:50,539
Why am I so different
from the others, Mimi?

1857
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:52,459
Bunty has no sense.

1858
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:53,979
Don't pay attention to him.

1859
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:57,099
You are not an ordinary child.

1860
01:37:57,979 --> 01:37:59,139
You see that star?

1861
01:38:00,379 --> 01:38:03,019
You were a star just like that one.

1862
01:38:03,379 --> 01:38:04,619
- Then?
- Then what?

1863
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:09,979
A white angel came and gifted you to me.

1864
01:38:10,379 --> 01:38:12,299
He is very smart.

1865
01:38:12,779 --> 01:38:14,139
He is very naughty.

1866
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:17,379
And he... will have a lot of chocolates.

1867
01:38:17,499 --> 01:38:19,059
You don't say!

1868
01:38:19,379 --> 01:38:21,939
I didn't know that, Mimi.

1869
01:38:22,019 --> 01:38:23,659
I didn't know that!

1870
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:50,379
"The ones you've been
humming since ages..."

1871
01:38:50,459 --> 01:38:54,299
"If not the lyric, atleast..."

1872
01:38:54,379 --> 01:38:57,579
"Change the melody of those songs"

1873
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:01,259
"It takes aways so much"

1874
01:39:01,379 --> 01:39:04,739
"Yet returns in so many folds."

1875
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:13,699
"They say,
time takes pleasure in doing so"

1876
01:39:15,383 --> 01:39:22,299
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1877
01:39:22,379 --> 01:39:29,419
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1878
01:39:29,499 --> 01:39:35,459
"It's a new dawn."

1879
01:39:36,019 --> 01:39:41,979
"It's a new day."

1880
01:39:43,699 --> 01:39:49,579
"Our destination will
always remain the same,"

1881
01:39:50,299 --> 01:39:56,619
"only the paths will change."

1882
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:04,619
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1883
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:11,739
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1884
01:40:11,819 --> 01:40:18,699
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1885
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:25,979
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1886
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:32,259
Mimi, why did you name me Raj?

1887
01:40:32,779 --> 01:40:35,379
Because that's what heroes
are called in the movies.

1888
01:40:35,699 --> 01:40:37,259
You are the hero of my movie, aren't you?

1889
01:40:37,379 --> 01:40:39,659
Where's my heroine, Mimi?

1890
01:40:40,019 --> 01:40:41,139
What do you mean where is she?

1891
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:42,019
Who am I then?

1892
01:40:42,099 --> 01:40:43,019
Mimi.

1893
01:40:43,099 --> 01:40:44,139
You don't say!

1894
01:40:44,499 --> 01:40:46,379
I didn't become a heroine because of him,

1895
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:48,259
and he won't even let
me be the star in his life.

1896
01:40:48,579 --> 01:40:50,819
No one values
talent and sacrifice here.

1897
01:40:54,779 --> 01:40:55,939
One... Two...

1898
01:40:57,459 --> 01:40:59,939
Hey you naughty boy Raj.

1899
01:41:00,019 --> 01:41:02,339
Mimi you lost!

1900
01:41:02,419 --> 01:41:04,699
Grandma! I won!

1901
01:41:04,779 --> 01:41:07,419
Grandma, who are these people?

1902
01:41:26,499 --> 01:41:27,579
Hi.

1903
01:41:28,379 --> 01:41:29,379
Look at you.

1904
01:41:32,099 --> 01:41:33,259
Look at you.

1905
01:41:36,419 --> 01:41:37,459
This is not fair.

1906
01:41:37,539 --> 01:41:38,499
You cheat every day.

1907
01:41:50,579 --> 01:41:52,339
Raj, go to your room.

1908
01:41:52,419 --> 01:41:53,539
Ok Mimi.

1909
01:41:57,139 --> 01:41:58,419
I'm sorry.

1910
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:02,739
I'm so so sorry.

1911
01:42:04,259 --> 01:42:05,699
Please forgive me.

1912
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:09,499
Please, I am sorry.

1913
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:14,979
I'm so glad you kept our baby.

1914
01:42:15,059 --> 01:42:16,219
My baby.

1915
01:42:17,619 --> 01:42:24,579
Mimi, this woman saying
that Raj is her son.

1916
01:42:26,379 --> 01:42:29,019
How dare you say that he is your son, huh?

1917
01:42:29,099 --> 01:42:29,579
Don't you have any shame?

1918
01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:31,419
How dare you come back
after four years and say that?

1919
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:32,579
Mimi--

1920
01:42:32,659 --> 01:42:34,979
Mimi, we're so very-very sorry.

1921
01:42:35,059 --> 01:42:36,499
- Sorry?
- Yeah.

1922
01:42:36,979 --> 01:42:40,259
Please, just...
give us a chance to explain.

1923
01:42:43,379 --> 01:42:48,619
Mimi, after we left, we didn't try
to have another baby through surrogacy.

1924
01:42:50,299 --> 01:42:56,299
Please, we were quite disturbed.

1925
01:42:58,579 --> 01:43:01,259
We were just trying to
be happy for all this time.

1926
01:43:03,019 --> 01:43:06,979
One day, we saw a video on Facebook.

1927
01:43:07,819 --> 01:43:16,099
We saw a white boy dancing
with his Indian mother in a hotel.

1928
01:43:17,419 --> 01:43:18,939
We realised that the mother is you.

1929
01:43:19,019 --> 01:43:22,699
Yes, mother is me not you!

1930
01:43:24,099 --> 01:43:25,219
Okay?

1931
01:43:27,379 --> 01:43:28,499
You ran away.

1932
01:43:29,179 --> 01:43:31,219
Because you thought
that your child is faulty.

1933
01:43:32,179 --> 01:43:33,179
There is no fault in the child.

1934
01:43:33,259 --> 01:43:34,819
Your way of thinking is faulty.

1935
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:37,299
The problem lies with you.

1936
01:43:37,379 --> 01:43:40,459
You left your child in
someone's womb and ran away.

1937
01:43:41,819 --> 01:43:43,579
You didn't even think about me.

1938
01:43:44,379 --> 01:43:45,619
What will I do?

1939
01:43:45,699 --> 01:43:47,099
What will happen to the child?

1940
01:43:47,979 --> 01:43:49,539
You'd asked me to abort the child, right?

1941
01:43:50,499 --> 01:43:53,379
And suddenly, after four years,
you realised that you love your child?

1942
01:43:56,059 --> 01:43:57,979
You think you are "mother-father" of Raj?

1943
01:43:58,939 --> 01:43:59,579
No!

1944
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:00,659
No.

1945
01:44:01,379 --> 01:44:03,379
I am "mother-father" of Raj.

1946
01:44:04,219 --> 01:44:05,299
I gave birth to him.

1947
01:44:05,379 --> 01:44:06,939
I nurtured him.
I raised him, not you.

1948
01:44:07,019 --> 01:44:07,939
Got it?

1949
01:44:12,739 --> 01:44:14,779
Why are you here?
What do you want?

1950
01:44:18,259 --> 01:44:19,259
Our baby.

1951
01:44:19,379 --> 01:44:20,539
Don't even think about it.

1952
01:44:21,379 --> 01:44:22,939
Don't you dare think about it!

1953
01:44:25,379 --> 01:44:26,379
Get out.

1954
01:44:35,099 --> 01:44:36,779
Please forgive me.

1955
01:44:51,979 --> 01:44:53,219
Mimi!

1956
01:45:02,119 --> 01:45:03,539
Mimi look at this!

1957
01:45:04,379 --> 01:45:06,099
This is our house.

1958
01:45:07,419 --> 01:45:08,779
This is me.

1959
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:10,379
That's you.

1960
01:45:11,379 --> 01:45:12,699
That's Bhanu.

1961
01:45:12,779 --> 01:45:15,139
Aunt Shama.

1962
01:45:15,299 --> 01:45:17,779
And grandma grandpa.

1963
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:21,619
What's wrong, Mimi?

1964
01:45:22,939 --> 01:45:23,779
Nothing.

1965
01:45:23,939 --> 01:45:26,059
You didn't like my drawing?

1966
01:45:26,299 --> 01:45:28,059
Your drawing is perfect.

1967
01:45:28,219 --> 01:45:29,379
Then whats the problem?

1968
01:45:31,459 --> 01:45:33,699
You'll never leave your Mimi, right?

1969
01:45:34,059 --> 01:45:35,419
Never.

1970
01:45:36,699 --> 01:45:37,739
Promise?

1971
01:45:38,059 --> 01:45:39,379
Promise.

1972
01:45:50,019 --> 01:45:51,179
How can they just ask
us to give the child back?

1973
01:45:51,259 --> 01:45:53,259
How dare they come back!

1974
01:45:53,619 --> 01:45:54,739
They think this is a joke?

1975
01:45:54,979 --> 01:45:56,499
Why didn't you slap her?

1976
01:45:57,419 --> 01:45:58,579
Shameless woman!

1977
01:45:59,579 --> 01:46:01,059
Like he is some toy,

1978
01:46:01,379 --> 01:46:02,579
that they left behind
and now want back.

1979
01:46:02,659 --> 01:46:04,259
They have no right over the child.

1980
01:46:04,539 --> 01:46:05,739
If they cause trouble, don't worry...

1981
01:46:05,819 --> 01:46:07,259
I am friends with a few cops.

1982
01:46:18,299 --> 01:46:21,739
We have brought some toys for Raj.

1983
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:26,379
From the US.

1984
01:46:28,619 --> 01:46:29,779
I have personally bought them.

1985
01:46:29,939 --> 01:46:30,779
We don't want them!

1986
01:46:34,019 --> 01:46:35,259
Why are you back?

1987
01:46:37,659 --> 01:46:41,379
Mimi, please understand.

1988
01:46:45,099 --> 01:46:46,339
We have faced a lot.

1989
01:46:46,419 --> 01:46:47,694
I too have faced a lot.

1990
01:46:47,774 --> 01:46:50,019
Please, please listen.

1991
01:46:55,179 --> 01:46:57,499
Raj is our last hope.

1992
01:46:59,699 --> 01:47:01,779
You can have another child.

1993
01:47:02,779 --> 01:47:04,619
But I can't.

1994
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:08,699
Raj will be happy with us.

1995
01:47:09,379 --> 01:47:12,699
You became a surrogate
For a brighter future, Mimi.

1996
01:47:15,059 --> 01:47:17,499
What will you do for Raj's future, huh?

1997
01:47:23,099 --> 01:47:25,379
We'll give him the best life in US.

1998
01:47:27,099 --> 01:47:28,379
- You--
- Mimi!

1999
01:47:29,699 --> 01:47:30,819
Mimi!

2000
01:47:34,579 --> 01:47:35,499
Hi!

2001
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:36,419
Hey!

2002
01:47:41,899 --> 01:47:42,499
Hey!

2003
01:47:46,619 --> 01:47:48,379
I hear your name is Raj.

2004
01:47:51,142 --> 01:47:51,979
My name is John.

2005
01:47:55,419 --> 01:47:56,379
This is Summer.

2006
01:47:57,939 --> 01:47:58,819
Hi!

2007
01:47:59,659 --> 01:48:00,419
Hi!

2008
01:48:01,379 --> 01:48:04,139
Auntie, are these for me?

2009
01:48:04,459 --> 01:48:05,739
Yes.

2010
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:07,259
We brought them for you.

2011
01:48:08,019 --> 01:48:09,059
Look at this.

2012
01:48:10,486 --> 01:48:11,379
Look.

2013
01:48:14,379 --> 01:48:16,419
So many toys!

2014
01:48:16,579 --> 01:48:18,539
Aeroplane!

2015
01:48:18,619 --> 01:48:20,099
Remote Control!

2016
01:48:21,419 --> 01:48:22,419
See...

2017
01:48:22,739 --> 01:48:24,179
It can fly.

2018
01:48:24,379 --> 01:48:31,179
Auntie, are you the same white
angel who had left me with Mimi?

2019
01:48:37,099 --> 01:48:38,179
Yes.

2020
01:48:38,259 --> 01:48:39,619
That's me.

2021
01:48:44,419 --> 01:48:45,579
Raj, come with me.

2022
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:46,739
You need to get ready for school.

2023
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:47,979
Mimi let me go.

2024
01:48:48,619 --> 01:48:49,979
I don't have school today, Mimi.

2025
01:48:53,379 --> 01:48:54,419
Please let him play.

2026
01:48:59,619 --> 01:49:01,379
Look it flies!

2027
01:49:09,139 --> 01:49:10,179
Thank you, Mimi.

2028
01:49:10,619 --> 01:49:12,979
I feel so alive being around him.

2029
01:49:15,379 --> 01:49:16,379
Angel Auntie?

2030
01:49:17,299 --> 01:49:18,499
It has stopped working.

2031
01:49:18,579 --> 01:49:19,699
Okay.

2032
01:49:20,379 --> 01:49:21,499
Wait.

2033
01:49:24,059 --> 01:49:25,219
Let me help.

2034
01:49:25,656 --> 01:49:26,939
There you go.

2035
01:49:32,459 --> 01:49:37,619
I swear Mimi, I haven't seen
Summer this happy in four years.

2036
01:49:38,099 --> 01:49:39,179
Enough of this drama.

2037
01:49:40,379 --> 01:49:41,819
Raj isn't your child.

2038
01:49:41,979 --> 01:49:43,179
He is Mimi's son.

2039
01:49:45,379 --> 01:49:47,379
No Bhanu, he isn't.

2040
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:50,099
Look at him.

2041
01:49:50,741 --> 01:49:51,739
Look.

2042
01:49:56,939 --> 01:49:58,379
You think he belongs here?

2043
01:49:59,739 --> 01:50:00,939
No.

2044
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:05,459
He's our son and we're
not going back without him.

2045
01:50:10,379 --> 01:50:13,499
You don't know this, but Summer tried to--

2046
01:50:17,059 --> 01:50:19,219
Summer attempted suicide.

2047
01:50:20,779 --> 01:50:22,819
Now do you want her
to die because I don't.

2048
01:50:24,779 --> 01:50:25,939
I'm not gonna let that happen.

2049
01:50:26,019 --> 01:50:28,579
And I will go to any extent
for my wife's happiness.

2050
01:50:32,139 --> 01:50:38,539
So, give me my son back or
I will take legal action against you.

2051
01:50:44,419 --> 01:50:45,819
Do you understand?

2052
01:51:26,419 --> 01:51:27,739
Raj!

2053
01:51:28,739 --> 01:51:29,619
You...!

2054
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:30,939
You just wait there, you scoundrel.

2055
01:51:31,219 --> 01:51:32,059
Are you blind?

2056
01:51:32,139 --> 01:51:33,379
Are you blind?

2057
01:51:33,459 --> 01:51:34,219
Can't you see?

2058
01:51:34,299 --> 01:51:35,779
- You couldn't see my baby?
- Mimi! Mimi!

2059
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,379
What if something would
have happened to him?

2060
01:51:37,459 --> 01:51:39,139
He was playing in the middle of the road.

2061
01:51:39,579 --> 01:51:41,699
- So what?
- He was playing on the road.

2062
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:43,099
- He can play wherever he wants.
- Let him go.

2063
01:51:43,179 --> 01:51:43,939
He is my child.

2064
01:51:44,019 --> 01:51:45,139
Let him go, Mimi.

2065
01:51:45,219 --> 01:51:46,219
He was playing on the road.

2066
01:51:46,299 --> 01:51:48,419
Who are you to tell me where
he can play and cannot play?

2067
01:51:48,539 --> 01:51:49,139
Please go.

2068
01:51:49,219 --> 01:51:50,459
- Buzz off.
- Go.

2069
01:51:51,219 --> 01:51:52,979
- Come on, Mimi.
- Let's go inside, Mimi.

2070
01:52:14,739 --> 01:52:15,659
John ji.

2071
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:17,099
Summer ji.

2072
01:52:20,379 --> 01:52:24,619
I am sorry to learn
what you have been through.

2073
01:52:25,459 --> 01:52:27,659
I heard you tried to commit suicide.

2074
01:52:30,659 --> 01:52:38,499
Summer ji, sometimes it
is easier to die than to survive.

2075
01:52:39,379 --> 01:52:44,219
You two left her in that state,
but Mimi still survived and she fought.

2076
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:49,379
She fought with herself,
with the society and her dreams.

2077
01:52:50,099 --> 01:52:51,659
It has been a long,
uphill battle for her.

2078
01:52:53,779 --> 01:52:56,379
You know she wanted
to be a movie star.

2079
01:52:56,739 --> 01:52:59,299
She is the most beautiful
girl in Shekhawati.

2080
01:52:59,379 --> 01:53:01,219
She is the best dancer we have here.

2081
01:53:02,659 --> 01:53:05,059
She wanted to go to Mumbai
and join the film industry.

2082
01:53:05,419 --> 01:53:09,299
After Raj was born,
she bundled up all her dreams,

2083
01:53:09,379 --> 01:53:12,299
and threw them somewhere
far away in the desert.

2084
01:53:13,739 --> 01:53:15,379
Raj is her world now.

2085
01:53:16,699 --> 01:53:19,139
And now you came and take legal action?

2086
01:53:20,739 --> 01:53:22,019
Listen Bhanu--

2087
01:53:22,099 --> 01:53:25,699
Listen, listen John,
you think Mimi is alone?

2088
01:53:26,419 --> 01:53:27,379
No.

2089
01:53:28,539 --> 01:53:29,779
We are with her.

2090
01:53:31,019 --> 01:53:33,539
You can go anywhere you want,
approach any court you want.

2091
01:53:33,739 --> 01:53:35,099
We are ready to fight.

2092
01:53:37,699 --> 01:53:38,939
Let's go.

2093
01:53:58,699 --> 01:53:59,939
Mimi?

2094
01:54:36,379 --> 01:54:41,539
The angel is back to take her star.

2095
01:54:46,019 --> 01:54:48,779
How do I fight an angel, Shama?

2096
01:55:57,779 --> 01:56:02,699
This contract clearly states that you need
to hand over the child after the delivery,

2097
01:56:03,259 --> 01:56:06,299
if they pay you what
they had agreed upon.

2098
01:56:06,979 --> 01:56:08,299
You will have to handle
the child over to them.

2099
01:56:08,699 --> 01:56:11,219
But they ran away,
leaving the child with her.

2100
01:56:11,299 --> 01:56:14,019
That doesn't give Mimi
legal rights over the child.

2101
01:56:14,539 --> 01:56:17,299
They will do a DNA test and
prove their paternity in the court.

2102
01:56:19,019 --> 01:56:22,379
Bhanu, we can fight a case against them,
but it won't be easy.

2103
01:56:22,659 --> 01:56:24,699
It will be a long and
an expensive legal battle.

2104
01:56:25,379 --> 01:56:29,219
Mimi and the child will have to
be present in the court for every hearing.

2105
01:56:29,299 --> 01:56:31,379
Why does the child
need to go to the court?

2106
01:56:31,499 --> 01:56:33,419
The case won't move forward without him.

2107
01:56:33,579 --> 01:56:35,139
We are fighting this case for him.

2108
01:56:37,299 --> 01:56:38,379
I'll get going now.

2109
01:56:43,379 --> 01:56:47,179
Bhanu, let me know when the case is filed.

2110
01:56:47,259 --> 01:56:48,379
- Okay.
- We will try our best.

2111
01:56:48,819 --> 01:56:49,619
Okay.

2112
01:56:51,619 --> 01:56:53,259
I will walk you out.

2113
01:56:56,139 --> 01:56:57,539
Don't worry, Mimi.

2114
01:56:58,219 --> 01:56:59,139
You have our support.

2115
01:57:01,379 --> 01:57:07,739
You gave birth to him and
you are the one bringing him up.

2116
01:57:10,379 --> 01:57:13,379
So how can she be his mother?

2117
01:57:14,659 --> 01:57:17,139
Raj might look like a westerner,

2118
01:57:17,659 --> 01:57:19,619
but at heart he is an Indian,
just like us.

2119
01:57:20,779 --> 01:57:22,059
He speaks our language.

2120
01:57:22,139 --> 01:57:23,299
He eats our food.

2121
01:57:23,379 --> 01:57:24,699
So how can he belong to them?

2122
01:57:25,379 --> 01:57:26,619
I have told him that
we want to go ahead with it.

2123
01:57:27,579 --> 01:57:30,579
I'll sell my car if we
need money to fight the case.

2124
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:34,179
We can also sell this house if required.

2125
01:57:35,259 --> 01:57:36,619
It is quite old.

2126
01:57:36,699 --> 01:57:38,939
We're just four of us.

2127
01:57:39,019 --> 01:57:40,299
We don't need such a big house.

2128
01:57:40,379 --> 01:57:42,379
Raj should go to America,

2129
01:57:45,619 --> 01:57:47,259
with John and Summer.

2130
01:57:50,379 --> 01:57:52,179
How can you say that, Mimi?

2131
01:57:54,379 --> 01:57:55,979
Don't let them beguile you.

2132
01:57:56,659 --> 01:57:58,179
Raj is your son.

2133
01:57:58,779 --> 01:57:59,979
It was my farm,

2134
01:58:02,379 --> 01:58:04,699
but the seed
and manure was theirs

2135
01:58:06,379 --> 01:58:07,979
Have you lost your mind?

2136
01:58:09,779 --> 01:58:11,259
Do you even know what you are saying?

2137
01:58:12,219 --> 01:58:13,379
I know, Mom.

2138
01:58:16,099 --> 01:58:19,099
I just needed
money to go to Mumbai.

2139
01:58:20,379 --> 01:58:22,019
It was Summer who wanted a child.

2140
01:58:24,019 --> 01:58:25,939
She was the one who wanted to be a mother.

2141
01:58:27,819 --> 01:58:29,739
I wanted to be a movie star.

2142
01:58:31,939 --> 01:58:32,819
What about me?

2143
01:58:34,379 --> 01:58:36,939
Have you ever thought about what I wanted?

2144
01:58:38,099 --> 01:58:43,099
I just wanted happiness and
Raj is the one who gave it to me.

2145
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:45,499
He is my grandson.

2146
01:58:46,779 --> 01:58:49,939
You too considered him as
your son after you gave birth to him.

2147
01:58:50,019 --> 01:58:52,299
Not just you,
we all considered him as your son.

2148
01:58:54,379 --> 01:58:59,019
My wife says, "It's a good thing,
we don't have a child of our own."

2149
01:58:59,099 --> 01:59:01,019
"Raj doesn't have to compete
with anyone for our love."

2150
01:59:02,779 --> 01:59:06,019
We keep looking for excuses
to come and meet him.

2151
01:59:08,739 --> 01:59:10,419
He is the soul of this house.

2152
01:59:11,459 --> 01:59:15,419
We will go to any court we have to.

2153
01:59:15,539 --> 01:59:16,939
We will fight for him.

2154
01:59:17,379 --> 01:59:18,619
What will we gain from it, huh?

2155
01:59:20,979 --> 01:59:27,939
We will fight the case for
years but what will we prove by that?

2156
01:59:28,379 --> 01:59:29,979
That Raj isn't their child?

2157
01:59:31,139 --> 01:59:35,379
Anyone who sees Raj with Summer
and John will now that he is their child.

2158
01:59:37,379 --> 01:59:40,619
They will keep calling Raj to
court and bombard him with questions.

2159
01:59:40,699 --> 01:59:42,059
What will he say?

2160
01:59:44,299 --> 01:59:45,779
He is just a child.

2161
01:59:47,379 --> 01:59:48,259
No.

2162
01:59:48,659 --> 01:59:50,659
I don't want him to go through this.

2163
01:59:52,939 --> 01:59:57,139
Mimi, you have made many wrong decisions.

2164
01:59:58,459 --> 02:00:00,139
Don't make a wrong decision this time.

2165
02:00:01,259 --> 02:00:04,379
Our lives are at stake.

2166
02:00:07,219 --> 02:00:10,379
We cannot take a child
away from his mother, Dad.

2167
02:00:16,299 --> 02:00:18,299
Summer is his real mother, Mom.

2168
02:00:20,699 --> 02:00:22,219
Let her have him.

2169
02:00:45,379 --> 02:00:49,179
"Oh my little birdie,"

2170
02:00:49,259 --> 02:00:52,939
"Oh my little birdie,"

2171
02:00:53,019 --> 02:00:59,619
"Where are you going?"

2172
02:01:00,419 --> 02:01:04,299
"Oh my little birdie,"

2173
02:01:04,379 --> 02:01:07,979
"Oh my little birdie,"

2174
02:01:08,059 --> 02:01:15,019
"Where are you going?"

2175
02:01:15,779 --> 02:01:19,539
"Why are you leaving your home?"

2176
02:01:19,619 --> 02:01:23,299
"Why are you leaving your family?"

2177
02:01:23,379 --> 02:01:28,579
"Why are you leaving your mother?"

2178
02:01:28,659 --> 02:01:31,019
"Oh my child,"

2179
02:01:31,099 --> 02:01:36,379
"Why are you leaving your mother?"

2180
02:01:38,739 --> 02:01:42,539
"Oh my little birdie,"

2181
02:01:42,619 --> 02:01:46,299
"Oh my little birdie,"

2182
02:01:46,379 --> 02:01:53,379
"Where are you going?"

2183
02:02:06,739 --> 02:02:08,219
Mimi!

2184
02:02:12,739 --> 02:02:14,299
Mimi!

2185
02:02:17,019 --> 02:02:18,179
Come here, my boy.

2186
02:02:18,259 --> 02:02:21,659
Mimi, why aren't you coming
with me in the aeroplane?

2187
02:02:22,699 --> 02:02:24,259
- I have a show.
- Yes.

2188
02:02:26,019 --> 02:02:27,419
You love my shows, don't you?

2189
02:02:27,499 --> 02:02:29,539
Yes, I love them.

2190
02:02:30,059 --> 02:02:33,179
I'll finish my show and join you, okay?

2191
02:02:35,539 --> 02:02:37,259
You know what you have to do until then?

2192
02:02:37,379 --> 02:02:42,019
I have to be nice to Aunt
Summer and play with Uncle John.

2193
02:02:42,099 --> 02:02:43,699
I have to be a good boy.

2194
02:02:44,739 --> 02:02:51,699
"Love is a strange thing."

2195
02:02:52,419 --> 02:02:59,419
"It is hard to comprehend."

2196
02:03:00,019 --> 02:03:07,579
"We won't hear you
play in the house again."

2197
02:03:07,659 --> 02:03:14,739
"But your presence will
still be felt everywhere."

2198
02:03:15,379 --> 02:03:21,779
"Our tears will stop one day,"

2199
02:03:21,939 --> 02:03:27,939
"but the void that we
feel will never go away."

2200
02:03:52,019 --> 02:03:55,139
We are going back.

2201
02:03:59,620 --> 02:04:03,259
Raj is your son, Mimi.

2202
02:04:06,979 --> 02:04:09,539
And thats my daughter, over there.

2203
02:04:37,499 --> 02:04:39,499
We drove past an orphanage.

2204
02:04:42,379 --> 02:04:43,619
There she was.

2205
02:04:45,499 --> 02:04:47,019
She was crying,

2206
02:04:49,099 --> 02:04:50,659
as though she was waiting for us.

2207
02:04:56,379 --> 02:04:58,819
She wanted a home and we wanted a child.

2208
02:05:00,379 --> 02:05:04,579
So we met the lawyer, we're adopting her.

2209
02:05:07,939 --> 02:05:09,379
Isn't she cute?

2210
02:05:09,699 --> 02:05:13,419
Summer ji, you are adopting her?

2211
02:05:14,819 --> 02:05:16,139
Yes.

2212
02:05:25,019 --> 02:05:26,379
Mimi,

2213
02:05:27,779 --> 02:05:31,739
I cant forcefully take Raj away from you
and be happy.

2214
02:05:33,299 --> 02:05:34,619
And what about Raj?

2215
02:05:35,379 --> 02:05:36,819
Will he be able to stay with me?

2216
02:05:38,379 --> 02:05:39,699
Without you?

2217
02:05:40,539 --> 02:05:42,219
That's not possible, Mimi.

2218
02:05:43,619 --> 02:05:50,019
You know what I realised
after I saw you with Raj?

2219
02:05:51,979 --> 02:05:56,699
That you don't need to give
birth to a child to be a parent.

2220
02:05:58,379 --> 02:06:06,299
And that you don't need to
have your own child to be a parent.

2221
02:06:06,379 --> 02:06:07,619
Thank you.

2222
02:06:15,059 --> 02:06:16,139
Thanks.

2223
02:06:16,699 --> 02:06:17,779
Thank you.

2224
02:06:22,939 --> 02:06:24,219
Thanks.

2225
02:06:24,779 --> 02:06:29,819
I'll love her just
as much as you love Raj.

2226
02:06:32,179 --> 02:06:33,379
Mimi,

2227
02:06:35,379 --> 02:06:39,099
we hope that we can raise our
little girl the way you raised Raj.

2228
02:06:41,379 --> 02:06:42,419
Hi!

2229
02:06:43,499 --> 02:06:44,979
Hello.

2230
02:06:45,259 --> 02:06:46,379
What is your name?

2231
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:47,699
Tara.

2232
02:06:47,779 --> 02:06:48,699
Tara.

2233
02:06:49,296 --> 02:06:51,219
Raj, say hello to Tara.

2234
02:06:55,379 --> 02:06:56,379
She is so cute.

2235
02:07:02,019 --> 02:07:05,299
Auntie, I want to go in an aeroplane.

2236
02:07:05,379 --> 02:07:08,939
Raj, just get into my
car and fasten your seatbelt,

2237
02:07:09,019 --> 02:07:11,659
I'll make my car fly like an aeroplane.

2238
02:07:12,419 --> 02:07:15,939
Your granny and your mom
can be your airhostesses.

2239
02:07:17,539 --> 02:07:18,499
Do you have any more questions?

2240
02:07:18,579 --> 02:07:21,739
Mimi, when someone pees in the aeroplane,

2241
02:07:21,819 --> 02:07:24,179
does it fall on the ground?

2242
02:07:31,379 --> 02:07:32,739
See you, Summer ji.

2243
02:07:38,619 --> 02:07:40,939
"They say..."

2244
02:07:42,579 --> 02:07:46,219
"They say what you give is yours..."

2245
02:07:46,459 --> 02:07:50,379
"Play..."

2246
02:07:50,779 --> 02:07:54,419
"In my lap my moonchild."

2247
02:07:54,499 --> 02:07:58,779
"In the middle of the
night I still think of you"

2248
02:07:58,939 --> 02:08:03,019
"I see you in my eyes,
how will I get through?"

2249
02:08:03,099 --> 02:08:06,299
"All I can say is I'm sorry"
