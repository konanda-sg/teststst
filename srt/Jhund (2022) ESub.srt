1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,360
Nandu, why are you smoking
in front of the hospital?

2
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,920
My wife is not well,
she's in there.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,680
What happened?

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,600
Woman's illness.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,640
Woman's illness!

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,800
The cost is...
- How much for the cigarette?

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,760
Ten bucks.
- Ten bucks!

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
How many more do you have
in your pocket?

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,920
One more.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,600
You have money to die,
but no money to save your wife.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,200
What nonsense?

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,440
Look, it says death, right here.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,120
This sanitary pack gives you life.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,080
Don't laugh.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,080
This costs as much as two cigarettes

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,040
and can save your wife
from contracting diseases

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,400
that she can get while
she is menstruating.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,160
You can save yourself
by quitting smoking, too.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,200
It means you can save two
lives from this money.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,360
Your life as well as your wife's.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,040
Think and smile.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,520
Smoking doesn't make you a hero.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,440
You'll be a hero
if you give someone this.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,720
'Choose life, not death.'

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
'Save yourself and
your loved ones.'

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:44,840
'T Series Films.'

27
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,360
'Aatpaat.'

28
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,080
Got drunk again?

29
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,640
You won't quit, will you?

30
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,520
Do you hear me?

31
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,680
Cat got your tongue now?

32
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
I can't take this anymore.

33
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,360
You hear me?

34
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
You are suddenly dumb, eh?

35
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,040
Day or night, you always
walk in a drunken stupor!

36
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,280
That's your job,
right, you worthless wuss?

37
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,120
What for? His woman is
slogging away for strangers.

38
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll die working for others.
- Didn't I give you money yesterday?

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
In your dreams yeah?
Shameless!

40
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,480
You've killed the happiness
in this home.

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,240
What's this crap daily, you moron?

42
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,440
Just look at him.
Dear, he troubles me every day.

43
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,760
I slog all day in the bungalows
and he just drinks the whole day.

44
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
Who gives you money
for the booze?

45
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,360
Who else? Give me 10, 20, 100, 50!

46
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll give him poison someday.
Let's bowl him out together!

47
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
Enough with your shenanigans!

48
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,920
I am not a god-damn magician!
Hold your horse.

49
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,280
Watch and fix it. Come!

50
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
What's up, boy!

51
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,360
You crazy son of a gun!

52
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
Hey gorgeous.

53
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
Go to hell.

54
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,160
'Mahatma Phule Market.'

55
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,680
Hey lady, is there
a Paranjape School nearby?

56
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,800
I don't know.
- How about a police station then?

57
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,640
Let's go.
- It's over there.

58
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,800
Thief!

59
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Go, go, go!

60
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,800
Hey!

61
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
'The Horde'.

62
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,880
Am I not a human?

63
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,360
Don't talk crap.

64
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,360
I will shut up.
You carry on screaming!

65
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,040
Don't teach me stuff.

66
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,920
Teaching me, yeah?
- What did I say?

67
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No way, I can have three daughters!

68
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
You definitely slept around
with someone else!

69
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,040
I did what? And had three daughters?
You sick animal!

70
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,160
Don't call me that.
I'll slam these three to death.

71
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,760
If only you were a little literate!

72
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,600
I'll slam them to their deaths!
- Move...

73
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,680
Let go. I said, let go!

74
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,600
Let's go, Rahat, quick.

75
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,560
Razia.

76
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,400
Razia, where are you going?
- Nowhere.

77
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,760
Come home, don't create a scene!
Let's go home!

78
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,280
Razia...

79
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
Come home. Come.
- Walk.

80
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,240
scene? I am creating a scene?

81
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,320
I am telling you.
- What?

82
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,520
Don't create a scene in public.

83
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's go home!
- What scene!

84
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,000
You'll pay for this, I warn you!

85
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
Pay for this?
You've already ruined my life.

86
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,520
What else can you do?

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
What will you do?

88
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,760
Come home with me,
- I will not come.

89
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
I am telling you again!

90
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
Will you divorce me?
You won't even dare!

91
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,160
I divorce you. Here goes,
divorce, divorce, divorce!

92
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,240
Go to hell!

93
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,400
You moron, what's this bulls**t
out on the street?

94
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Come.

95
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
She is my wife.

96
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,320
So what? Want to dance
with her right here?

97
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,120
Beat it or else I'll whop you.

98
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,680
There he goes!
Always ready for a fight!

99
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,640
Get going.

100
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Let him go.

101
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,760
Get lost or I'll sock you one!

102
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,280
Cops are coming! Run!

103
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
Don, give me some.

104
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Prem. It will take some time, bro.
- Hold on, I am going there.

105
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
Did you see this s**t?

106
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,680
Never mind that.

107
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,240
Look, fancy pants is looking at us.

108
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
Let it go. He must be a local.

109
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,080
What's this rich boy doing
in our slum?

110
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,680
What are you looking at?
- What?

111
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,280
Why are you staring at me?
- What?

112
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,480
Don't you know who I am?
- Let go.

113
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,080
I won't. What are you gonna do?
- Let go of my collar and back off.

114
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,720
You want a beating?
- You'll hit me, yeah?

115
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,120
Tell me, want to hit me or get hit?
- Back off.

116
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,800
I won't. What will you do?

117
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,560
What's up?

118
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Move!

119
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,440
What's up?

120
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,160
You junkies! Trying to act smart?

121
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,840
You want me to sober you up?

122
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,560
He was staring at me. I thought he
was calling me. I came to say hello.

123
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,800
Keep quiet.

124
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Get lost, right away.
- Let go of my hand.

125
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,400
Buzz off.
You too, skunk face! Full speed.

126
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,640
You!

127
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,840
Hit me! Hit me! It's your day today.
- What happened?

128
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Trying to be smart, huh?

129
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,800
Stop...

130
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,560
Hey.

131
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,040
You hit me!
- Hey!

132
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
He hit me.

133
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,800
What are you doing?
- He hit me.

134
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
Keep quiet!

135
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
He is beating me.
- Quiet!

136
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,160
Quiet! Keep quiet!

137
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,120
Why are you fighting with him?
- I don't know.

138
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,080
You don't know?

139
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,840
He messed with me.
- Hey! Wait!

140
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,120
Why did you start a fight with him?

141
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
Where do you live?

142
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,400
Around here. This is my territory.

143
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,440
Your territory?
Are you the king of the jungle?

144
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,560
Which college do you go to?
- No college and stuff for me.

145
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,040
You don't, yeah?

146
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,440
You two have some old rivalry
or something? Wait.

147
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,400
I don't even know him.
- You don't even know?

148
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
He jumped on me like a rabid dog!
- Hey.

149
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
Why did you start a fight with him?
- He was staring at me.

150
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,880
What?
- Staring!

151
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,840
Staring?

152
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,680
So anyone who stares at you
you'll beat him up?

153
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,920
Now I am staring at you. Look up!

154
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,040
I am staring at you.
You'll beat me up as well?

155
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,640
Never mind, Uncle.
Stop bugging me.

156
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,880
I will deal with you later.
- Go away! Go!

157
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,320
What is it?
- God knows.

158
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
What's your name?

159
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,840
What are you chewing?

160
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,720
Hrithik.
- Hrithik?

161
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,040
You are chewing tobacco, yes?
- Scented betel nut.

162
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,840
It is tobacco!

163
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,200
You go to school?

164
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,320
Hey you!

165
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,840
What is it?
Look, he is doing? See.

166
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,640
(Indistinct chatter)

167
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,160
How's your health?
- Good.

168
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,680
Do you still go for a morning walk?
- I just can't find it.

169
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,120
It's at the right place, Arjun.

170
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,560
Which right place?

171
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,520
What's happening?
- Movie. Awesome.

172
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,160
We are looking for a bathroom.
- It's outside.

173
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Go one by one.
- Yes.

174
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,920
'Adult Literacy Class.'

175
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Greetings, sir!
- Greetings, sir!

176
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,720
Greetings!

177
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,520
Sorry. I got a little late today.

178
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Next week, we will start
the class on time.

179
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,840
Where are Sada Bhau and his people?

180
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,960
Right over there.

181
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,320
Hello!
- Hello! Have your food.

182
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,640
Sir, are you retiring?
Are you retiring?

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,120
Yeah. That's what they tell me.

184
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,080
Dear, you are a woman,
how can you divorce your husband?

185
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,040
It's not easy to survive
without a husband

186
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
with three daughters
in this day and age.

187
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,400
As a brother, I took
care of your mother until now.

188
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,080
I have tried to reason with her,
but she just doesn't get it.

189
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,320
I will not return home.

190
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,760
How to make you understand?
I just don't know.

191
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,280
Give me booze for 20 rupees.
- Give him the stuff.

192
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,960
Money first, my man.
Before you get zonked and die.

193
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,840
There you go.

194
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,320
Here.

195
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
Drink it up and get going.

196
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,680
Did you drink the whole bottle?

197
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,200
What are you doing, guys?

198
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,920
And...
- Yes?

199
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,360
Will call you in a bit.

200
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,400
It's time to play
and you are still sitting here?

201
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,760
Lazy buggers!
On your mobiles and stuff. Go play!

202
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,480
Come on, hand them a ball.
- Go.

203
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,960
That's all right, carry on, play.

204
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,120
Take this.
- Fifty bucks. A hundred.

205
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,360
Is he leaving or not? Hey!

206
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
Last time, you paid less.
- Do it, for all times sake.

207
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,120
Look at this piece.

208
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,480
This is a good one.

209
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,880
It's broken.
So what? It'll sell all right.

210
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,440
Show him your piece.

211
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,000
Give me what you brought.

212
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,720
This one's solid! Brand new.
- All right, pay right for this one.

213
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,640
I got it yesterday. Brand new!

214
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,720
It's starting to rain.
- Fine.

215
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,200
I want to take any one.
- Pick it up.

216
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,960
Pack up! Pack up!

217
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,560
We'll seal the deal later.
- 17 cell phones.

218
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,520
S**t! This damned rain!

219
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,880
Mama, come quick.

220
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,080
No, my dear. Come.

221
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,840
Two minutes.

222
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,400
We are home.

223
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,720
Go. Go home.

224
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,720
Hey! Come on. Catch him.

225
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,840
You are kicking the ball alone.
Where are you going with it?

226
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,000
Sai!
- Give it to me.

227
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Bring 'beedi' from uncle.
- Bittu.

228
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,560
Give it to me.
- Hey! give it to me. Give me.

229
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,120
What are you doing?
Are you stoned?

230
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,640
Madam.

231
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
Madam, may I get some money?

232
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:40,760
"If I get separated from you
then I will get lost."

233
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:50,240
"Because it's you. It's you.
You are my life."

234
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,160
'Friends Band Numero 1.'

235
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,920
Hello!

236
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,880
Where are the guys?
The kids. Where are they?

237
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,840
Good riddance. Must be out busy
killing or getting killed.

238
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,280
They have turned this into
a booze parlour.

239
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,560
Here?

240
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,560
You want some stuff, yeah?
Weed?

241
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
Hey Sajan!

242
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
He wants stuff.
- No.

243
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,800
No. No. No.

244
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,040
Give him stuff.
- No.

245
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
No, no.
I don't want Sajan... weed.

246
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,680
Have some.
- No. I don't want Sajan.

247
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,120
Never mind, thank you.

248
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,360
You didn't go?
- No, on my way.

249
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,440
And then I'll be back.

250
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,680
Any problem?

251
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,880
No problem. None at all.

252
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,000
"Feast, drink, to wash you clean,
we are here this wild horde."

253
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,560
"Living it king-size, don't give
a flying, this horde is chill!"

254
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,080
"Hard currency, no lose change."

255
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,520
"Can do a litre,
why bother with a quarter?"

256
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,880
"What's there to fear,
feels like a curfew"

257
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,680
"like when India's locked down?"

258
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,240
"Fate's a bitch, she has bitten us,
yet this horde is hotter than fire!"

259
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:42,160
"They see us all right,
yet they make us unseen, invisible."

260
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,760
"We were neither
alive nor do we die."

261
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,000
"For them, we'll be a wild horde."

262
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,760
"No one mourns the living dead."

263
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,520
"We have nothing,
so what do we lose?"

264
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,040
"Our slums are in gutters,
but filth dwells in your hearts."

265
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
"Sick of the gutter
and of public's twitter"

266
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,640
"this horde has risen
and is out on them streets."

267
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,680
Get down quick.
Right now, get out.

268
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,120
You scumbag, piece of s**t.

269
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,760
"They are s**t scared
and now give us a wide berth."

270
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,520
"For we are a horde.
A horde of lions!"

271
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,240
Sit down! Down. Now!
- Don't glare!

272
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,080
No! No! No!
- Hey!

273
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,040
Hey! Can't you understand?

274
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,880
He hit me, that four-eyes!

275
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,880
Tell me your name.
- Tell me your name.

276
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,320
Don.

277
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,640
Don what?

278
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,160
Don Masram.

279
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Age?

280
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,080
What about you, Mowgli?
- Yes, sir?

281
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,280
Your name, you, moron!
- Angel!

282
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
You couldn't tell me first?

283
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,080
Whatever you wanna do,
tell me first.

284
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Sure thing.

285
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,800
There you go. Go on, deal.

286
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,600
Give me 20 rupees.
Imran, give me a 'bidi'.

287
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,600
Eat, you bastard!
Your pop paid for this!

288
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,600
Bugger off, you piece of s**t.

289
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,680
Why are you hitting me?
- Get lost, you son of...

290
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,640
Imran, give me the 20 from before.

291
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,800
Give it to me.

292
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,360
No, this is your daily crap.

293
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,480
Wait...
- Shut up, you drug addict.

294
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,240
Don't hit me, I am telling you.

295
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,320
Don't come from tomorrow.

296
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,480
Stop yapping, okay!

297
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,640
You wanna play football?

298
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Hey!

299
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,160
You play football
and I'll pay you.

300
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,440
How much?

301
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,120
You'll really pay?
- Yep.

302
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,000
Play a match amongst you guys.
Half an hour. I'll pay 500 bucks.

303
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,320
What's the guarantee?

304
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,240
What's the need for a guarantee?

305
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,280
Old man's gone bonkers.

306
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,160
You play and I pay.
- What's the old geezer saying?

307
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,560
Show me the money.

308
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,120
Look, don't cheat.
Otherwise, you know us.

309
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,040
Nope, I won't cheat.

310
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,280
Get going, you lowly beings!

311
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,120
Come on.
- Sachin.

312
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,920
Ankit. Gacchya. Come.

313
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,400
What's happening?
- Just do what I tell you.

314
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,520
Hey! A drug addict.

315
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,520
It's your father.

316
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,040
Look at his antics.

317
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,080
Hey! Give me the ball.
- Babu.

318
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,600
Give me the ball.

319
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,400
Give me. Give me the ball.
- Hey, 'beedi'.

320
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,280
Get rid of your fag, Imran.
- Give it to me.

321
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,320
Pass me the ball.
I stand here like a fool.

322
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,440
Hey!

323
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,480
I will slap you.

324
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,360
Hey! Catch.

325
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,520
Hey! You! Give me the ball.

326
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,400
Sticking to the ball like
a lizard on a wall passes it!

327
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,680
Hey! Give me.
- Move him aside.

328
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,360
Someone get rid of this drunk junk.

329
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,280
Did you give a ball to these morons?
- Just play.

330
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,600
Like giving a computer
to a monkey.

331
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,440
Go there.
- Get the ball.

332
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,080
We'll get 500 for it. Hurry.
- Come on.

333
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,360
Throw away the fag! There you are.

334
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,640
Hey! Quit the 'beedi', you addict.

335
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,800
Will you?
- Look.

336
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,320
Move aside.

337
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,240
No water to wash with and
you want a damn soap, yeah?

338
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,560
Hey! Don't leave it.

339
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,840
What's this new crap?

340
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,560
Hey! You!

341
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,560
Hey, pee face!
- Watch where you are going.

342
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,040
Play right. Don't dare piss me off.

343
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,880
What's wrong? Just play.

344
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,240
Chatter when playing.

345
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,120
He made us run like dogs,
made us slog like s**t.

346
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,880
You asked for the money yet?
- Jerry is on it.

347
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,440
That's 500.

348
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,800
Tomorrow at 6.

349
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,720
You'll pay tomorrow too?
- Yes, I will.

350
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,360
Six sharp.
- Fine.

351
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,240
Come, Mom is calling you.

352
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,880
Got 500.

353
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,880
Crazy old nut! He actually paid up.

354
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,960
Don, there's my plate.

355
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,080
Don, how's the 'biryani'?
- Uncle.

356
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,080
You're not eating, drunk skunk?

357
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,320
My father has drunk his liver away.

358
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,200
Can't save anything
due to his medicines.

359
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,600
Savings are squat.

360
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,280
We need to do something big.

361
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,280
Babu, are you done?

362
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,520
Hold on, work in progress.

363
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Come fast.

364
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,160
Low flow, takes time to empty.
Don't rush me.

365
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,840
Tap my shoulder.
Don't waste time.

366
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,640
Lazaree, come on.

367
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,520
There comes the ma'am.

368
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,200
You lucky bastard.

369
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,960
First thing in the morning.

370
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,640
His heart's pumping
and breath's gasping.

371
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,160
What are you doing?
- Oh s**t! I am scared!

372
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
What are you doing here?
- Hey you!

373
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,560
Give me your hand and pull me up.
- Hey!

374
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,720
What are you doing?

375
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,680
Get out of here!

376
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,520
You'll hit us with this stick?
Where's your AK-47?

377
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,880
You making fun of me?
- What?

378
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,840
Making fun of me?
- Hey! Go.

379
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,160
Move out. Move out.

380
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,160
This guy was in international
security before.

381
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
He is a terror.

382
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
Shall I come?

383
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Really?

384
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,080
Stop being a pest and
get away from here.

385
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,720
Do you know who I am?

386
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,280
Beat it, man.

387
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,880
I will complain.
- Go away.

388
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,800
Get lost. Or we'll make you wear
a bomb jacket and blow you up.

389
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,360
Come on, move.

390
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,760
We don't care what you do.

391
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,360
Go. We can take
on three of you together.

392
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,880
We'll be here daily.
To visit our sister-in-law.

393
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,720
Bhavana ma'am.
Look, there she is.

394
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
Listen, Bhavana ma'am!

395
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,520
Run! She's looking at us.

396
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,720
None of your damn business.
Okay, remember that!

397
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Drugs ruin the whole life.
- Throw this garbage there.

398
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,680
We do drugs with our own money.

399
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,440
And this scale of yours,
put it over there.

400
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,960
Move!
- Hey uncle, don't push me.

401
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,160
Don't 'uncle' me, son.

402
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,560
Get away from it.

403
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,360
Don't mess with my stuff.
- Let me set my cart there.

404
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Keep two rocks over here
and two over there.

405
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,240
I'm not going to sell,
will bring them back.

406
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,160
Babu, come here. Hold the ball.

407
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Where do I stick these?
- In here. Get one more from there.

408
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,080
Get a tin container.

409
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,280
Sachin, you are the goalie there.

410
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,320
And Vishakha, you are here.

411
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,160
No one can touch
the ball except for a goalie.

412
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,800
Vishakha, you can touch it.

413
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,720
Hey! Play. Take this.

414
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,360
This team hits there.
Don't let them have the ball.

415
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,440
Hey!

416
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,840
Play with your own team.

417
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,680
Hey, you!
- Hey Sachin!

418
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,440
Hey!
- Give it to me.

419
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,840
Get them to hit here.

420
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,400
This way here.

421
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,040
Pass it Jerry.
- Come on!

422
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
Take it there.

423
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,720
Run. Pass it to me!

424
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,440
Who did you pass the ball to?
- He told me, so I passed.

425
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,440
He asked, you passed
and he scored a goal on us!

426
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,680
Why did you score on him?
- They asked for it.

427
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,480
But he's not on your team!
He is from the other team.

428
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,920
This is one team, this is other.

429
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,640
This team is wearing shirts.
Take off your shirts.

430
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,960
Shirt. Yes, remove your shirt.

431
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,040
Let's have the ball.
Go play!

432
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,480
There. Hit it there.

433
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,400
Hey! Take this.

434
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,160
Give the ball fast.
- Give.

435
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,280
Aim it.
- Wow! Good shot.

436
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,080
No hand to the ball!

437
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,400
Remember your teams.

438
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,080
Yes.
- You are the Captain.

439
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
Here you are. 500.

440
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,400
Tomorrow at 6.

441
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,840
You don't have money
for your children.

442
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,840
You have loads for social service!

443
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,000
Arjun, I have told you many times.
Manage your expenses.

444
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
You are more than an adult now.

445
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,560
That's right.
I am the only adult here.

446
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,560
You go ahead and spend your
life savings on random strangers.

447
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,440
Double or nothing.

448
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,760
What's the time?

449
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,920
Four o' clock, bro.

450
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,840
Where are you going, bro?
- Whereto?

451
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,160
Finish the game.

452
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,040
I'll be back.

453
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,600
Move it!

454
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,000
Move! Get out of here. Get rid
of this skunk! He can't play.

455
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,680
Hey! Come here.
- Shall I come?

456
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,600
Your kinky stuff!
- What kinky stuff!

457
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,440
What?
- How are you playing?

458
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,840
I am playing the way I want to.

459
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,920
Hey! Leave.

460
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,560
Give me the ball.

461
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Hey, you!

462
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,720
Hey! Play nicely.

463
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,800
Get this moron out of the way
or he'll get killed!

464
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,960
You in a hurry to be killed?
- What the hell did you say?

465
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,320
Why are you acting smart?
- Hey!

466
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,520
Hold it! Back off

467
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,680
What's wrong?
- He's being a jerk.

468
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,000
No fighting! Hey! Give me the ball.
- He is acting smart...

469
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,040
Give me ball.

470
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,880
I have been watching him.
- Just stay quiet!

471
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,000
They'll drive the old man mad.

472
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,800
Sir, he is acting smart for
no reason.

473
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,160
No fighting, please. Stop it.

474
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,680
It's okay.
It's over. Let it go.

475
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,160
I will deal with you later.
- Enough. Okay. Ready.

476
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,960
Ready. Start.

477
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
'Okay, bye.'

478
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
'What took you so long?'

479
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,040
'What could I do?
He wasn't leaving.'

480
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,640
'And kids?'

481
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,200
'Kids?
They went to play football.'

482
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,400
'They won't be back, yeah?'

483
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,960
'No. They won't come.
They went to play football.'

484
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,720
You are done.

485
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,000
Foul, foul.

486
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,200
Babu, what are you doing?
Come quickly to play!

487
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,880
I don't play with cans.

488
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,640
Let the old geezer bring the ball
and I'll play.

489
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,000
Come quick.
- Let me brush my teeth.

490
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,520
Could you not stay
for some more time?

491
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,800
Ticket prices will go up, Mom.

492
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,040
Arjun, you are too rude sometimes.

493
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,040
Leave after
your father's retirement program.

494
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,400
You could've booked a ticket
for days later...

495
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,720
I need to go.

496
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,640
Wait. Wait.

497
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,480
Where are you going? Go back.

498
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,880
We are here to meet Sir.
- Which Sir?

499
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,160
We want to meet Vijay sir.
- Wait.

500
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,600
We are here to meet your Big Daddy.
Let us through, Hakka noodle.

501
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,440
No. No.
- Vijay sir.

502
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,600
Sir!

503
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,800
Let them through.

504
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,240
Move! Keep quiet.
- Move away.

505
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,400
I would've beaten him up.
- Look at the chick.

506
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,240
That is Sara.

507
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,680
Sister-in-law is with them.

508
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,880
Don't say anything now. Sir is here!

509
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,920
What sir, you didn't come there?
- Where?

510
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,320
We've been waiting
for you to play.

511
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,160
Yeah, I was a little busy.
I'll come over in the evening.

512
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,520
Stick to your word, alright?
- Sure.

513
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,440
Go away!

514
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,120
Alright, sir,
see you in the evening.

515
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,040
See you.

516
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,080
Alright, sir.
- Sir, I will see you.

517
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,280
As you wish, bro.

518
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,240
Mr. Borade.
- Yes.

519
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,520
What are you doing
with these guys?

520
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,800
I play football with them.
They are good.

521
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,360
You should not mix with such people.

522
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
They play well? Really?

523
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,360
They trespass our stadium.
Stalk girls and do drugs.

524
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,560
What can they play?

525
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,280
See, don't be
so judgmental about them.

526
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,240
I know what you are saying.

527
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,720
But they are not bad kids.

528
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,440
They can give
a tough fight to our team.

529
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,440
Tough fight?

530
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,040
If they can be civil for one even
minute, I will do whatever you say.

531
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,920
They are like a dog's tail
- Bhavana ma'am!

532
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,480
There you go.

533
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,280
Idiot.

534
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,480
Stupid.

535
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,520
Babu, can you steal and sell it?
- How much can you get for a dog?

536
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,360
Will you keep quiet?

537
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,400
Go, you go.

538
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,240
You go.
You are such a big don, no?

539
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,040
Go. Go.

540
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,040
Anybody home?

541
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,680
Will you open the door today?

542
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,120
Uncle!
- You taking us for a ride or what!

543
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,240
You said you'd come and you are
sitting here enjoying tea and all.

544
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,000
We have sitting on our
behinds all day, waiting on you!

545
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,240
You think we are dumb or what?

546
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,400
No, I won't be able to come today.
There's a small problem.

547
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,520
The thing is...

548
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,800
I don't have money
to give you, guys.

549
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,240
Are you pulling our leg?

550
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,360
You live in such a big house and you
don't have 500 rupees for us?

551
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,040
Look in the sugar jar.

552
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,440
Yes?
- Check the sugar box too.

553
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,600
I looked already. Nothing there.
- Under the mattress then.

554
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,800
Mattress checked. Nothing.

555
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,560
Yeah right!
We have stupid written over us.

556
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,680
Checked all corners. Nothing.
- Do something, man!

557
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,080
No. No, I don't have money.
- Sir. Sir.

558
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,600
We'll play now. You pay later.
Consider it a loan on you.

559
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,240
Come there.
- No...

560
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,920
No, I don't do loans.
- What is this?

561
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,440
I don't do loans.
- Sir, no.

562
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,200
What is this?
- What about the money?

563
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,840
What?

564
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,640
Sir, give us the ball.

565
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,480
I don't have money.

566
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,920
Never mind the money.
Just give us the ball.

567
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,040
We'll play and return.

568
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,920
I'll take it on my risk.
I'll bring it back.

569
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,520
Hey! Hey!

570
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,200
Hey! Come on.

571
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,600
Listen.

572
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,240
I want our slum team

573
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,840
to play a goodwill 'good Bhavana'
match with my college team.

574
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,200
What's with this 'Bhavana'?

575
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,320
Oh that's nothing.

576
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,360
We just play a friendship match.

577
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,120
But I want that our slum team

578
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,080
to defeat the college team.

579
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,480
To beat them, we need to practice.

580
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,200
We should have goodwill
with Bhavana, yes.

581
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,400
Of course, you want to!

582
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,320
Goodwill with Bhavana!

583
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,720
Good.

584
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,600
Nice.

585
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,440
Come, Babu. Very good.

586
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,680
One, two. One, two. One, two.

587
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,760
Good.

588
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,560
Stay in the square.
Don't touch the stick.

589
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,240
"Why do you curse
this empty starkness?"

590
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,800
Do it as fast as you can.

591
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,120
Vishakha. Wow! Very good.

592
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,920
"Make friends with life,
there's a way out of this darkness."

593
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,760
You have to cross it and go.
Yes.

594
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,360
"Far away from the clouds."

595
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,880
Karthik, will you hit it?

596
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,040
Ready? Wow! Good.

597
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:02,400
"We all need to live."

598
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,560
"So find a reason to be alive."

599
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:19,000
"If not ashore
then find a twig at least."

600
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,280
"You are here."

601
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Come on. Pass it, Don.

602
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,040
Come here. How can you go alone

603
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,000
and hit a goal?

604
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,120
Your team members are there,
pass it to them.

605
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,760
Hey, Babu. Come here.
- What is it?

606
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,960
Why do you put your
hands on the ball?

607
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,040
It just happens,
what's the big deal?

608
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,160
No, you can't do that.

609
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,120
It's a foul, if you touch it.

610
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,680
I'll tie your hands behind you.
- No need. I'll try not to touch.

611
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,840
Okay? Don't touch it.
- Okay.

612
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,520
Need more speed. Right till the end.

613
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,800
Who's the old geezer messing
with the kids?

614
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,560
I can't even begin to tell you.

615
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,040
Yeah!

616
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,200
Hey!

617
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,440
Amazing!

618
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
Sir, can I say something?
- Go ahead.

619
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,360
First time in life
starters without booze!

620
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,160
Do you drink?
- Give it to me.

621
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,600
Sir, you drink?

622
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,640
I quit.
- Why so?

623
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,800
No fun anymore. It's bad for you.

624
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,320
Have some more, Sir.
- Damn tasty.

625
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,440
You were right.
- The 'chiwda' spoiled the fun.

626
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,040
Really is tasty.
- Onion makes it work.

627
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,120
Hey!

628
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,880
Are you here to play football?

629
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,960
What were you doing?
- Working. Sorry, sir.

630
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,760
I was passing time, sir.
- As if.

631
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,400
Do your job properly.
Hand me that ball.

632
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,480
Get back to work.
- Okay, sir.

633
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,000
Please don't waste
your time and health.

634
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,000
Take care.

635
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,080
Take care.
- Call me when you reach, brother.

636
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,160
Butler,
do you pray to God and all that?

637
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,960
Or just fly high on grass?

638
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,280
What's up, Hitler Bhai?

639
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,600
What?

640
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,440
Contribution for our
Babasaheb's birth anniversary?

641
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,400
Should I?

642
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,360
Not much.
These bastards are flying too high.

643
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Hold it.

644
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,080
Alright?

645
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,720
That's all?

646
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,560
You want the whole thing yeah, son?
- He wants to give more.

647
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,600
He'll even pull his heart out.
- May I or you want to talk crap?

648
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,280
Happy? Nah, I don't need a receipt.
Give it to someone else.

649
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,720
Just have a talk with your guy.
He's got a big mouth.

650
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,280
Okay Hitler-bhai. Hail Bhim.
- Hail Bhim

651
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,440
He always makes excuses. Never pays.
- Why don't you contribute?

652
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,640
Whether it's Babasaheb's

653
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,560
or any other great person's
birth anniversary,

654
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,200
I don't believe in dancing
to loud music.

655
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,520
If you do something beneficial
for the slum, I'll contribute.

656
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,120
We'll do that too.
Contribute willingly.

657
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
I am sorry, but no...

658
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,680
Leave it. He won't.
Let's go.

659
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,160
Look, Mr. Borade.

660
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,920
It's better you don't bring this
filth inside the college campus.

661
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,080
Sir, nothing will happen that
spoils the college reputation.

662
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,080
Consider this my retirement gift
if you wish.

663
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,160
Look, you have bet 5000 rupees.
- I know.

664
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,840
Don't go back on your word.
You are known for that.

665
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,760
It won't be necessary this time.

666
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,880
Your horde of junkies
won't even last for ten minutes.

667
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,640
Forget about winning.

668
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,760
Not a horde, sir! Call it a Team.

669
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
Same difference. A horde... team.

670
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,720
Still a team of junkies, right?

671
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,520
You're far better than them,
but don't play casually.

672
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,480
Yes, sir.

673
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,720
More the goals, the better for us.
At least 10-0. How much?

674
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,760
Ten- Zero.

675
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,840
Louder!
- 10-0.

676
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,240
What is it?

677
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,240
Let's go inside.
- Where?

678
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Let's go inside.
- Our slum's match.

679
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,080
Who told you about a match?

680
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,240
They told us.

681
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,680
No no, back off.

682
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,200
Let us go.
- No, go back.

683
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,240
Don't touch here.

684
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,640
It's Sunday. College is closed.

685
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,880
Go back.
- Go back to your slum.

686
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,640
We will go anywhere,
that's none of your business

687
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,960
Don't come back.

688
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,200
Come.

689
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,240
Your horde... team is not here yet?
- No, they'll be here.

690
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,000
Scared, are they?
- No, surely they'll be here.

691
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,240
They'll be here.
- Sir.

692
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,400
The Slum team!
- There they are.

693
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,840
What's all this?
You'll play football in this getup?

694
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,480
College match for the first time.
- So what?

695
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,400
So we dressed up.

696
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,800
Man! We'll play okay, sir.

697
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,640
Who are they?

698
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,120
People from the slum,
they're with us.

699
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,520
Whoever scores a goal, gets a prize.

700
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,200
Sir, if you could get
the gate opened.

701
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,120
Which one?

702
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,480
That gate.
- What for?

703
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,160
There are some people from the slum.
- So?

704
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,840
Sir, we need cheerleaders
and the works too.

705
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,160
You want cheerleaders?
- Yes, sir.

706
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,600
Tell them to open it.
- Hey! You open it. Sir said okay.

707
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,080
Open it.

708
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,360
Don't see the sister-in-law
- Yeah, man. I am here just for her.

709
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,160
It's Sunday, stupid.

710
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,840
She is from a rich family.
Will get up late, won't she?

711
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,280
She'll be her, surely.

712
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,360
You are the captain.
- Yes.

713
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,280
Be a fair referee.

714
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,560
Come on, get ready. Come, sir.

715
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,840
Hey, Don. Sister-in-law is here!

716
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,800
Hot, isn't she?

717
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Focus there! Don't look at the babe.
They'll score a goal.

718
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,240
Looks smashing!

719
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,760
Don's heart is pumping
and lungs are gasping!

720
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,000
Ready? Keeper ready?
- He's ready since he was a baby.

721
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,760
Kali, bend.

722
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,040
Stop him. Stop!

723
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,160
Oh my!

724
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,640
Why are you playing like a girl?

725
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,160
You are all there!
What can I do alone here?

726
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,200
What do you mean alone?

727
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,160
Your Pop will play defence or what?

728
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,160
Babu, what are you doing there?
Come here for defence.

729
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,840
He is dancing even
before the ball comes.

730
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,840
You just better go home.

731
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,120
You are catching fish or what?
Shall I go in your place?

732
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,800
Never mind. Block well now.

733
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,760
You came for your father's wedding,
dressed up like that?

734
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,640
Let Sachin stand instead.

735
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,280
You look like a bull, you pig.

736
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,560
Stop the goal or
I'll send you home.

737
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,840
Babu. Hey, Babu.
- Give me.

738
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,080
Hey!
- Hey!

739
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,000
Pass me the ball.
- Pass.

740
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,440
Hey! Come on.

741
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,480
Why are you hitting it?

742
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,120
Come here.

743
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,240
What happened?

744
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,240
Tell him or I'll kill him.

745
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,920
The goal was wide open!

746
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,400
I just missed or
it was a clean goal.

747
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,400
Why did you hit the ball
into our goalpost?

748
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,640
I want to cuss you so much.
I'm holding back due to the censor!

749
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,800
I'll send all your family away!
- Do you want to play?

750
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,040
Why did you kick the ball out?

751
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,400
Hey!
- You!

752
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,680
Why are you all fighting here?

753
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,880
Catch it.
- Hey! Catch it.

754
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,640
What is happening today?

755
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,200
Good goal!

756
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,680
What did I do?

757
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,200
Why me? I did nothing. Stop!

758
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,760
It's him. It's him.

759
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,480
It's happening due to him.
They are hitting goals.

760
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,960
Good goal.

761
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,280
I tried, right?

762
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,120
Look at your horde.

763
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,880
Come on, guys!
- Come on!

764
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,320
Hey!

765
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,880
Why are you whistling for no reason?
Is there treasure buried here?

766
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,160
It's a free kick.

767
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,040
Okay, kick away.
- Come on.

768
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,400
Line it up, boss.

769
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,080
Will he make a goal?

770
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,960
Nope! We are like a wall here.
No way he can make a goal.

771
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,280
Where's she?

772
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,840
You call this a goodwill match?
This is a sad will match.

773
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,520
Goal after goal.

774
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,160
What an ass you are?
You catching pigeons or something?

775
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,400
Hip, hip!
- Hurray!

776
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,520
Hip, hip!
- Hurray!

777
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,080
The score has to be 10-0.
How much?

778
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,080
We need 10-0.
- Yes.

779
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,600
Attack is the best
policy of defence.

780
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,240
Showing off your English?

781
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,840
I say, we must attack. The attack is
the best policy of defence.

782
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,480
So we break into their homes
and beat them?

783
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,320
That's what I was saying.

784
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,560
Angel and Jerry in.

785
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,160
Go on, you two.
Save the slum's image.

786
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,240
The rest can't do anything.

787
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,360
I am sending two black shirts.

788
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,680
If you do well, then I will
give you two black shirts.

789
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,400
There she is.

790
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,200
You are dead meat now.

791
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,280
Sister-in-law's going to kick ass.

792
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,640
We'll need to lose now, what say?

793
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,000
Like we were winning!

794
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,720
Now we only attack.

795
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,120
Here.

796
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
Hey!

797
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,840
Hey! Jerry!

798
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,480
Jerry!
- Jerry!

799
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,000
Come on. Ankush.

800
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,760
Ali. Catch him.

801
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,760
What do you have buried there?

802
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,560
Don. Don.
- Ali, catch him.

803
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,760
Oh my!

804
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,600
Very nice.
- Don, nice!

805
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,200
Well done! Don, great job.

806
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,160
Come on.
- Well done, Don.

807
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,160
Well done, Don.

808
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,400
Hit.

809
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,160
Oh my!
- Yogi!

810
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,200
Where did he go?

811
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,720
Where's our guy!
- Look there.

812
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,880
What is he doing?

813
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,440
What are you doing, Yogesh?
- He's the one who said attack.

814
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,400
What attack?

815
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,760
You told me to attack.

816
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,320
Fool!
- He told me to attack.

817
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,920
Who told you?
- Babu.

818
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,440
Fool! You are a goalkeeper.
You'll be here or entering there?

819
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,200
You are just confusing me now.

820
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,360
Reduce the use of English.

821
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,080
Four shots. Tell me about it.

822
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,280
You are defending.
You have to save the goal.

823
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,640
You must not go there.
- There are 15 people out there.

824
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,800
Will your old man this post?

825
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,280
Yes?

826
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,160
He wouldn't have
saved it anyway.

827
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,320
This has happened due to you,
you know?

828
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,280
You fool! Handling the ball!
- How many goals did they score?

829
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,640
It would have been a goal anyway.

830
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,280
Useless goalie! You can't
even stop a girl's kick.

831
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,000
Look how happy you are!

832
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
What are you doing?
- Did you see that?

833
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,080
How many goals did I say?

834
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,040
10-0.

835
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,080
Didn't say I 10?

836
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,240
How many did you score? Five!

837
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,920
Only five goals in the first half
against these slum guys!

838
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,640
Let a girl score over him!
- Get here all of you.

839
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,880
Babu, do you know that
you are not playing well.

840
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,760
Shame on, you guys!
You should be crushing such people.

841
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,120
You should have already scored
10 goals in the first half.

842
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,760
These are not football players.
We are proper players.

843
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,480
Guys, what are you doing?

844
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,680
You came to play football
or attending a wedding?

845
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,920
Just look at you!

846
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,440
Wearing shades! Take it off, Babu.
Lose those boots.

847
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,720
Take it off.

848
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,160
Are these sports shoes?

849
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,320
I trained you so much.

850
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,520
They taunt you and mock
you all the time. Bloody slumdogs.

851
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,840
How will they play football?

852
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,240
You're proving them right.

853
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,200
This is what I feel bad about.

854
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,440
Because I know
you are better than this.

855
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,560
You have brought us shame.
I feel really sorry.

856
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,160
We can win it.

857
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,400
We can win easily.
In the second half.

858
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,040
We'll rock it.
- All of them are junkies.

859
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,200
Hip, hip!
- Hurray!

860
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,600
Come on.

861
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,400
Spread out. Spread out, Babu.

862
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,640
Hey!
- Deva.

863
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,640
Angel.

864
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,800
Take it.
- Come back.

865
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,400
Talent!

866
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,800
Ball!

867
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,840
Babu!
- Jerry!

868
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,840
Get back! Back! Now!

869
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,560
Jerry!

870
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,240
Jerry!

871
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,920
Yes! Very good.

872
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,880
Great goal!

873
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,360
And now it begins!
I am alive again.

874
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,600
Get it here again.

875
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,960
Don! Give me, Don.

876
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,760
Don, leave it.
- Ankush.

877
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,400
Forward. Move it.

878
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,480
Don!
- Angel!

879
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,760
Ali!

880
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,000
Give me.
- Angel.

881
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,600
Take it easy, my boy!

882
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,240
Angel!

883
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,840
Angel!

884
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,080
Pass it gently.

885
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,800
Don!

886
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,480
Don! Forward.

887
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,000
Don will win!

888
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,280
Yay!

889
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,680
Run.

890
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,920
Hey! Give me.

891
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,320
Hey!
- Oh no!

892
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,920
Aman, catch it. Good!
- Well done!

893
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,280
Jerry!
- Jerry, move ahead.

894
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,800
Jerry!

895
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,000
Try it.

896
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,480
Yes!

897
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,920
We made a goal!

898
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,560
"I am dancing."

899
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,520
Hey!

900
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,240
Paaji!

901
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,440
Well played.
- Paaji!

902
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,480
Jerry, come. Fast.

903
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,680
Oh! Well done.

904
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,440
There you are.

905
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,160
Jerry!

906
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,320
Sophia!

907
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,360
Goal!

908
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,600
Yes!

909
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,440
Rajesh!

910
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,760
Use your brain.

911
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,680
Hey! Pass it to me.
- Take it behind.

912
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Hey!
- Babu!

913
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,840
Babu!
- Take it.

914
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,080
Come on.

915
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,720
Ankit!

916
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
Take it.

917
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,040
Ankit.

918
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,000
Take it.
- Hit it in.

919
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,160
Play.
- Come on!

920
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,120
Jerry, try it.

921
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,640
Goal!
- Yes!

922
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,160
Kinky business! Kinky business!

923
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,240
Kinky business! Kinky business!

924
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,160
Kinky business! Kinky business!

925
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,880
Kinky business! Kinky business!

926
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,600
Kinky business! Kinky business!

927
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,520
Come on, Jerry!

928
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,520
He is taking it alone!

929
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,040
Defence!

930
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,160
Ready!

931
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,960
What are you doing?

932
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,240
Stop him!

933
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,720
Ali!
- Shoot.

934
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,760
Kick it!

935
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,400
Well done! Well played!

936
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,520
Now listen to me.

937
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,640
It's not over yet. Still, five
minutes to go. Come on, come on.

938
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,320
Come on.
- Sir.

939
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,200
This is wrong.

940
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,960
Yes! Ali!

941
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,240
Babu! There! In the defence.

942
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,960
In defence.
- Five minutes to go.

943
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,480
Angel. Angel.

944
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,880
Are you tired?

945
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,640
Five minutes left. One more goal!

946
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,080
One more goal!

947
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,720
Snatch.
- Take it.

948
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,920
Tackle him!
- Come back. Come back.

949
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,240
Rohan.
- Clear it.

950
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,200
Move ahead.

951
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,960
Take it out.

952
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,560
Don! Pass it.

953
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,160
Don!

954
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,680
We are here, we have no fear.

955
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,480
Take action. We got it. Leave it.

956
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,920
Down, down, down!

957
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,520
Imran, go.

958
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,800
Anand.
- Don!

959
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,720
Hit the corner.

960
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,720
Let's go out and come back again.

961
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,120
Now what? What's next?

962
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,680
Now. Penalty.
- What?

963
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,480
Penalty.
- Means?

964
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,440
Slum team and college team get
to shoot five goals each.

965
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,160
And what if they
score four goals?

966
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,040
Then the slum team will lose.

967
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,880
Okay.
- Yes.

968
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,760
Keeper, ready?

969
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,640
Striker, ready?
- You have to save this one.

970
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,400
Don't let it get saved.

971
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,080
Paaji!

972
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,480
Who want to bet?

973
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,440
10 to 1.

974
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,280
Betting real dough! Don't worry.

975
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,440
Check the angle and shoot.

976
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,520
Lost my money. Damn!

977
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:02,160
St. Johns, 1.
Gaddi Godam, 0.

978
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,960
Adarsh.

979
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,560
What it this nonsense?

980
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,360
St Johns, 2.
Gaddi Godam, 0.

981
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,680
Paaji! You did well.
- Well done!

982
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,960
Come on.

983
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,240
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

984
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,840
Hey! Paaji!

985
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,800
Now the goodwill shall increase.

986
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,680
Adarsh.

987
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,560
Don't let them score a goal.

988
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,720
Bless my soul!

989
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,360
We got saved.

990
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,240
One more.
- Who is this?

991
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,520
St. Johns, 2.
Gaddi Godam, 1.

992
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,800
Come on, Paaji. Save it, please.

993
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,200
Paaji, save it. Paaji.

994
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,200
Keeper ready? Striker ready?

995
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,040
Yay!

996
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,200
Come back. Go back.

997
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,120
Well played.

998
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,440
Get back!

999
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,240
Go back.

1000
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,160
Go back. Okay.

1001
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,680
Everybody, get back.

1002
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,680
Jump up and show again.

1003
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,000
Hey!

1004
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,520
Jerry! Well done, Jerry.

1005
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,880
You can do it, man. You can.
- Come on do it.

1006
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,720
Oh my Lord, Saviour.
Slumdogs for you.

1007
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,000
Slumdogs win forever!

1008
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,160
Loser! Lost it!

1009
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,560
Aman, save the goal, bro!

1010
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,320
St. Johns, 2. Gaddi Godam, 2.

1011
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,480
Yay!

1012
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,360
We all are with you.

1013
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,240
Babu, you go, you'll do it. Okay?
- I am shaking all over.

1014
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,360
Don't worry. Listen to me.
I'll tell you something.

1015
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,120
Adarsh.
- I am telling you...

1016
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,480
He is not at all a good player. You
must stop him. He shouldn't score.

1017
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,480
One minute.

1018
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,520
He must not score a goal.
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,840
All the best!
- Yes, sir.

1020
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,680
Can I do it, Sir?
- Babu, just do it.

1021
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,840
Come on, Babu.

1022
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,920
Keeper, ready? Striker, ready?

1023
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,280
Kinky business!

1024
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,120
Congratulations!

1025
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,080
Congratulations!

1026
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,240
Congratulations!

1027
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,800
Sir, he is Khelchand. Will you
let him join your team, sir?

1028
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,920
Alright, come over, tomorrow.
Okay?

1029
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,400
This is my first time
inside such a huge house.

1030
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,440
You are the first person

1031
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,280
who wants to know me...
who wants to know about me.

1032
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,160
That there is someone...

1033
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,400
It's the first time someone asked me
about myself.

1034
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,000
There is no one like that.

1035
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,800
No one has ever asked, you know.

1036
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:50,440
Like, how's it going?
Are you happy or sad?

1037
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,480
I'll tell you since you asked me.

1038
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,720
Normally if you ask any kid,
he might say...

1039
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,400
I want to be a doctor
when I grow up.

1040
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,280
Maybe fly a helicopter,
ditch it and die whatever, you know.

1041
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,960
My deal was simple.

1042
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,360
This is how it works in Nagpur. You
get jailed for murder, you come out,

1043
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,280
and then your whole life is set.

1044
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,440
That was my goal. One murder.

1045
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,280
Go to jail. I am just a kid.

1046
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,600
Juvenile jail
and I am out in 3-4 months.

1047
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,680
I am not scared of anything,
I can beat up anyone.

1048
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That's how I roll.

1049
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:31,120
But I felt good playing that match.
Hope you'll let me play again.

1050
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,640
That's it. Hail Maharashtra.

1051
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,960
My name is Asma.
I am in third grade.

1052
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,640
I collect scrap metal with friends.

1053
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,520
I am Rihanna, Asma's elder sister.

1054
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,640
I work as a maid
in the big bungalows.

1055
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,240
I also pick scrap metal and plastic.

1056
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:59,160
Sir, my name is Imran Sheikh.
I live with my Mom.

1057
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,080
My old man died when I was a kid.

1058
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,960
Mom works as a maid
and I do odd jobs.

1059
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,280
I often hang out with Don. We've
been friends since we were kids.

1060
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,560
My name is Kartik Ulkey.
I was in 6th grade before.

1061
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,360
I'd play orchestra with my dad.

1062
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,280
Yogesh would play the banjo
and Babu on the drums.

1063
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,760
Sometimes there used to fights
at the orchestra.

1064
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,840
This one time, cops came
and locked me in the bathroom.

1065
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,800
We'd perform near the school,

1066
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,680
and when the teacher
learned about it,

1067
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,320
she asked me to get out
of the school.

1068
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,040
We work in construction.

1069
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:42,400
It's backbreaking, hard work.
You have to dig and carry stuff.

1070
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,840
It makes me damn tired.
Booze does not make me work better.

1071
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,840
It just numbs my body
and my senses.

1072
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,880
We feel there's nothing good
about our lives.

1073
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:58,200
Lots of people tell me
to quit boozing and bad habits.

1074
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:02,280
I simply can't. Lots of
people have told me. I can't quit.

1075
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,520
I've had lots of bad habits.
I even used to do crack.

1076
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:13,280
I used to get high and sit at the
railway station. I'd feel so good.

1077
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,640
I stopped going back home.

1078
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,800
I started stealing,
robbing for drugs.

1079
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,640
I stole rods, iron from trains
in the early hours of midnight.

1080
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:27,040
I was so hooked to crack and all.

1081
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,280
But not anymore. I don't do drugs.
I hate it if someone else does it.

1082
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,760
No human should do drugs ever.
I know what I've been through.

1083
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,440
I don't want anyone
to go through what I did.

1084
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,000
I don't let anyone touch drugs. I
try to explain it to them, you know.

1085
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,440
My name is Ankush Masram.
These guys call me Don.

1086
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:53,400
My story is nothing special.

1087
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,320
Whatever it is same as theirs.

1088
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,000
Nothing special,
these are my friends.

1089
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,320
It's all the same. That's it.

1090
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,000
I lost my dad when I was a kid.

1091
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,320
There was no one else
who could provide for us.

1092
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,320
Except for Mom.

1093
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,360
She's a nurse.

1094
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,880
My Mom gave me some money
and I bought a banjo.

1095
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,520
I always wanted a banjo.
I played a little.

1096
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:31,280
Then I started
playing the flute too.

1097
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,040
Slowly, people started knowing me
that I played well.

1098
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,160
You massage better than you sing.

1099
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:44,960
No, you will never understand.
It is an art.

1100
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,200
I told you already to
book my flight in the morning.

1101
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,920
Hurry!

1102
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,560
Take it up, up!

1103
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,920
Place it there for a while.

1104
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,040
Hail Shivaji!
- Hail Shivaji!

1105
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,160
Hail Bhim!
- Hail Bhim!

1106
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,080
"Mess with us and we bury them
six feet under!"

1107
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,320
"No holds barred, we kick hard."

1108
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,600
"We don't just talk or bark back."

1109
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,960
"If we lose it,
we roar high and loud."

1110
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:57,200
"If they mess with us
or even so much as stare at us."

1111
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:02,880
"We beat the crap out of them,
break some bones and jaws."

1112
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:09,760
"This is how we roll. Curvy
and crooked, twisty and round."

1113
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:17,440
"Curvy and crooked,
twisty and round."

1114
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:56,400
"In this short life,
we've seen crazy stuff."

1115
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:03,080
"Been there and done that is what we
say, so to hell with what come may."

1116
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,520
"What do we need them
fancy big house for?"

1117
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,920
"The streets here are our mansions."

1118
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,160
"The pavements
are soft beds and pillows."

1119
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:16,440
"And the vast sky makes up
for the roof."

1120
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,720
"The world has beat
the crap out of us."

1121
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,400
"They made sure
they scarred us forever."

1122
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:28,360
"Guess what all their crap
has made our bones hard as steel."

1123
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:35,320
"This is how we roll. Curved
and crooked, twisty and round."

1124
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:43,480
"This is how we roll. curved
and crooked, twisty and round."

1125
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:11,960
"We pick some pockets
at times win a lottery."

1126
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:18,760
"At times they put us in jail
in some dark black cell."

1127
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:25,400
"We don't really give a damn
as long as we get what we wish."

1128
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,840
"What did the world offer us?
A big zero!"

1129
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:32,080
"We'll beat them back, like a hero!"

1130
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:38,720
"Bad times rule over us,
but we don't waste our tears."

1131
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,080
"The heart is sure filled
with sorrow."

1132
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,120
"We make sure we laugh
and don't care for tomorrow."

1133
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:51,440
"This is how we roll. Curvy
and crooked, twisty and round."

1134
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:58,640
"This is how we roll. Curvy
and crooked, twisty and round."

1135
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,120
'There are four rules in management
which are very important.'

1136
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,800
'You need to have
a strategic plan.'

1137
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,760
'You need to be focused.'

1138
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,960
'You need to be creative.'

1139
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,720
'And number four.
You need to have a goal.'

1140
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:42,080
Mr. Vijay is retiring today
and that makes me really sad.

1141
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:47,560
He's always restless, full of new
ideas. Always kept us on our toes.

1142
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:51,120
Some people get tired, exhausted,
but Mr. Vijay never gets tired.

1143
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,080
I humbly request you, sir.
Please take it easy now just rest.

1144
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,160
Go on a pilgrimage.

1145
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:01,240
And spend quality time
with your grandchildren.

1146
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,880
I cannot say much more.
Just that I am very sad today.

1147
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,080
Now I request Mr. Vijay
to address the audience.

1148
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,000
Until you mentioned it,

1149
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,440
I never felt that I was retiring

1150
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,120
I had actually forgotten about it.

1151
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,080
So thank you.

1152
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,160
Is that right? That the junk shop
guys have taken over the slum land?

1153
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,400
Who?
- The junkyard people?

1154
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,160
They have.
I checked with the corporation.

1155
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,160
That strip of land is
reserved for sports activities.

1156
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:33,520
If it is for sports you can see
it's now become a junk yard.

1157
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,240
They've spread it but...
- What is it?

1158
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,880
They are slowly
encroaching over all of it.

1159
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,640
They will come.
- What?

1160
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,240
We will see what to do.
- Sir.

1161
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,600
Yogesh just died, fell off a train.
- What?

1162
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,920
He was throwing down coal.
He fell to his death.

1163
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,760
You are kidding, right?
- No, Jerry just called.

1164
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:53,840
He said that it just happened.

1165
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,640
I met him yesterday.
- Don't mess with us.

1166
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,080
Really.

1167
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,840
Yogesh! Yogesh!

1168
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,680
Yogesh!

1169
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:57,960
Look, whatever you
are doing is illegal.

1170
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,120
This is reserved land. For sports.

1171
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,640
How come? I am here legally.

1172
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,760
Legally?
You have your shop here illegally.

1173
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,760
Clean India campaign
just out of the blue!

1174
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,480
It won't work. I won't look at it.
- Listen.

1175
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,120
Here are the court papers. You
need to vacate this land.

1176
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,120
The law is only for you
guys or what? Nothing for us?

1177
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,600
You don't like it, do you?

1178
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,680
That the kids are getting
rid of bad habits.

1179
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,600
Don't bullshit me!
- Hey!

1180
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,120
He won't understand this language.
Have to explain on his own.

1181
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,600
Let's teach him a lesson.

1182
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,960
Pick it up.
- Hey!

1183
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,400
Remove all this thing right now.

1184
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:40,000
I respect the law and stamp or
I would've taught you a lesson.

1185
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,840
Come on, move this.

1186
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,560
What will you do now,
you old geezer?

1187
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:19,160
What's the big deal?
Let's move him over there.

1188
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:24,200
Oh God! Careful guys, it's God.

1189
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,360
If you people are scared,
I'll move Him.

1190
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,480
He won't do anything to me.
- You keep quiet.

1191
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,200
We are giving Him another flat.

1192
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,480
They moved the shop,
house and everything.

1193
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,120
For 17 years,
we've done business here.

1194
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,520
Come on, pick it up.
- Carefully.

1195
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,520
Careful! Very careful with God.
- Handle Him with care.

1196
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,640
That's a sin. Careful.
- Slow and easy.

1197
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,120
I will make my father wear this.

1198
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,120
You are committing a very
big sin. Slowly. Remove it.

1199
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,360
Remove it.

1200
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,440
Why are you uprooting God's statue?
- Don, is it done?

1201
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,760
Hey!

1202
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,800
Hold on, guys.
Getting crazy for football

1203
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,440
'Gaddi Godam Stars.'

1204
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,120
What is that?
- Sir, a plane.

1205
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:29,960
Look, a plane.

1206
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,640
Yes. Very nice!

1207
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,640
Do you know how planes fly?
- No.

1208
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:37,760
Imagine this is a plane
and these are the wings.

1209
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,920
When it runs on land
at a high speed,

1210
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,640
the air loops over the wings.

1211
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,960
It creates a force, a lift

1212
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,680
that flies the plane.

1213
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,880
This also forms an important
principle of life.

1214
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,280
This was science.

1215
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,280
But this is how things work
in life.

1216
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,640
Life means struggle
and struggle lives with life.

1217
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,800
Every single day
means a new struggle.

1218
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:06,720
Only struggling against all odds
can make us fly high.

1219
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:10,240
Right?
- Listen to me, sir.

1220
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,120
What were you saying, Babu?
- Let's play them again.

1221
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,280
A serious one this time.

1222
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,320
Not so soon.

1223
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:23,680
How about Mominpura slum?
- The one on this side?

1224
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,960
Yes. Them.

1225
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,720
Let's play them.

1226
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,600
Let's have a tournament.
It will be good.

1227
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,520
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1228
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,640
Great idea.
- Let's have a tournament!

1229
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,920
It's great if there's a match.
- Good plan.

1230
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:45,520
'Khandelwal, what's going on?
You're taking me for a ride.'

1231
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,760
'I don't know all that.
I need the money now.'

1232
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,440
'Tell me where to come.'

1233
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,440
Vijay.
- Yes, sir.

1234
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,880
What do you wish to prove
by doing all this?

1235
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:02,200
Sir, trust me this tournament

1236
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:07,640
will be the medium for these kids
to express their talent.

1237
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,240
Where's Khandelwal?

1238
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,160
That's it?

1239
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,240
That's all for now.
Rest we'll see later.

1240
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,680
What is this?
You always play the broken record.

1241
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,240
I will be spending some
time with these kids.

1242
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,920
And I can see them change.

1243
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,120
I can see the change coming.

1244
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,200
Just because of football, these kids
are moving away from drugs,

1245
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,320
fights,
hooliganism and violence.

1246
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:51,120
There you are. What's up?
- Nothing just

1247
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,560
Come. Come to the side.
- Where?

1248
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,680
Come to the side.

1249
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:05,320
I hear you,
but I can't believe it.

1250
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,440
Sir, just trust me on this.
You won't regret this.

1251
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,760
Give us the permission, please.
My responsibility.

1252
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,520
Look here.

1253
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,080
Say you are sorry.
- Keep your hands off.

1254
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,080
You want to teach us, do you?

1255
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:29,560
I said sorry, so let it go.
We were both at fault.

1256
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:33,280
I'll give the permission.
Only because of you.

1257
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,000
I don't want any complaints.

1258
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:38,800
No, Sir. There'll be no complaints.
My guarantee. You won't regret it.

1259
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,240
Hold my feet and apologise.
- I already said I am sorry.

1260
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,240
I said I'm sorry.
If I lose it, you'll regret it.

1261
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,720
What will I regret? What?

1262
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:53,000
I'll pay for what?

1263
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,280
Hey! Catch him.

1264
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,040
Satya, get him!

1265
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,840
You know nothing?
Where your son is what he does?

1266
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,480
He never tells us.
- How come he doesn't tell you?

1267
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,800
You know what he has done?

1268
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:46,200
The police came to your place. Those
goons are also looking for you.

1269
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,480
Stay away until
things cool down here.

1270
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:14,600
Maharashtra is a huge state.
Enough for now.

1271
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:20,800
Listen to me, Sir. Hey move.
This is a slum tournament, right?

1272
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,760
Slums are not just here in Nagpur.
They are all over India.

1273
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:24,840
He is right, sir.

1274
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,240
So many people will come!

1275
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:30,440
So what? Don't worry.
They won't sleep at your place.

1276
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,680
He's always full
of such stupid questions.

1277
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,960
Not international.
Let's make it national.

1278
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:41,640
What is this, sir?
- But where to do it?

1279
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,640
Let me check.

1280
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,200
What's international?

1281
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:48,040
It means foreign teams come to play.

1282
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:49,200
What is foreign?

1283
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,000
Foreign means people
from outside India.

1284
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:53,440
What's India?
- Sir, listen to this.

1285
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,200
Sir, look what he is saying.

1286
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,960
Listen to this, Sir.

1287
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,000
What does it mean by India?

1288
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:07,080
Listen. India means
our Gaddi Godam slum.

1289
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:46,880
'National Slum
Football Competition-2018.'

1290
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,240
Hey! Come here.

1291
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,800
I have taken an advance
on the provident fund.

1292
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:08,720
Get out of here. Quick!

1293
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,600
Where's Don? Where's your friend?

1294
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:21,160
Haryana, Kerala, Assam
- Punjab too.

1295
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,320
'Haryana Queen.'

1296
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,320
Where the hell is your Don?
- I don't know, Sir. I swear!

1297
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,200
11 mattresses over there?
Take some upstairs, in another room.

1298
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:32,520
You placed the mattresses
in the other room?

1299
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,440
11 there and four
in the second room.

1300
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,720
Four won't be enough.

1301
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,120
One team has 11 people,
so we need 11 in each room.

1302
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,080
Who's doing the pillows?
- I wasn't the in-charge of it.

1303
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,360
I am not the in-charge of pillows.

1304
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:47,400
Ankush, listen to me.

1305
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:52,120
Wherever you are, go to
the police station and surrender.

1306
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,360
Sir, the police will beat me up bad.

1307
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,560
Listen, Ankush.
Just do as I say. Got it?

1308
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:00,000
We have to fill
up the drums tomorrow.

1309
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:02,080
We have to do it.

1310
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,600
You are acting smart?
- Sir!

1311
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:17,640
You think you are a big don, yeah?

1312
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,800
We have been looking
for you so long!

1313
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:19,800
Druggie.

1314
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,920
Sir, but I surrendered!
- You did us a big favour, yeah?

1315
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,960
Yes? You think you are a don?

1316
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,280
Sit straight.
- Sit straight.

1317
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,960
You want to be a hero.

1318
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,160
Please don't beat me, sir.

1319
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,440
A fugitive tag and being banned from
Nagpur for three months is nothing.

1320
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:39,800
He deserved to go
in for a long time.

1321
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,360
It's all because of that jerk.

1322
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,480
It happened because of no one else.

1323
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:50,160
You just couldn't change yourself.
You blame others.

1324
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:54,720
Had you apologised,
it wouldn't have killed you.

1325
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,920
It is not mandatory
to win every single time.

1326
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,640
Now go and repent your actions.

1327
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,400
And next time you
do something like this,

1328
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,120
remember you have to deal with me.

1329
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:08,680
Go.

1330
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,120
'Tumsar Police Station.'

1331
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,560
Report each and every week
without fail.

1332
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Yes.
- Or else there'll be a warrant.

1333
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,480
And I won't take
any of your crap here.

1334
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,920
Yes, sir.
- What?

1335
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,920
Or we kick your behind.

1336
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,760
Sign here.

1337
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,160
Don Masram.

1338
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:52,680
'This is indeed great for
our country. Give it up, everyone.'

1339
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,400
'People, give it up!'

1340
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:06,160
'Our Gaddi Godam, Nagpur's name
has to be right up there.'

1341
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,160
'Do you play like this
with alcohol too?'

1342
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,760
'This is amazing. Right?'

1343
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,400
'Give it to me a little.
Just see how much it comes.'

1344
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:19,520
'I'll also start now.
- Well said...'

1345
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,240
Heads. He wins.

1346
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,320
'So guys, the referee has...'

1347
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:40,000
"In their eyes,
you are worthless junk."

1348
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:52,760
"You though have a fire
in your belly, you're no skunk!"

1349
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,080
Man! A very good goal.

1350
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:04,680
"Start the fire, burn away the
shackles of prestige and privilege."

1351
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:11,640
"Kick that ball
and launch a missile."

1352
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:18,880
"Kick hard! Kick the ball!"

1353
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:23,040
"No. No. No. Don't stop."

1354
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:26,560
"Don't stop."

1355
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,400
"No. No. No."

1356
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,520
"Kick hard! Kick the ball!"

1357
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,480
"No. No. No. Don't stop."

1358
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:46,160
"No. No. No. Don't stop."

1359
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,640
What are you doing?
Is that where you piss?

1360
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,160
Foul for what?
- You pulled his t-shirt.

1361
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:06,360
Get him some water.

1362
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:10,040
Hey! Leave.

1363
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:14,200
We don't have a damn goalkeeper!

1364
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:16,160
Can I do it?

1365
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,840
Can you do it?

1366
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:36,080
"Kick away to glory,
fly the flags high."

1367
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:39,040
"You do it."

1368
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:43,840
"Anyone dares to be in the way,
Blast through!"

1369
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,640
"You do it."

1370
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:53,520
"Cause of what you are, they
think how could you dare to dream!"

1371
01:52:53,880 --> 01:53:00,520
"They don't know about fate,
she has given you a gift."

1372
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:07,880
"No one has the skills to beat you!"

1373
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:16,160
"Show there is
no one better than you."

1374
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:21,760
"Kick hard! Kick the ball!"

1375
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:25,880
"No. No. No. Don't stop."

1376
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:30,360
After the game, they swear, spit,
tease girls, make a big mess.

1377
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:32,680
They create a lot
of mess near the gate.

1378
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:33,560
No, I...

1379
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:37,720
I'll have a chat with them. This
is a friendly football tournament.

1380
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,520
We understand,
we are under pressure too.

1381
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,800
Something happens tomorrow,
all this crowd...

1382
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,640
We respect you and are holding back
only because of you.

1383
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,440
No, we will try, sir.

1384
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,360
Sir, thank you.

1385
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,680
It's not foul.
- You wait.

1386
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,600
Go on.

1387
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,280
Pass it back.

1388
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,600
Don't you know whom
you are fighting with?

1389
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:02,800
I had told you, right?

1390
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,040
We will come to your house
and beat you.

1391
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:06,600
Hey! What's happening?

1392
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:18,320
Listen. Listen to me. Look.

1393
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:23,880
I request you. I beg you...
It's a friendly tournament.

1394
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:29,240
I request you, I beg you...
Treat everyone nicely.

1395
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:32,680
I beg you and request you.
Please don't fight.

1396
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,880
This is not right.

1397
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:53,080
Stop all this nonsense.
It's beyond your control.

1398
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,840
The whole college is now a slum.

1399
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,360
This is exactly why I was saying no.

1400
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,040
Two more days, please.
I'll make it right.

1401
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,560
You can't. Not possible.

1402
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:17,000
'This is all a big scam.'

1403
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,560
'I know this man.'

1404
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,320
'He is a big fraud.
He just thinks about making money.'

1405
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,760
'Slum football?
How is that even possible?'

1406
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,160
'They are bringing a bad
name to football.'

1407
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:30,480
'And you are giving free publicity.'

1408
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,400
Hey, Imran! Look here.
Sir is here.

1409
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,600
Hold this.
- Sir is here.

1410
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:46,560
What happened today
will not happen again.

1411
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:48,200
We will handle it.

1412
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:52,360
Henceforth, no one will
dare trash anything.

1413
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,080
Don't worry.

1414
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,120
We will make it right, Sir.
No worries.

1415
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,320
Fine.

1416
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,480
"This is it,
time to enforce dreams."

1417
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,440
"Play like you are
their worst dream."

1418
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,320
"They think of you low,
time to put on your show!

1419
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,120
"Bare feet will also make them bow!"

1420
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,040
"So come on!
You were so long a slave!"

1421
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:22,120
"Change that history
your new path to pave!"

1422
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,000
"They swore at you forever, listen."

1423
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,880
"They now clap for you
and won't stop ever!"

1424
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,920
"You get it, right?"

1425
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,880
"Not a simple fight. It's not easy,
you must try with all your might."

1426
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:33,640
"You can do it.
You've got your heart all right!"

1427
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,520
"Hard work takes you to
the last station."

1428
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,480
"It'll make
the world take a lesson!"

1429
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:42,200
"Animals live too. It's time
to be alive and be a legend."

1430
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:53,280
"Kick away to glory,
fly flags high."

1431
01:57:53,680 --> 01:58:01,240
"Anyone dares to be in the way
blast through."

1432
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,400
Well played, what's your name?
- Bobby.

1433
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,800
Nice. Well played.

1434
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:08,840
Uncle, don't you get it? Just leave.
Kindly leave.

1435
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,000
Well played. Your name?
- Raju.

1436
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,840
Well played, Raju.

1437
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:14,480
Your name?
- Badal.

1438
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,880
Badal, you played well.

1439
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,440
This is a good experience for us.
This is the first time we are here.

1440
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:23,360
Such a good experience.
Thanks to Mr. Vijay.

1441
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,680
I like playing football.

1442
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:31,160
This big tournament.
I liked playing here.

1443
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:34,120
I like this tournament

1444
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:37,000
and hope they organise it again.

1445
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:40,120
Slum youth is playing here
in such a way

1446
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,800
like it's a big
international tournament.

1447
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:46,520
Did you ever think that this
would happen at such a scale?

1448
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:51,360
I don't know.
I felt that I should do this.

1449
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,080
It would be good for these kids.

1450
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:57,160
I thought if they play football,
it can lead to something better.

1451
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,600
And the rest is as you see it.

1452
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,600
It just happened.
Never imagined it like this.

1453
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:04,320
Razıa, they say you are married.

1454
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,680
That's right.
I have three daughters too.

1455
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,360
'What does your husband do?
- He is a businessman.'

1456
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:13,680
'He supports you on this?
- Yes, he sure does.'

1457
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,640
'Do you want your daughters
to play as well?'

1458
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:21,480
'Yes, for sure. I want them
to become something in life.'

1459
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:44,120
It has been a wonderful tournament.

1460
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:46,360
Teams participated
from all over India.

1461
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:49,880
Honestly, I did not think
it was possible.

1462
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:55,720
But Mr. Borade has done
a great job here.

1463
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,400
The real winner is... Mr. Vijay.

1464
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:50,080
I place an order long time ago.
- It's coming.

1465
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,800
When? Next year?

1466
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,920
Buzz off.
- What are you staring at? Buzz off

1467
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:01,240
Just two minutes
- Get it, man.

1468
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:03,080
Hurry, man. Quick.

1469
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:37,560
Trying to associate with
homeless soccer association too.

1470
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,680
You have no idea of
what you have achieved here.

1471
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:45,040
I had ventured overseas
for opportunities

1472
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:48,520
and you created them here.

1473
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:57,840
Are you quitting the course?

1474
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:00,880
Not going back?

1475
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:05,600
No, Dad. Not going back.

1476
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:11,920
Tea is good.

1477
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,680
Look at him laying so peacefully.

1478
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:28,320
I told you so many times.

1479
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:31,600
Carry on now, die.

1480
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:43,480
Hey, Karthik.

1481
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:48,360
Ankush.

1482
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:51,200
Come here.

1483
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,040
Yes, sir?

1484
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:56,520
What are you doing here?
- I came as I was missing everyone.

1485
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:59,600
No, you shouldn't be breaking
the rules. You can't be here.

1486
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,960
You are banned from here.

1487
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:03,440
Just leave.

1488
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:07,840
And don't come back until your
expulsion period is over.

1489
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:09,520
Dad.
- Yes.

1490
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:12,880
We have an invitation
from Homeless Soccer.

1491
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,280
World Slum Football.

1492
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,520
It's a big achievement.

1493
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,320
But we have to manage
the travel expenses.

1494
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,840
Just can't find it.

1495
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:35,960
(Indistinct chatter)

1496
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:39,480
Khelchand!
- Of course. He plays very well.

1497
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:42,200
His name is Khelchand.
Of course, he plays well.

1498
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:44,200
Will you play?

1499
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,400
Confirm his name.

1500
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:50,920
Whose phone is this?

1501
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:57,840
Raju, you have been selected
for Homeless World Cup. Badal too.

1502
02:03:58,320 --> 02:03:59,720
Thank you, sir.

1503
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,400
Sir, I have been
selected for World Cup.

1504
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,680
Yeah, right.

1505
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,760
Sir, it's the truth. We are caught
watching the film without a ticket.

1506
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:09,920
I swear on Goddess Durga.

1507
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:14,320
I don't want to get married.
- Every girl says that.

1508
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,240
We also used to say that.

1509
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:18,360
Ma, let me play for some more time.
- You've played enough already.

1510
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:23,080
If she wants to play, let her play.
Starve yourselves,

1511
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:24,640
but let her play

1512
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,920
Let her do what she wants.
That's all.

1513
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:32,000
Hello, Jagdish.
This is Vijay Borade.

1514
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:34,480
You have been selected
for World Cup football.

1515
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:41,960
Sir, that girl was not
from this village.

1516
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,360
It was from a village close by.

1517
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,520
Address, please.

1518
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:54,640
"We all must live,
find a reason to be alive."

1519
02:04:54,720 --> 02:05:00,480
"We all must live,
find a reason to be alive."

1520
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:11,920
"If you cannot find hard shores,
at least a straw of grass."

1521
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:23,040
"Why curse this empty starkness?"

1522
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:27,600
"Make friends with life.
There's a way out of this darkness."

1523
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,200
Uncle.
- Yes.

1524
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,600
Uncle.
- Yes.

1525
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:35,760
Uncle! Some people are here to
meet your daughter from Nagpur.

1526
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:38,680
He says
why do we send her so far away?

1527
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:42,920
She went away recently,
was no use for us.

1528
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,960
Tell him that but...

1529
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:48,640
She plays football very well.

1530
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:52,520
And that's why she has
been invited from overseas.

1531
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:55,400
(Regional language)

1532
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:59,240
(Regional language)

1533
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:02,720
(Regional language)

1534
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,960
(Regional language)

1535
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:06,800
(Regional language)

1536
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:10,000
(Regional language)

1537
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:11,680
It will be very
good for her future.

1538
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:14,040
Ask them
if they have all the documents.

1539
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:15,040
Nothing.

1540
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,840
(Regional language)

1541
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:23,000
Here. Give it to him
for her passport.

1542
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:25,560
(Regional language)

1543
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:27,720
(Regional language)

1544
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:30,000
She is very good at football.
- It will be good for her.

1545
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:33,920
(Regional language)

1546
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:37,200
Keep this money and arrange
for Monika's passport.

1547
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,040
Don't you dare step
inside the house.

1548
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:42,840
I just need some documents.

1549
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:44,760
You've brought shame to the family.

1550
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,800
What do you expect now?

1551
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,000
Just hand me those documents
and I'll be on my way.

1552
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,960
Get going now. Understand?

1553
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:03,760
We need a passport.

1554
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,680
Documents?

1555
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:10,600
We don't have any documents.
We heard you issue a passport.

1556
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,760
Yes, but for passport
we need documents.

1557
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:15,080
Do something, please.

1558
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,280
You need documents for passport.

1559
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:19,480
There's a whole list,
ask someone outside.

1560
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,800
(Regional language)

1561
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,920
(Regional language)

1562
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:27,200
Who's going overseas?

1563
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:28,840
My daughter here.

1564
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:35,480
Get all documents first.
- Please make them for us, Sir.

1565
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:37,960
I cannot make your documents here.

1566
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:41,440
(Regional language)

1567
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,320
(Regional language)

1568
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:47,880
(Regional language)

1569
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:51,960
(Regional language)

1570
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:53,960
(Regional language)

1571
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:55,960
(Regional language)

1572
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,520
(Regional language)

1573
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:02,760
(Regional language)

1574
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:05,160
You need a certificate for that.

1575
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:07,200
We don't have no papers.

1576
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:10,120
You can't do anything
without the documents.

1577
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:12,720
For example, where do you live?

1578
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,520
India? Pakistan?

1579
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:15,920
We are from right here.

1580
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,800
You know that.
I know it, but they don't.

1581
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,040
So what do we do?

1582
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:24,040
Do one thing.
You get a domicile certificate.

1583
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:27,440
School leaving
or whatever you have.

1584
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:29,640
Show it to the government.
Then it's done.

1585
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:33,360
Could you make a
list of what we need?

1586
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:36,320
I will arrange it for you.
Have your lunch by then.

1587
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:39,160
The thing is the government doesn't
care if you are actually alive.

1588
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:41,360
They need proof.

1589
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,600
A living being has no value.

1590
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,560
Certificate for both living
as well as dead.

1591
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:53,360
Please let me just speak with her.

1592
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:56,480
Why now? There's nothing to say.

1593
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:57,680
Razia.

1594
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:01,400
Razia, you said divorce, but
we can't be divorced just like that.

1595
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:07,080
Okay, don't talk to me
if you don't want to.

1596
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,480
You wanted some documents, right?

1597
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:13,840
Here they are.

1598
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:29,000
Could've put on something formal!

1599
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,000
You could've worn
something formal.

1600
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,080
This?

1601
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:36,440
What's wrong with this here?

1602
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:40,840
You have a tie on,
that should be enough.

1603
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:49,680
What did you say it was?
- Homeless soccer. Slum soccer.

1604
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:51,800
So...
- Sir, football.

1605
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,680
All right, football.

1606
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,680
So kids from slums
will play there?

1607
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,880
Yes, Sir. From all over the world.

1608
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:01,440
If there's an invitation,
they should pay, right?

1609
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:04,200
They won't send an empty invite.

1610
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:05,880
The invitation

1611
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:08,080
itself is a big thing.
- All right.

1612
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:12,240
They will pay for some expenses.
We have to manage travel.

1613
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,360
Never heard of this Homeless
Soccer and all. First time.

1614
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:18,960
This is an invitation.
- I heard for the first time.

1615
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:21,400
That's the invitation and profiles
of the team players.

1616
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:29,200
All from slums? All of them?
- They will represent India, Sir.

1617
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:33,760
You also going? Foreign tour?

1618
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,200
Excuse me, I'll wait outside.

1619
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:46,080
Alright, let's see how it goes,
when we get to it.

1620
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,800
Please.

1621
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,600
I won't beg in front of anyone.

1622
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:10,480
I will not plead for money.

1623
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:18,520
How do we get all this money?
We need to ask for it.

1624
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:20,960
We have to raise the funds.

1625
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:26,040
You can't do it all
with your own money.

1626
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,600
Oh!

1627
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,600
I'll take care of that.

1628
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:38,240
I cannot accept it
that the kids have to pay

1629
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,640
for their travel expenses.

1630
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:43,400
No.

1631
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,560
'District Primary School.'

1632
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,800
How many years did she study here?

1633
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:51,440
Two days, Sir.

1634
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:55,360
Two whole days yes?
Try and find her name.

1635
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:57,400
What was the name?

1636
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:00,240
Monika Maniklal Gedam.

1637
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:02,920
What do you need
the certificate for?

1638
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,640
She plays well. That's why.

1639
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:08,960
What does she play?
- Football.

1640
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,920
Is it? Very impressive.

1641
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:14,760
Found a Jiva Manik Gedam.
- Who is that?

1642
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:18,520
That's the elder son.
- Find the girl's name.

1643
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:24,080
No, found only Jiva.

1644
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:26,040
Her name cannot be found.

1645
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:28,600
I am giving a certificate anyway
on my risk.

1646
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:32,320
Just don't tell anyone. I am
giving it just for your daughter.

1647
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:35,840
Sir, sign here.

1648
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:40,360
Here.

1649
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:43,920
Best of luck. Play well.
- Yes.

1650
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,360
Look at this.

1651
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:00,200
You idiot, give me your hand!

1652
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:02,080
You are an international
player now.

1653
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:05,880
Selected for an international team!
And you keep it a secret!

1654
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,960
Congratulations, buddy.

1655
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:14,880
Dad.
- Yes.

1656
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:18,440
You mortgaged our land?

1657
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:22,400
I was in the process
of raising money.

1658
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:25,120
Website too.
It is just a matter of time.

1659
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:28,360
We don't have that much time.

1660
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:31,480
I am doing what I can.
You do what you do.

1661
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:33,520
I will be back.

1662
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,680
Razıa Amjad Bagwan.

1663
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,240
These are her originals
and photocopies.

1664
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:51,360
That should do.

1665
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:04,880
'Village Council, Pangdi.'

1666
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:07,160
What about her?

1667
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:09,360
You need a domicile certificate?

1668
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:11,800
It's not that easy.

1669
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:15,080
You need a letter from a gazetted
or well-known person.

1670
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:17,280
Only then you may get it.

1671
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:19,560
Here.

1672
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:24,120
I have never been so
disturbed in my life.

1673
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:26,400
Is Mr. Vijay at home?

1674
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,200
I want to meet Mr. Vijay.
- Have a seat.

1675
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:33,440
Sir, I am Mahesh Bhosale.

1676
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,120
You've been doing
a great thing for the kids.

1677
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,880
I would like to contribute...

1678
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:44,840
Please, we are not asking for help.

1679
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,160
We shall manage somehow.
Please don't do that.

1680
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:50,080
Sir, I have a small shop
in our slum.

1681
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:52,720
I have seen
what these kids did before.

1682
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,840
Something good is happening now.
Please don't refuse.

1683
02:14:57,200 --> 02:15:01,560
Ankush, I saw in the newspaper.
Good stuff.

1684
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:03,800
See you.

1685
02:15:14,120 --> 02:15:18,360
Identity letter? For that
I need to know who you are.

1686
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:20,440
Which village?

1687
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:24,960
We are from Pada.
- Pada!

1688
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:26,760
Yes, we are from nearby village
of Pada.

1689
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:28,240
Never seen you there.

1690
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:33,120
We keep travelling for work.
We have seen you.

1691
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,560
You've seen me, have you?
You know me?

1692
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:36,960
Who needs a letter?

1693
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:39,520
My daughter's.
- Right?

1694
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:43,200
So I need to know you.
That's how it works.

1695
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:45,280
But we know you, Sir.

1696
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,880
Hey, listen.

1697
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:48,880
You know him?
- No.

1698
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:51,080
Have you seen the girl someplace?
- No. Never.

1699
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:53,520
He doesn't know you
I don't.

1700
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,680
That's the whole point
I need to know you.

1701
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:58,080
We came here cause they told us
it's done here.

1702
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:01,120
I'll tell you what...

1703
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:04,040
Come day after tomorrow.

1704
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:05,840
Fine.

1705
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:09,320

1706
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:11,000

1708
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:18,840

1709
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:21,200

1710
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:24,480
(Regional language)

1711
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:27,640
(Regional language)

1712
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:33,040
I think it's my turn.
I will go.

1713
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:42,800
Your name?
- Don... Ankush Masram.

1714
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:44,840
Sit, please. A photo first.

1715
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:46,880
Applying first time?
- Yes, ma'am.

1716
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,440
Education?
- Class 5.

1717
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:54,520
Check your father's name.
Mother's name spelling.

1718
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:56,960
Smile a little.

1719
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,280
Keep it here.

1720
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:02,880
Keep your right hand.

1721
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,960
Thumb. Keep both your thumbs.

1722
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,440
The documents will be verified.

1723
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,960
Go to the NC counter, okay?

1724
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,560
Go straight and take a left.

1725
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:20,240
Okay.

1726
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:22,480
Your process is complete.

1727
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:23,560
Thank you.

1728
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,880
That's 7300.

1729
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:29,720
Your wife also bought
grocery worth 700.

1730
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:35,480
When? After I become like you?
- Just this one time, please.

1731
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:37,680
You come here asking
so many times.

1732
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:39,080
You just...

1733
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:41,840
Damn! You again!

1734
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:45,120
Found someone who
can recommend you?

1735
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:47,360
Him! He knows me.

1736
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:50,800
You know him?

1737
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:52,720
Sure, I do he lives in Pada.

1738
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,800
He needs an identity
recommendation. What do you say?

1739
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:58,360
What for?

1740
02:17:58,560 --> 02:17:59,520
For her.

1741
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:02,320
Why?
- I have to send her overseas.

1742
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:05,120
No shady business, right?
- No.

1743
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:06,040
Sure?

1744
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:10,040
Please! It's for my daughter.
No shady business.

1745
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:13,160
You know me?
- Sure? Sure?

1746
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:15,400
Give it to him.

1747
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:18,480
Should I? for you.
I don't know them at all.

1748
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:20,000
I know her.
- Bring it.

1749
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:21,920
Tell me your name.
- Monica.

1750
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:25,600
Monica.
- Gedam.

1751
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:32,280
I am giving it, okay?
Because you said so.

1752
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:52,640
Stand here.

1753
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,160
Greetings, sir!

1754
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:47,800
Greetings!

1755
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:51,320
I'll take care of
Razia's travel expense.

1756
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:54,760
Thank you.

1757
02:19:58,160 --> 02:19:59,840
Sir, my passport hasn't arrived yet.

1758
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:03,000
My friends applied after me.
They received it already.

1759
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:06,880
Everything is okay. Just haven't
received the police clearance yet.

1760
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:09,400
So, I need to go to
the police station?

1761
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:10,560
Yes

1762
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:16,080
Hey! Wait. Wait.

1763
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:24,960
What are you doing here?
- Needed some help, please.

1764
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:28,160
Stabbed someone again?
- No, nothing like that.

1765
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:30,040
What do you want?

1766
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:33,120
Police verification for a passport.

1767
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:35,240
Passport?
- Yes.

1768
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:37,800
What's your name?
- Ankush Masram.

1769
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:39,760
Find his file, will you?

1770
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:47,960
But your name's Don, right?
- That's what people call me.

1771
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:52,560
Two names, yeah?
That's a clear fraud.

1772
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:56,120
How many passports do you have?
- This is the first one.

1773
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:00,120
You have some cases against you too.
- Let it go, Sir.

1774
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:03,000
Let it go? For a passport?

1775
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:05,320
You want to stab
someone overseas too?

1776
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:06,400
Please, Sir.

1777
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:10,680
What please? What do you mean?
Leave from here.

1778
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:17,240
What are you staring at?
Go away.

1779
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,840
Come.

1780
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:25,360
He is staring at me.

1781
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:27,040
Come, let's go.

1782
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:46,360
You take this
football team overseas.

1783
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:48,120
What if they murder someone there?

1784
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:52,760
Sir, please come in.
Hey, get some tea and stuff.

1785
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:56,920
So Mr. Vijay, please stay out
of it. Let the court decide.

1786
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,480
Can you not help, please?
The departure date is very close.

1787
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:05,320
I can't do anything.
Sir, please sit.

1788
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:09,320
This way?

1789
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:12,120
This is the invitation letter
for the World Cup.

1790
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:13,640
Alright.
- The invitation.

1791
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:15,240
And on this side...

1792
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:16,760
Also newspaper cuttings
and information.

1793
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:18,440
Okay.

1794
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:32,280
My lord.

1795
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:36,880
If we give passports to people
with criminal background,

1796
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:38,160
send them overseas,

1797
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:41,600
they will malign
the name of our country.

1798
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:45,680
To encourage them
is to encourage crimes.

1799
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:48,840
Respected Mr. Borade.

1800
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:51,920
He wants to take this horde
to a foreign country.

1801
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,920
My suggestion is

1802
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:56,600
along with Ankush... Don,

1803
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:59,800
this entire team... horde's
passports should be cancelled.

1804
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,120
That's all.

1805
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:04,600
I do not agree with
the prosecution at all.

1806
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:06,680
Mr. Vijay is doing
a great thing here.

1807
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:08,720
Your honour, I...

1808
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:13,080
Your honour, I would like to
say something on behalf of my team

1809
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,840
if you agree.

1810
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:16,640
Okay, sure.
- Okay, thank you.

1811
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:21,640
Respected ma'am.

1812
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:26,640
These kids are not social evil.

1813
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:29,720
They are our own.

1814
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:35,320
We have boycotted them
for ages together.

1815
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:39,440
No one is a criminal
at birth, surely.

1816
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:43,560
And no one ventures
into crime willingly.

1817
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:48,120
Why would someone like to commit a
crime and find himself behind bars?

1818
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:54,720
I have spent some time
with these young people.

1819
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:57,200
They are good kids.

1820
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:59,600
They play football.

1821
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:04,760
This girl here. She's from Haryana.

1822
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:08,280
She lives in a slum

1823
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:10,760
and has played football
and has represented her state.

1824
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:16,520
This is Khelchand.

1825
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:21,600
He is a security guard,
but he plays magical football.

1826
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:23,920
She is Razia.

1827
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:27,920
She has steeled herself into
a shield for her three daughters.

1828
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:35,440
How can we deny
these people their talent?

1829
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,120
Who makes their selection?

1830
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:41,960
Where does this happen?
This selection process?

1831
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,640
Mumbai? Sports Academy?

1832
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:50,320
Mumbai, Sports Academy
is not the entire India.

1833
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:56,360
Schools, colleges, universities.
There's an India beyond their walls

1834
02:24:56,960 --> 02:24:58,880
and it's vast.

1835
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,120
We simply cannot ignore that.

1836
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:09,680
Some of these kids can hunt

1837
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:12,840
an animal with a stone.

1838
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:18,000
Hand them a cricket ball

1839
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:21,400
and they can become
fastest bowlers ever.

1840
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:26,080
You say that
these kids get into fights.

1841
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,040
They rob, they run.

1842
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:32,680
Yes, they run! They run very fast!

1843
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:39,720
Get them to run at the Olympics.
A gold medal is assured!

1844
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:45,920
They are running away
from the unfairness of life.

1845
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:48,520
The unfairness of life.

1846
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:54,240
He is Satya.

1847
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:59,560
He was charged with
breaking a pipe, water pipe.

1848
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:02,560
The pipe used to send
water to the cities.

1849
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:04,640
He has been blamed for
breaking that pipe.

1850
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:08,160
His slum had no water for four days.

1851
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:11,320
Is that a crime now?
Trying to find water?

1852
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:14,720
The way I understand this is...

1853
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:17,600
These kids are simply fighting.

1854
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:21,560
to stay alive, for life.

1855
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:24,520
And is life a crime?

1856
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:30,080
I agree that they may not know
right from wrong.

1857
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:33,480
At home when children
do something wrong,

1858
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:35,680
we scold them, punish them a little.

1859
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,120
You surely do not evict them
from your home.

1860
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:45,080
If you decide to
brand them criminals

1861
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:47,000
and shut them behind bars,

1862
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:53,520
you will not simply deny
them their future.

1863
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:55,640
Because they are.

1864
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:02,400
Because they are our future,
all of them are our future.

1865
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:06,920
Tiny little countries
England, Germany.

1866
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,800
They take away all medals
in Olympics.

1867
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:10,840
I simply cannot accept that such.

1868
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:13,680
a vast country like ours
lacks talent, no way.

1869
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:21,600
No matter how talented
these kids are.

1870
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:26,480
They can never find you,
find justice.

1871
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:31,560
Because of this huge wall, you have
created between you and them.

1872
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:35,000
To jump over this wall
and reach you is almost impossible.

1873
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,680
It is up to you to break this wall,
so that you can reach them.

1874
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:43,880
We need to fight against
this wall together.

1875
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:46,480
Respected Court!

1876
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:51,360
You say that this is a wild horde.

1877
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:54,040
This is the horde.

1878
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:02,080
But I say this is
our National Football Team.

1879
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:07,280
And this boy Ankush
is a very talented player

1880
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:09,960
who in this World Cup

1881
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:14,200
Shall proudly represent India!

1882
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:17,320
India.

1883
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:24,120
I urge that he be given
this one chance.

1884
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:26,880
Just this one.

1885
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:48,280
You will come again, right?
- Don't worry.

1886
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:54,360
Wow! Don.

1887
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:59,480
Ankush.

1888
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:01,080
Come here.

1889
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:05,560
Look, you...

1890
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:08,520
Don't lose heart, alright?

1891
02:29:09,360 --> 02:29:10,680
Keep training.

1892
02:29:11,160 --> 02:29:14,840
We shall go next year again.
Okay?

1893
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:25,320
Hey! Bye, everyone.

1894
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:27,840
Bye, everyone.

1895
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:29,280
Bye.

1896
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:32,200
Take care of sir.

1897
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:34,560
Eat well.

1898
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:37,720
Bye.
- Make our country proud.

1899
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:50,600
You carry on. I'll walk.

1900
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:52,720
Where are you going?

1901
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:56,240
Just going to kill that
Constable Waghmare.

1902
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:59,640
Waghmare... I'll knock him out.

1903
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:02,440
What wicket? Knock out?
- You guys go.

1904
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:03,600
Come on.

1905
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:07,320
No one's getting anyone's wicket.
You gone crazy or what?

1906
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:09,800
Don't be stupid. Let's go.

1907
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:11,520
Go, guys.
Let's meet at jail tomorrow.

1908
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:14,120
Let's go together.

1909
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:18,320
You want Waghmare
let's do him together.

1910
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:20,840
Let's drink some
and then we'll get him.

1911
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:27,920
You guys eat yet?

1912
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:36,720
Don, there you go.

1913
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,160
I am going to kill him.

1914
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:53,640
Look, things are getting better

1915
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:56,600
I want to get better!
Why won't they let me?

1916
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:58,360
Don!

1917
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,320
I got this one chance and they
want to snatch it away from me!

1918
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:10,280
Sambe ruined my life.

1919
02:32:10,360 --> 02:32:13,440
And now this constable.

1920
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:18,360
Murder tonight, that's it.

1921
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,160
Don't be stupid, bro.
- Murder it is.

1922
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:31,800
Imran, the bus would be
half way to Mumbai, right?

1923
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:36,440
Half way to Mumbai already.

1924
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:41,360
Everyone's on the bus except me.

1925
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:43,920
Let it be.

1926
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:13,840
This is the last
and final sports award this year.

1927
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:18,000
And now on this joyous occasion,

1928
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:21,200
I request the Honourable
Chief Minister

1929
02:33:21,320 --> 02:33:25,560
to felicitate
Mr. Vijay Borade and his team.

1930
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:28,920
He has got together
a talented football team.

1931
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:30,480
from slums all over India.

1932
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:33,280
This team will represent India at

1933
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:35,920
the World Homeless
Soccer tournament.

1934
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:51,560
Masram...

1935
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:52,960
Hello.
- Yes.

1936
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,920
Ankush Mishram.
- Not Mishram, Masram.

1937
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:56,760
Yes. Your passport's here.

1938
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:03,280
Don, I am tired.

1939
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:04,960
How much will you make us run?

1940
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:06,480
Let's wait a little.

1941
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:14,760
Is Ankush here?
- No, he's not home.

1942
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:16,920
His passport's here.
- Give me. I'll give it to him.

1943
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:18,840
I can't hand it over to you.

1944
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:20,320
Brother.

1945
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:29,200
Hey!

1946
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:56,680
Babu, come fast.

1947
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:09,640
Come here. Book a ticket.

1948
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,960
Babu, ticket window, go!

1949
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:24,520
How are you, brother?

1950
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:38,800
What are you staring at?
- Look down.

1951
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:43,480
Who the hell do you think you are?
- Please let it go, bro.

1952
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:44,840
You think you are too smart?

1953
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:47,840
You want to kill me?

1954
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:52,800
Forehead on my feet and say sorry.

1955
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:57,200
Don't hit me.

1956
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:58,680
Rub your nose.

1957
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:07,400
Please let me go. I said I am sorry.

1958
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:10,440
Sorry? Are you doing me a favour?

1959
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:12,920
I apologised, right?

1960
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:16,560
Please let me go.
I said I am sorry.

1961
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:21,400
Don't do it. Just stay quiet.
Why are you hitting back?

1962
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:24,920
Say sorry. Don't make it worse.
Let it be.

1963
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:27,920
Just say sorry.
- Don't do all this here, please.

1964
02:36:28,040 --> 02:36:31,520
Want to hit me?
- Just say sorry!

1965
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,400
Fine.

1966
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:43,880
Okay sorry, but let him go, please.

1967
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:45,680
Please let us go.
- Hey!

1968
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:47,320
What's happening here?

1969
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:09,240
Excuse me.
I need to talk to Ankush.

1970
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:11,040
May I?

1971
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:32,720
Come. Come.

1972
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:48,200
There it is. There...

1973
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,320
Come, everyone.

1974
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:01,080
Are you Mr. Vijay?
- Yes, ma'am.

1975
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:03,080
Good morning, sir.
We are happy to inform you

1976
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:04,960
that you have been
upgraded to Spice Max.

1977
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:06,640
So let me help you all
with your check-in.

1978
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:08,240
Okay. Thank you.

1979
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:10,320
Thank you.
- This is the passport of my...

1980
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:11,320
Okay.

1981
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:12,760
Give it to me.

1982
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:20,600
These are the passports and tickets.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1983
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:23,560
And your boarding passes.

1984
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:35,520
Hello.

1985
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:37,880
Arjun Dada, I am here.

1986
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:41,840
Where are they?
- He says they are coming out?

1987
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:43,840
Call him once.

1988
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:47,000
Where's Jerry and everyone?
- Inside I guess.

1989
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:49,400
Look at that, all made of glass.

1990
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:54,480
Suresh, take the bag.

1991
02:38:56,840 --> 02:38:58,120
This place is so good.

1992
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:04,200
I'll be waiting for you.

1993
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:12,840
Bhavana ma'am, he's already high...
His plane is flying...

1994
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:18,600
Sir, ticket.

1995
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:33,440
He'll be back.
He hasn't gone forever.

1996
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:38,000
What's in the bag?
- No, there's nothing.

1997
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:05,440
Hey!

1998
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,400
Stand in line.

1999
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:14,000
Can't break the line, mate.

2000
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,320
Hi!

2001
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:25,680
Don made it finally.

2002
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:32,760
What's that?
- It’s a mobile phone, sir.

2003
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:34,120
Take it out.

2004
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,600
Your wallet.

2005
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:37,720
Drop it in the tray.

2006
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:54,840
Stop. Belt. Shoes too.

2007
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:04,840
In the tray. Shoes in the tray.

2008
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,040
Come.

2009
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:16,320
Hands up.

2010
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:24,440
What's in there?

2011
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:26,160
Nothing.

2012
02:41:28,760 --> 02:41:29,800
Out with it.

2013
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:41,080
Where are you taking the cutter?

2014
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:45,720
Nowhere... I forgot it was there.

2015
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:47,240
Chuck it away.

2016
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:51,520
Here?
- Throw it away.

2017
02:43:21,560 --> 02:43:25,200
It's okay. It's done.
Come on.

2018
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:27,600
It's fine.

2019
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:49,480
Okay. Enough.

2020
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:52,800
Come.

2021
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:09,560
"Make way for us,
we'll fall a 1000 times."

2022
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:11,440
"But we shall rise again,
will run, will sprint."

2023
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:14,200
"We'll break through, thick and thin
Stop us if you dare."

2024
02:45:14,400 --> 02:45:17,160
"These walls that you've built.
Our spirit shall make them break."

2025
02:45:17,240 --> 02:45:20,040
"You say horde, our slum team
is set on one team we bet."

2026
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:23,520
"Your uneven walls of shame,
have holes all the same."

2027
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:26,040
"You treat us like crap,
you just don't get it, mate."

2028
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:28,840
"You set fire to us,
but we are made of hard metal."

2029
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:31,320
"It's our day now our lotus
has risen out of this mud."

2030
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:35,880
"No longer a horde,
we are now a team!"

2031
02:47:09,440 --> 02:47:14,880
"In their eyes,
you are worthless junk."

2032
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:26,480
"You though have a fire
in your belly, you're no skunk!"

2033
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,560
"Start the fire."

2034
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:38,240
"Burn away the
shackles of prestige and privilege."

2035
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:46,120
"Kick that ball
and launch a missile."

2036
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:50,880
"Kick it. Kick it."

2037
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:55,080
"Kick it. No. No. No."

2038
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:58,040
"Don't stop. Don't stop."

2039
02:47:58,920 --> 02:48:02,760
"Don't stop. No. No. No."

2040
02:48:02,840 --> 02:48:08,360
"Kick it. Kick it."

2041
02:48:08,560 --> 02:48:10,400
"No. No. No."

2042
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:16,120
"Don't stop. Don't stop."

2043
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:18,120
"No. No. No."

2044
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:22,040
"We have to fulfil our dreams.
We will play as everyone's death."

2045
02:48:22,120 --> 02:48:23,840
"We shall change
their petty thinking."

2046
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:25,800
"Show them the anger
of torn slippers."

2047
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:29,680
"Come on, now you are
going to change history."

2048
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:33,560
"All the people who cursed you
are clapping for you now."

2049
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:36,480
"It's not so easy
to walk that path."

2050
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:39,160
"What you're thinking is
not for ordinary people."

2051
02:48:39,240 --> 02:48:41,120
"There is enough
strength in your heart."

2052
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:43,200
"You will reach your destiny."

2053
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:45,120
"Do something that will
teach the world a lesson."

2054
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,040
"Even animals live their life."

2055
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:49,760
"It's time for you
to be a legend."

2056
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:57,400
"Do something and raise your flag.
- Raise your flag."

2057
02:48:57,520 --> 02:49:04,240
"Remove all the obstacles
that come in your way."

2058
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:11,960
"People think since you are poor
that what is your status?"

2059
02:49:12,320 --> 02:49:19,040
"They don't know that even
destiny has given you a gift."

2060
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:21,560
"Defeat them. Defeat them."

2061
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:26,720
"No one has the strength
that you have got."

2062
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:34,960
"Show it that even you
are not less than anyone."

2063
02:49:35,080 --> 02:49:44,320
"Kick hard! Kick the ball!
No. No. Don't stop."
