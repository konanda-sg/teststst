1
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't you think I want
everyone's happiness?

2
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,292
That nobody suffers?

3
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,333
But what do you care?

4
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,833
You too belong to this filthy society.

5
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,417
All of you sit here in disguise...

6
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,125
...hiding your real
faces behind masquerades.

7
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,250
That's why they all look alike, mom.

8
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,667
Look...

9
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,083
...they are all alike.

10
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,250
That's the way of the world, my son.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,708
What will happen...

12
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,208
...will happen.

13
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,667
That's why I feel tired, mom.

14
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,917
I'm weary.

15
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,125
I've lost all desire to stay alive.

16
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,875
I am anyway...

17
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,625
...a mere Joker in this house of cards.

18
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,292
They are the real players.

19
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,583
Son, no!

20
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,542
No!

21
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,417
No, son.

22
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,333
Son...
Son, wake up.

23
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:31,208
Wake up, what have you done? My god!

24
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,042
Whose phone is that?
Whose is it?

25
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,542
Will someone speak up?

26
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,167
That's my phone.
Just a moment.

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
Sorry sir, it's my
phone. Just a minute.

28
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,458
Sanjay!

29
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,458
I didn't even tear up yet!

30
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:48,375
It's urgent, sir. From the office.

31
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,125
I've got to go. Sorry,
I have to take this.

32
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:50,958
She...

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,083
-Go and lie down.
-I...

34
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,417
Make do with her for now, sir.

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,417
Yeah.

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,750
Send her to lie in the
main show too, okay? Scoundrel!

37
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,000
-Just make do for now, mom.
-Handle it!

38
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,500
Hey...

39
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,208
-Sir, the role should at least be worthy enough.
-I'll see to it, sir.

40
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,042
Best of luck.

41
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,708
The city of Delhi
knows me as its Meryl Streep, sir.

42
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:07,583
Okay.

43
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,292
Next production, you're my leading lady.
Okay?

44
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,333
You stay dead!

45
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,167
Son!

46
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,250
Mom, I was hard at work.

47
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,583
I've left, yeah. On my way.

48
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,250
Yeah.

49
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,583
Don't do this, sister.

50
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,792
What would it do to dad?

51
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,083
Relax, Sneha.

52
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:35,333
I'll flee the nest only after you hatch.

53
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,458
Did you speak to brother
or should I help?

54
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,167
Speak to brother!

55
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,792
Will it make any difference?

56
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,083
Won't the blind man listen to his stick?

57
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:50,042
He will, definitely.

58
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,833
Don't worry.

59
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,875
I'll talk to brother about this.

60
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,417
Brother will listen, so will dad.

61
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,917
Bye.

62
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,208
Hello.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,375
Hi.

64
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,083
Hello.

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
Hello.

66
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,333
You start.

67
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,167
I tend to be dumb in such situations.

68
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,750
Do dumb guys work in
multi-national companies?

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
My parents sold me well, I suppose.

70
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,917
Great.

71
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:38,958
Well, I'd like to know more about you
so tell me.

72
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,875
I work for a BPO.

73
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,583
But don't worry, no night shifts.

74
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,417
-Is Babloo fooling around?
-What?

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,667
Is that why you're being shy?

76
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,208
Yeah, mom told me.

77
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,833
If you wish, we'll
continue this at night.

78
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,833
My family's fine with it.

79
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,292
Actually,...

80
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,750
...the reception's a bit weak here.

81
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,333
That's why.

82
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,917
No problem.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,167
As long as you receive my signals.

84
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:13,667
Aditi, you...
Are you crazy?

85
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,083
You'll get me executed one day.

86
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,167
Does all evil in you spout
out only during my calls?

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,750
Then tell mumma dearest to stop
hunting wedding proposals for you.

88
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:24,917
Only then will my inner Satan calm down.

89
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,458
You're receiving my signals, right?

90
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,542
-You sure?
-Yes, my love.

91
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,333
Next.

92
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,792
-Name?
-Sanjay Lal Singh.

93
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,000
What acrobatics shall you display?

94
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,125
I want to propose to you.

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,417
The seniors asked me to.

96
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,292
If the seniors tell you...

97
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,542
...tease the girl, grab
her and kiss her...

98
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,042
-...will you mutely comply?
-He will.

99
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,292
I'm a senior as well.

100
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,875
From here on out, whenever you
see me, you will apologise.

101
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,583
- Okay.
- How?

102
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:23,875
Get lost.

103
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,208
-Go, we don't have much time.
-Yes.

104
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:30,125
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

105
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,708
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

106
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,583
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

107
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,542
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

108
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,833
"A little sweet and a
little bit tangy"...

109
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,250
... "such is our perfect pair."

110
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:07,792
-"My heart longs only for you"...
-I find one mistake, and...

111
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,917
-" I'm your Juliet and you're my Romeo"
-No issues, I'll redo it.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
"I'll take on the colours of your life"

113
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:19,500
"No matter what, we'll
never stay apart."

114
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,458
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

115
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,750
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

116
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,583
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

117
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,833
Aditi!

118
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,083
I don't want my son to Romeo
around with your daughter.

119
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:46,333
That's why I want them to be siblings.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,583
-Was that original?
-No, read it on Whatsapp.

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,458
"Life is incomplete without you"

122
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,042
"Nothing else matters without you"

123
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,583
"If you wish, weekdays will be at home."

124
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,667
"If you wish, I'll leave
the world for you."

125
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,000
"If you wish, I'll
turn days into nights"

126
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:20,417
"No matter what, we'll
never stay apart."

127
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,417
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

128
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:29,000
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

129
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,333
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

130
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:38,417
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

131
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:51,375
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

132
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:56,000
-"This is how we met"
-"Here we are now forever"

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,542
"Here we are now forever"

134
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,292
You know what?

135
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,708
You decide...

136
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,042
...whether you want to settle
in the US or get married?

137
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,000
Both are possible sir,
only if you consent.

138
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,250
The vacancy is for a senior position.

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,292
I know, sir..

140
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,667
Crap!
Sorry.

141
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,000
Take it.

142
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,708
No sir, it's okay.

143
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,958
Sir, I'm aware that the vacancy
is for a senior position.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,708
But how would they know
that he is a junior?

145
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,583
He does half of my work,

146
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,750
and you've already seen his talent.

147
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,000
You'll get no complaints, sir.

148
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,583
This is what happens when you
recruit from your college.

149
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,417
You guys try to take advantage!

150
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,042
Is it important?

151
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,500
It's dad.

152
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,167
Take it.

153
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:13,375
-No sir, it's okay.
-When elders call, you answer.

154
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,125
Bad news never announces itself.

155
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,542
Yes sir. Excuse me.

156
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,125
Sir, should I speak to the US office?

157
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,583
Sir, settling there is our only option.

158
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:31,792
You already know, how
it is with our families.

159
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,417
It's too complicated.

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,250
- And don't stress it.
- Yes, dad.

161
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,625
-Then grab the first fight and come.
-Yes.

162
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,792
Then I'll tell you what it is.

163
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
-Yes, dad.
-Got it?

164
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,083
- Your blessings.
- Blessed.

165
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,083
What could I have done if
dad didn't tell me anything?

166
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:56,417
You mustn't have asked properly, Sanju.

167
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,875
Boss is ready to help. We
can't take him for granted.

168
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,000
Even if we don't go
to the US, it's okay.

169
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,708
This time, I'll go home and tell...

170
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,292
...them to stop looking for
wedding proposals for me.

171
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,333
Because my roommate is not a random Bablu from
Kanpur, but a pretty princess from Jaipur.

172
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,125
Okay?

173
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,875
-Don't you want to marry me?
-Don't you want to stay alive?

174
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,167
Oh man!

175
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,042
They're just my parents.
They'll come around, not behead us.

176
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,583
-Try speaking to your folks too.
-Don't you expect that from me.

177
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,875
Dad despises love
marriages even in movies.

178
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,042
-He cheers in the Titanic only when...
-when Jack is dying.

179
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,792
I'm aware.

180
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,000
Aditi!

181
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,250
Chhotu.

182
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,042
So buddy!

183
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,917
Why the long face?

184
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,333
You look as shaky as a Peepal leaf.

185
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:18,125
You'll have to wait a while.

186
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,875
You didn't even ask me
what I pinched for you.

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,667
Wanna know?

188
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,500
A bat for you.

189
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,042
A gorgeous Kanjeevaram Sari for mom...

190
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,208
...an exquisite Titan watches
for dad, grandpa and uncle.

191
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,750
-And for your elder sister...
-Listen brother...

192
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,625
...don't utter her name at home.

193
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,458
Why?

194
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,500
You remember Arpit?

195
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,583
Satyanarayan's son.

196
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,042
Yeah, the one who broke through
AIIMS in the first attempt.

197
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,875
He also broke through our family
honour in the very first attempt.

198
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,167
Arpit has eloped with our sister!

199
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,708
Why didn't you tell me?

200
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,833
I thought we'd get our hands
on them in a day or two.

201
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,292
Now shit's knee-deep so I'm
having to shine the torch.

202
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,917
Anyhow, it was your father's orders...

203
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:31,750
...to get you here and enlighten you.

204
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:36,708
What if you had eloped
with your girlfriend too?

205
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,750
Uncle is a prophet; he sees everything.

206
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,542
He's filed a case of
abduction already on the boy.

207
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,625
Mr Yadav is in deep doodoo.

208
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,250
But it's there's no
way to justify a case.

209
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,667
I'll speak to dad.

210
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,208
Don't you poke your nose in this.

211
00:13:56,292 --> 00:14:00,000
Uncle is fuming and Ganga is flowing.

212
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,458
You'll be blowing bubbles
when he drowns you.

213
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,083
Think of your own self.

214
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,542
If you've pinched a girl from the same
caste, speak up when you reach home.

215
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,583
If you haven't, just keep
nodding your head at the meeting.

216
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,667
Meeting?

217
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,625
You want me to spill all
the beans right here?

218
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,458
Let's go home.

219
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,458
Come.

220
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,250
So..

221
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,875
We're done.

222
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,375
Shall we?

223
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,750
Come.

224
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
-Here.
-Oh how much will you feed us?

225
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,000
We'll be carrying the fat till next winter!

226
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,708
Please eat.

227
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,792
Mom!

228
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,208
This is...
my son, Sanju.

229
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,625
Take his blessings too.

230
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,083
What a dapper boy!

231
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,583
These days, we get photos of
boys looking like movie stars ...

232
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,250
... but what you find...

233
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,958
...a clown in reality.

234
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,000
Exactly.

235
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,875
And I repeat...

236
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,750
...being from the premium institute,
you must aim higher.

237
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,625
Apply for administrative services.
If you break through,...

238
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,375
...you'd command over the region, right?

239
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,917
Who am I to comment...

240
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,875
... on your well-read, well-bred boy?
He's handsome too.

241
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,375
But if Rashmi does,
he might consider it.

242
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,917
It's come to my ears, these
two...What's it called?

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,208
Video chatting.

244
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:39,042
They've started chatting.

245
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,708
I've to excuse myself to the bathroom.

246
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,583
Look!

247
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:51,292
Look how coyly he shied away!

248
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,208
What's all this, mom?

249
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:09,958
There's something you must've
heard about the family.

250
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,958
This is my younger brother.

251
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:17,083
You must've heard about his daughter.

252
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,125
Let bygones be bygones.

253
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,333
But why?

254
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,458
Clearing such things up
with our own is necessary...

255
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,500
...before society starts
poking its sharp nose within.

256
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,542
Shambhu.

257
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,125
Rajput rituals aren't like clothes...

258
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,375
...thin polyester one day...

259
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,042
...and pure cotton the other.

260
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,542
We've prepared everything.

261
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,292
You just wait till we find her.

262
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,417
I'm sure you've seen...

263
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,875
the courtyard; downstairs.

264
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,292
We'll bury her pieces below.

265
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,542
Now I'm convinced...

266
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,833
...I'm marrying my daughter
in a family I can boast of.

267
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,667
Spoken like a true Rajput.

268
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:09,458
Dupe your own son into coming
home and trapping him, huh?

269
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,750
Incredible.

270
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,375
Like a sacrificial
lamb to the slaughter!

271
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,750
-Don't speak like that.
-Why not, mom?

272
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,167
We speak on the phone 10 times a day.

273
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,708
Not once did you mention
what dad is up to.

274
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,500
What could I have said?

275
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,333
What could you have--

276
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,875
Is there
someone else you like?

277
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:47,833
Twenty five lakh cash
Maruti Swift car...

278
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:51,583
...and four sets of gold. There you go.

279
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,875
Make it forty.

280
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,250
Upgrade the Swift into Dzire.

281
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,042
And seal the deal.

282
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,000
Uncle
how about a swanky SUV?.

283
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,875
Any special model, my lord?

284
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,833
In fact, how about I shift
aside and you take over?

285
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,792
Oh, let the boy be.

286
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,000
He's a child. Whichever
brand and colour he craves...

287
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,000
...it'll be on your doorstep.

288
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:18,625
Let's find the auspicious date for the
wedding now. Glad it's finally done.

289
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,542
So let's sweeten your mouth.
Great! Congratulations!

290
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,667
I don't want to get married.

291
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,208
Have some more..

292
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,958
Oh, do take it!

293
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,583
-Here you go!
-I don't want to get married.

294
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,875
-Why aren't you listening to me?
- Please don't be shy!

295
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,458
I don't want to marry
her. I like someone else.

296
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,500
Grandpa!
Grandpa-what are you doing?

297
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,625
By caste-...

298
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,333
...she belongs to the same one as ours.

299
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,083
Her father runs a huge business.

300
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,458
They have oodles of money,
a beautiful house in Delhi.

301
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,583
And the degree: Engineering,
MBA, university topper!

302
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,792
Her bank balance outweighs
what you would ask for dowry.

303
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,792
Put the gun down, please.
Help me, would you?

304
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,875
She belongs to our caste, grandpa.

305
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,000
Our caste. She's our caste.
Grandpa, she's our caste.

306
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,583
-Yes.
-She's our caste!.

307
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,667
She's our caste.

308
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,792
Quite cunning, the both of them.

309
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,375
Their phones are switched
off, out of reach.

310
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,625
But we're not in frocks too.
We'll nab them.

311
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,708
Your dad couldn't swallow
a morsel without Shweta.

312
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,000
And now...

313
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,208
...he's bent on hunting
down and killing her.

314
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,542
Never did she seem sad...

315
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,583
...nor upset.

316
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:52,375
It appears she's planned everything
very placidly.

317
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,125
The guy's a doctor, mom.

318
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,042
He'll keep a smile on her face.

319
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,625
Had he been from our caste,...

320
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,542
...dad would have been vying
to give him a Mercedes.

321
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,833
Don't worry, now.

322
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,042
Just eat.

323
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,750
I will stop worrying, son,...

324
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,875
...only when you speak
to Aditi's parents.

325
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,833
Then we'll come...

326
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,042
...to finalise the wedding date.

327
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,875
And then within a year or two...

328
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,625
...when our yard will be
bustling with your children...

329
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,625
...all will be fine.

330
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's see.

331
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,833
Hey!

332
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,625
This doesn't seem the kind
of place to drink juice.

333
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,333
She turns!

334
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,417
And where are you from?

335
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,708
Shri Ram Colony,
Jaipur, Rajasthan.

336
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,542
And if you want to see another day,
you'd better flee.

337
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,125
Hail Goddess!

338
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,667
AC in my Jaguar and 'paratha'.
Too much fun.

339
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,292
-Perfect date. Come.
-How are you, Aditi?

340
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,458
I'm fine.

341
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,083
-And who's this doofus?
-Doofus?

342
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,250
This doofus arrived quite before you.
So just fuck off!

343
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,958
How are you, brother?

344
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,333
And where will you be going, son?

345
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,333
Hope there's no rush.

346
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,625
Relax.

347
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,833
-Did you have anything?
-No, I'm not hungry.

348
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:40,167
-Brother, about Sneha...
-Finish your juice first.

349
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,417
Huh?

350
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,500
Juice.

351
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,042
Finish it.

352
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,833
Kolkata is a distant dream.

353
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,375
Tell Sneha that dad won't agree.

354
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,083
She's been dreaming
of IIM for years now.

355
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,500
You've seen all the hours
she's spent working for it.

356
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,500
O God!

357
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,042
How about bro-sissy carry on...

358
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,583
...and I'll take my leave.

359
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,708
Did I ask you?

360
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,500
Look, sister,...

361
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,917
...she's going nowhere.
It's as simple as that.

362
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,417
You're studied quite well
in Delhi, didn't you?

363
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:20,833
She'll adjust here,
as well as her dreams.

364
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,000
You tell me.

365
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,708
You're just spot on!

366
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,208
In fact, I'll go get a
t-shirt, saying 'I love Delhi'.

367
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,958
And you...

368
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,583
I'd like you to come meet
me someday without reason.

369
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,208
No?

370
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,000
Waiter!

371
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,625
Waiter!

372
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,583
That big gremlin among
the four small ones.

373
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,375
She's the one.
She splashed my face with drinks.

374
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,333
She's coming here.
If she says anything to you...

375
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:01,500
Bloody waiter!

376
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,417
First, he gets me the wrong drink.

377
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,667
Then...

378
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,292
...he prances in front of me.

379
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,042
She's drunk; she's lost it.

380
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,333
-I gave you the right drink.
-Shut up.

381
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:14,625
You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

382
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,208
The lanes of Delhi call
me its Meryl Streep.

383
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,917
-Even I become Rambo after two shots.
-Hey.

384
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,625
I'm saying...

385
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,375
Get her the drink.

386
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,625
-Come on.
-Two.

387
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,667
Get a couple.

388
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,917
Two.

389
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,375
-Now go.
-Go.

390
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,125
He could've done that...

391
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,917
...way before...

392
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,042
...but...

393
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,958
...all my rants fell on deaf ears.

394
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,167
But you came,...

395
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,917
... my knight in shining armour!

396
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,125
Who are you?

397
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,375
Never mind.

398
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,250
Oops.

399
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,458
You didn't even tell mom?

400
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:38,083
Mom's in a really bad place
after Shweta's eloping.

401
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:42,958
She'd be shattered if I
had told her the truth.

402
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,292
All she has is me now.

403
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:51,208
How can I abandon her in good
conscience and settle abroad?

404
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:58,292
It's impossible for you too.

405
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:03,167
For all we know, they'll pull away
Sneha's books and push her into marriage.

406
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,583
That's the way of the world, son.

407
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:23,292
Whatever has happened...

408
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,333
... will continue to happen

409
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,375
I'm tired, mom

410
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,375
I'm weary.

411
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:36,958
They have murdered my
desire to stay alive.

412
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:42,042
I am anyway, a Joker
in this house of cards.

413
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,083
The real players are these!

414
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,167
What do I do then?

415
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,125
Tell me.
Do I have a choice?

416
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,792
Do I?
Tell me.

417
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:57,542
No, right?

418
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,167
No!

419
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:12,500
If your journey took you through
the paved road of lies...

420
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:17,583
...why did you suffer
within the walls of truth?

421
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:22,292
Even God wore the cloak of lies
to hoodwink the forces of evil.

422
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,083
You forgot, my son!

423
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,125
How could you forget?

424
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:33,167
God!

425
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:38,417
Aditi.

426
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,125
I've got it!

427
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,375
-I've got it!
-What?

428
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:44,750
We'll hoodwink, beguile and prevail.

429
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,792
What a foolish idea, Sanju!
Handcuffs will be waiting for us.

430
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:53,083
If we prepare everything meticulously
chance of success is a hundred.

431
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,708
Aditi!

432
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,875
When will my actor buddies
from the theatre come useful?

433
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:03,292
If we give one shout, moms
and dads will be abundant.

434
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:05,250
Fine.

435
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,250
Let's try Walmart.

436
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,958
Maybe they'll give us a
discount on Mother's Day.

437
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:15,875
-Have a nice weekend.
-You too. I'll send you the slides...

438
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,208
-...by Monday.
-Okay.

439
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:19,667
Okay? See you.

440
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,667
Neither can we desert our family for
settling in the US,

441
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,917
...nor can we part ways.

442
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,917
Is there any other option you see?

443
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:08,417
We'll have to plan every detail.

444
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,417
Great!

445
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,417
That's great.

446
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:20,375
Just a minute, Aditi. Aditi, I love you.

447
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,583
"The mother's forged,
the father's fake,"

448
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:29,125
"But sky-high are the stakes"

449
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,458
"Tightening the pants
of fate, all loose,"

450
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:35,000
"Getting our heads off the noose"

451
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,000
So the plan is, there are
going to be two weddings.

452
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,042
First, you have to meet
Aditi's family as my dad...

453
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,083
...and then my family as her dad.

454
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,917
Hold on.

455
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:46,083
Why don't you get them to
meet each other directly?

456
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,667
Very simple.

457
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,083
It's not simple at all, sir.

458
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,875
The pinprick is caste. If this reaches
their ears, there's going to be murder.

459
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,583
Simple!

460
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,958
-I haven't got life insurance.
-Okay.

461
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,542
There's going to be murder!
That's how you pitch roles?

462
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,250
For your eternal love...

463
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,792
...I should put my head
under the guillotine?

464
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,500
Get executed!

465
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,292
Don't shit me.

466
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:18,458
You want an artist to paint a
Mona Lisa with his own blood?

467
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,708
Zubina,...

468
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:25,833
...well...

469
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,750
Well!

470
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:33,708
How long had I been craving such a role!

471
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,542
I swear by Stanislavski.

472
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:39,958
Layered.

473
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,208
Challenging.

474
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,042
Relevant.

475
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,167
So relevant.

476
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,542
-''It's a river of fire, we'll cross it drowning.''
-I will do it.

477
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,875
''It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning.''

478
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,583
-I did a runaway wedding too.
-Wow.

479
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,833
So you support love marriage then?

480
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,208
No.

481
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,875
Then fights broke out.
And we got divorced.

482
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,833
You shall meet the same fate.
Take my advice...

483
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,583
...and go for arranged marriage.
Best bet.

484
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,833
"Sending minions to test
our patience, oh lord,"

485
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:16,208
"Why do you trouble your devotee, god?"

486
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:19,625
"All horoscope are barriers... "

487
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,250
"Confusing us with their mumbo-jumbo"

488
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,083
"All the while pundit says no."

489
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,125
"This is a lost cause."

490
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,875
No traits align.

491
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:31,208
Punditji...

492
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:35,375
...all astro-crap, caste, creed, race...

493
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,500
...just take care of it.

494
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,292
Make a chart...

495
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:43,083
...such that people announce
it a match made in heaven.

496
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,750
-Okay.
-"Win over the pundit with cash."

497
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,708
Bless you.

498
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,667
Bharatpur?

499
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,792
-Dad's aunt lives there.
-Ajmer.

500
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,333
Nope, Uncle's married
his daughter there.

501
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,125
Your family's apparently
everywhere. You tell me.

502
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,167
Sikar.
There's no one in Sikar.

503
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,250
-Sure?
-Yes.

504
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,208
Uncle, when are you leaving for Jaipur?

505
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:06,583
This week

506
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,417
Yes, actually I wanted to
send some clothes for Sneha.

507
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:10,542
Oh I see.

508
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,542
- Yes.
- Then come to Mishra's shop.

509
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,667
-At Mishra's
-Yes, child.

510
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,083
Okay. When?

511
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,375
This Saturday.

512
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,500
Saturday? This Saturday?

513
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23,792
Sanju, we'll have to be
prepared by Saturday.

514
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,375
Tell me, have the both of you done it?

515
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:29,458
-Done what?
-Consummation, you know.

516
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,042
Yeah, long ago in college.

517
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:35,000
In college?
Love marriage is a test of self-will.

518
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,875
The one who can't keep
his urges in control...

519
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,625
...fails this test.

520
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:41,167
I won't be helping you.

521
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,833
That's right.

522
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,583
When will my theatre buddies help?

523
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,875
We're just meeting wack-jobs.

524
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:56,042
He got mad as if I had
consummated with his wife!

525
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,917
Next.

526
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:04,042
Let's give just a mother then.

527
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,500
Kill the father.

528
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,042
No.

529
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:15,125
With both parents,
it'll look more genuine.

530
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,292
There's an actor...

531
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,458
Look-wise, neither Rajput nor Jat.

532
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:35,250
He retired from acting long ago.

533
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,042
Seems passionate.

534
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,542
Was.

535
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:47,000
Played Dushasan on stage years ago.

536
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:52,500
He got so into character, that he pulled
off his co-actor's costume onstage.

537
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:56,500
She slapped him and stormed off.

538
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,750
Audience was enraged and
thrashed all the actors.

539
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,833
He became a laughing stock that night...

540
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,042
...and he hasn't been
seen on stage since.

541
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:10,208
I must appreciate your courage.

542
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,917
Thank you.

543
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:15,542
You know the issue, right?

544
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,833
My shop is
shuttered, buddy.

545
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,208
Sir,...

546
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,333
-...how long...
-I'm done.

547
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,875
Sir, till when will you let the
ghosts of your past haunt you?

548
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,500
Till when?

549
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,708
Even Lord Brahma once erred.
Right?

550
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,083
Once...

551
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:48,125
...even Jonty Rhodes
missed a catch once.

552
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:57,042
Even Guru Dutt made a flop film once.

553
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:00,667
No... Guru Dutt never made a flop film.
No.

554
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,167
To be honest sir,...

555
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:09,417
...the streets of Delhi theatres
are chattering about this role.

556
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,917
-Believe me.
-Yes sir.

557
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:15,083
Layered, challengin
and so relevant.

558
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,375
Exactly.

559
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:19,333
But we need an actor of your calibre.

560
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,625
Pure method actor...

561
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:25,083
...who'll immerse himself
into being our real father.

562
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,333
Sir, give acting another chance.

563
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,708
-You'll set the stage ablaze.
-Yes sir.

564
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,542
And then this photo...

565
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:37,500
...will look better here, right?

566
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,333
-Yes?
-Wow!

567
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,333
Legends.

568
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,250
-Who's playing the mother?
-What sir.

569
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,917
The mother?

570
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,292
"My drunk friend is a dynamite"

571
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:03,292
"My drunk friend is a dynamite"

572
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,917
This is who you brought?

573
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,667
-Zubina!
-Yes.

574
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,417
She's younger than me.

575
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,417
And she's taller too.

576
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,375
-How will she fit as my wife?
-Give it a chance, sir.

577
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,083
Wrong casting.
It's not going to work, I'm telling you.

578
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,375
Sir, just give it a try.

579
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,625
She'll fit perfectly.

580
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,833
Right under my shoe.

581
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:21,958
Trust me.

582
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,083
For a legend...

583
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,750
-...I needed the best.
- Exactly.

584
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,500
- Sir, Delhi calls her its Meryl Streep.
- Meryl Streep!

585
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,667
- Sanjay!
- My foot!

586
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,417
-Hi.
-You're 20 minutes late.

587
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,583
It takes a bit of time...

588
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,417
Welcome back to the club, sir.

589
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,167
I'm so excited...

590
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,417
I'm exhilarated.

591
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:44,875
What's up with him?

592
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,708
Nothing.
Shall we?

593
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:48,083
- Is there a problem?
- No problem.

594
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,000
Can there be a problem bigger than you?

595
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:53,542
-"It's a river of fire, we'll cross it drowning"
-What's with him?

596
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:57,167
"It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning."

597
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,417
Mishra, here's another.

598
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,375
What'd you call a woman flying a plane?

599
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:08,750
Tell me, what'd you call her?

600
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,125
You'll call her...

601
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,250
... a pilot!

602
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,958
-Didn't expect that, did you?
-Wow.

603
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,708
Hello, uncle.

604
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,417
Hello, child.

605
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,000
Hello, Mr Mishra. Hope you're well.

606
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:24,000
Hi Aditi. I'm fine.

607
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,250
This is Sneha's gift.

608
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,625
Okay.

609
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:29,167
Is the ticket booked?

610
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,125
Confirmed?

611
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,667
I always get a
confirmed ticket. Look.

612
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,417
Child...
Hey!

613
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:43,000
Irrespective of everything, you
insist on taking the sleeper.

614
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,458
Why's your Aditi earning for?

615
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,875
Tell him, Mr Mishra.

616
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,375
I always tell him to get an AC one.

617
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,542
But his hands are clenched.

618
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,292
He's only kidding.

619
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Here's your ticket.

620
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,708
I've booked AC for you!
AC.

621
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,167
AC!

622
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,833
But make sure you sit
right on your seat, okay?

623
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:04,875
If you sit on the wrong one,
they'll fine you five hundred.

624
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,083
Acting is not just appearances.

625
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,042
Wearing loads of makeup
and looking old!

626
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,708
There's some nuance to it. Some craft.

627
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,708
Sanjay, I'll handle myself.

628
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,042
Better see to him.

629
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:25,375
He's been rusting all these years.
Lying forgotten.

630
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,042
How dare she?
Did you see?

631
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:31,250
-He's rusted.
-Even if a lion ages...

632
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,458
...he never forgets the smell of prey.

633
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,667
This is all there is.

634
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,500
If you keep squabbling like this,
the train will reach Jaipur.

635
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:40,000
Uncle will get off and that's it.

636
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,750
I respect the talent you have.

637
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,583
I admire both of you
respect both of you greatly.

638
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,917
I'm concerned about you, mom and dad.
Dad, here!.

639
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,167
15?

640
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,667
Sit, please.

641
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,792
Seat number 15.

642
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:01,875
May I help you, uncle?

643
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,958
No, it's okay.

644
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,250
I'll handle it all, son.
Don't worry.

645
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,208
You can relax, son.

646
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,917
Trust me.

647
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,500
Bless you.

648
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,292
Don't skip your meals, okay?

649
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:18,917
I'll keep checking on you.

650
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,000
Okay?

651
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,375
Want to buy anything?

652
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,208
Time-pass items...

653
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,250
sixteen GB pen drive, thirty -two GB...

654
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,042
...for the journey or for time pass...
Uncle,...

655
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,208
Want it?

656
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,125
How much is it?

657
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,875
A hundred and fifty for thirty-two GB.

658
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,042
Save the hundred,
it won't last even fifty minutes!

659
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,708
Right?

660
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,833
Uncle, I'll go down to a hundred.

661
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:53,500
Shoo.

662
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,083
Sixteen GB pen drive, thirty -two GB...

663
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,750
He's no helpful Henry...

664
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:03,333
...to pawn off his items so cheaply.

665
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:07,292
Delhi's brimming with fakes.

666
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,375
Our Sikar's way better.

667
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,458
Anyway,...

668
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,542
...for a job earning a lakh...

669
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,292
...my son shifted to Delhi.

670
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,667
Then
for the love of our son...

671
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,417
...we shifted as well.

672
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,875
But it comes with its problems.

673
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:26,375
A boy as well educated as him finds
it tough to find someone suitable...

674
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,083
...for his marriage.

675
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:31,833
We've met seventy girls yet.

676
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,667
Some lack beauty.
Whereas the ones with beauty...

677
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,875
...seem morally conspicuous.

678
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,833
In all this pandemonium...

679
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,208
...the train to his marriage..

680
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,417
...is derailed.

681
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:56,125
Aditi your uncle is positively nuts.

682
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,083
He's sitting there, mute.

683
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:01,292
Just nodding
and staring into oblivion.

684
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,375
Zubina,...

685
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,542
...hope's still alive.

686
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,250
Just wreathe garlands of my praises.

687
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,125
I'll text you praiseworthy
feats of whiz kids.

688
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,417
It's not going to work.

689
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,042
That'll be of no help.

690
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,875
- Yes.
- Uncle is a little slow.

691
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,125
A little slow?

692
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,042
- He's not...
- Calm down

693
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,167
Zubina, play at the striker's end.

694
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,875
- Directly.
- Yes.

695
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,208
And don't forget...

696
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:26,125
...that uncle should
first utter of the proposal.

697
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,292
From his mouth.
Okay?

698
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,292
Yeah.

699
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,875
All the best.

700
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,208
Striker's end.

701
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,875
Some tea, brother?

702
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:40,500
That's it.

703
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,500
Some tea, brother?

704
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,125
Will you have some tea?

705
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:47,292
- Yes.
- It seems...

706
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,792
...you're from Rajasthan as well.

707
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,792
Jaipur.

708
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,750
Jaipur?

709
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:57,750
Then you must have our homely tea.

710
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,125
Here.

711
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,417
Here you go.

712
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,167
So?

713
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,250
Who's there in the family?

714
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,625
Well, my parents passed away.

715
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,000
And?

716
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:13,667
Brother...

717
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,208
...or sister?

718
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:16,917
Sister left for...

719
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,333
Left?

720
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,792
For her heavenly abode.

721
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,917
Then there are two girls.

722
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,792
Sneha and Aditi.

723
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,417
Aditi...

724
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,250
What a pretty name, right?

725
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,500
Yes.

726
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,458
This dress? It's for Sneha.

727
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,875
You sure love your nieces.

728
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,458
No doubt.

729
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,708
But this dress...

730
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,042
...is from Aditi...

731
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,167
-...for her sister.
-I see.

732
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,250
She works in Delhi.

733
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,667
-Delhi?
-Yes.

734
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,458
Her wedding train is also derailed.

735
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:52,458
These days
it's so tough to find a decent groom.

736
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,875
Yes.

737
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:03,708
Our stories are kind of similar, right?

738
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:06,583
- Yes.
- Oh no!

739
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,625
You're looking for a bride...

740
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,542
...and I'm looking for a groom.

741
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,083
How can our stories be similar?

742
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,583
Oh yes.

743
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,792
The lord...

744
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,958
...works in mysterious ways.

745
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,542
-How so?
-This problem...

746
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:30,042
...can be easily solved by us.

747
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,708
I don't quite follow.

748
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,167
What I mean,
my niece...

749
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:39,000
...with your son!

750
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:45,000
My son!

751
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,875
That means...

752
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:50,208
both our trains are on the same track!

753
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:53,417
Well,
I had booked a sleeper.

754
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,875
Aditi handed me an AC ticket.

755
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,542
-Fate!
-Fortune!

756
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,292
Indeed.

757
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,375
Sometimes I feel...

758
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,375
...matches aren't made in heaven.

759
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,875
They're made by people like us!

760
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:11,042
There is no doubt.

761
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,542
Yes.

762
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:18,083
"It's the testing time,
you've to come out winner."

763
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,542
Today's youth is unpredictable.

764
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:24,000
Your uncle's been calling
the boy's parents angels.

765
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,958
No more excuses.

766
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,583
Come home.
We've got to fix the wedding.

767
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:30,167
Are you hearing me?

768
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,000
The parents are angels. Doesn't mean...

769
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,125
...the boy will have a halo too.

770
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,792
Does uncle give a guarantee?

771
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,042
I'll look to it.

772
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:40,250
Don't argue, Aditi.

773
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,792
- Just take the next train home.
- But dad...

774
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,292
I'm not listening to you.

775
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:47,000
Quietly come home and get ready
for this alliance.

776
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,875
" It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning."

777
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,417
" It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning."

778
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:58,542
" It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning."

779
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,292
Your dad is not
completely evil.

780
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,167
Not evil, just afraid.

781
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,917
The restrictions he
put up in my childhood.

782
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:09,125
Don't ride your brother's bicycle.
Tie two ponies to school.

783
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:12,458
Pull your long socks up.
What will society whisper?

784
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:21,792
Even if I kill someone for once,
he'll forgive me.

785
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:25,000
But if he learns about us...

786
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:29,542
...the community's going to boycott
the family and then he'll come after us.

787
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,500
I think...

788
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:40,042
...we should shift
to the US after marriage.

789
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,042
It's safer.

790
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:52,500
If I'm in the US,
there'll be no one there for mom.

791
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,708
She gave her entire
life to dad's convenience.

792
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,542
The least we can do
is enliven her old age.

793
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,667
But here...

794
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,500
...both of them;
brother and uncle and here.

795
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:08,875
That's why I was thinking the other day.

796
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,250
Why not apply at the office
for a transfer to Bangalore?

797
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:16,250
Bangalore?

798
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:19,042
It's barely an hour
and a half by flight.

799
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:24,792
And God forbid, in any emergency...

800
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:27,000
...we can rush back easily.

801
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:32,458
And how long will Amay and Zubina
continue their charade as parents?

802
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:38,125
Point taken.

803
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,333
Got it!

804
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:51,000
Here.

805
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:52,167
What?

806
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:56,833
Planes keep crashing every now and then.

807
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,708
Even after the marriage...

808
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:02,125
...whenever this happens,...

809
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:06,292
...you tell your family
Sanju's parents died on that flight.

810
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:09,500
And I'll do ditto at my folks.

811
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,167
With Amay and Zubina's fake funerals,
this entire menagerie...

812
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,833
...will end, Aditi.

813
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:20,250
-What baloney, Sanju!
-Baloney?

814
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:21,750
It's perfect. Why not?

815
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,292
Listen,...

816
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,708
...after the wedding...

817
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,958
...we'll produce a beautiful
daughter like you...

818
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,375
...and stupefy your father.

819
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,583
And I mean it.

820
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,292
I do.

821
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:09,042
Why's the pundit taking his sweet time?

822
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:11,417
That's what he's here for.

823
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:15,042
Yes
the chart is already set.

824
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,625
What do you mean?

825
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,208
I mean...

826
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,917
...set the table, sis.

827
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,833
Sanju was saying...

828
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:31,750
...it's his marriage.

829
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,083
Why waste time on planets?

830
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:37,792
Matching random horoscopes?

831
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:40,000
Right, brother?

832
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,208
He's naive.

833
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,458
Just more rote book knowledge...

834
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:47,042
...and less of tradition.

835
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:49,458
You check.

836
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,000
Relax.

837
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,958
Yes.

838
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,667
My dad yearned for...

839
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,000
...the entirety of his life...

840
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:08,167
...to find two horoscopes
with zero flaws.

841
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,375
He helped make matches...

842
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,125
...until his death.

843
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:16,292
But he didn't find a single such couple.

844
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:22,792
Dad,
your dream is now true.

845
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,583
Such astounding and...

846
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,667
...miraculous horoscopes!

847
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,000
What?

848
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:29,833
What are you looking at me for?

849
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,333
Start preparing for the wedding!

850
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:34,792
Miraculous. Beautiful.

851
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,708
Son,
this is Aditi.

852
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,833
Hello!

853
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:44,875
She's made this herself.

854
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,042
-I see.
-Wow.

855
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:49,167
-Take it.
-No.

856
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:52,125
What do you do?

857
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:53,917
She has a job in Delhi.

858
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,292
If you take issue with it,
she has no qualms quitting.

859
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:57,583
Wow.

860
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,333
Yeah, she'll quit.

861
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,750
Anyhow, she knows how to work a stove.

862
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:04,500
She multitasks easily.

863
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:05,833
Take a seat, child.

864
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:07,958
- It's all set, then.
- Bittu, keep it here.

865
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:09,708
We love her.

866
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:13,125
God blesses his true devotees.

867
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,958
And we don't want any dowry.

868
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:19,250
The one who's been blessed by above...

869
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:21,125
...needn't ask for anything more.

870
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,083
Great.

871
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,708
Aunty, do you take
trips to Jaipur often?

872
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:27,708
What?

873
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,083
No, to aunty...

874
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,833
No, son.

875
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:33,375
It's my first visit here.

876
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:36,458
My gratitude to your uncle.

877
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:41,167
Around Hauz Khas in Delhi?

878
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:44,500
Hauz Khas?

879
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:48,542
Is it a place? In Delhi?

880
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:52,250
It's the first time
I'm hearing the name.

881
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:53,750
Right?

882
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,917
- You...
- Why do you ask?

883
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,333
Dad, she looks familiar.

884
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:00,500
Must be a misunderstanding.

885
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:01,750
- I saw her...
- Quiet!

886
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,333
-Quiet.
-Brother sir...

887
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,625
Brother sir...

888
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:06,083
...we'll leave.

889
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:07,167
Leaving? But how?

890
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,000
No, brother sir...

891
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:10,875
...I have arthritis.

892
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:14,375
My joints jam if I sit for too long.

893
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,708
Wedding's fixed. We'll leave now.

894
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:20,708
Dad! They haven't even talked yet!

895
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,292
What need?

896
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,417
These two are ready already.

897
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:26,708
Already?

898
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,167
Already?

899
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:33,458
- I mean to say...
- She means...

900
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:36,708
...with all of your blessings...

901
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:40,208
...and consent,
they will be totally willing.

902
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,375
-Right?
-How can kids refute...

903
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,167
...what their elders
have decided for them?

904
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,292
All right then
this wedding is fixed.

905
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,792
Did you see, brother-in-law?

906
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,375
A family of angels.

907
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,625
No Jatt qualities.

908
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:55,875
Truly.

909
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:58,792
Who can be a better
matchmaker than uncle?

910
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,250
Truly.

911
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,458
Rightly said.

912
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,292
What has the world come to?

913
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:12,667
Artists now lounge around in nightclubs!
That's the last straw!

914
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,333
It's a big problem, Aditi.

915
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,333
My parents are arriving on Monday.

916
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,958
What if Vivek calls
upon us again in Delhi?

917
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,083
Minimise Zubina's role.

918
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,292
- What?
- Yes.

919
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,375
There's no other option.

920
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,167
The lesser he sees you,
lesser the questions.

921
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,958
I disagree.
I disagree

922
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,500
-You want me to put my life on the line for her?
-I...

923
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,083
- I disagree.
- For her foolishness.

924
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:31,875
-Foolishness?
-Of course.

925
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,458
It's called bad luck.
Bad luck.

926
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:38,625
-Sanju listen to me, cut down her role.
-''They went to Jaipur for the first scene''

927
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,833
''The next role is in Bihar''

928
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:45,458
''New faces with different
different motives''

929
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:49,125
''A fake key opens the real lock''

930
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,292
''Give the paper''...

931
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,000
''Give the paper''...

932
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,083
...''launch name to fame''

933
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:59,833
''It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning''

934
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,833
Dad,
please don't mention any dowry.

935
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:06,125
- What we'll ask...
- She'll earn in a year...

936
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,583
...and save it. I know it; I remember.

937
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,208
Ring the bell.

938
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,833
So,
after the wedding...

939
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,833
...they'll stay here
in this house.

940
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:27,833
What do you think, Mr Singh?

941
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,583
You mean...

942
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,375
...you'll domesticate your son-in-law?

943
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:43,458
- Oh no...
- Then?

944
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,958
This house belongs to Sanjay now.

945
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:50,708
- Yes.
- We'll both be leaving for pilgrimages.

946
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:53,375
We'll barely be seen around.

947
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,875
- Right?
- Yes.

948
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,458
Of course.

949
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:59,042
Getting my drift, Mr Singh?

950
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:03,167
Good enough?

951
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:07,542
It's not much, just a hut.

952
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:10,875
It's all yours now.

953
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,708
They's Sanju's grandparents.

954
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,083
I wanted to say..

955
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:20,417
After they wed,
the house is theirs.

956
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:22,292
Yes.

957
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:26,042
We will be leaving for pilgrimages.

958
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,250
We'll barely be seen around.

959
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:40,125
First, the real entourage
of Sanjay Singh from Bihar...

960
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:42,375
...will come to Delhi.

961
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:45,417
After that, Sanjay Bhalotia...

962
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:48,042
-Bhalotia.
-Present here!

963
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:51,292
I'll bring my fake family
to Jaipur...

964
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:54,083
...where Aditi Karwasra
will wed in reality.

965
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:56,167
This is Aditi's real family.
Take a look.

966
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,667
But we need more than
just a pair of parents.

967
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,167
We need family, too.

968
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,417
That's when you guys come in.

969
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,708
''This is a gift that
fate has thrust in our hands.''

970
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,292
''On the weird beats of life''...

971
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:09,208
...'' we dance away''

972
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,750
''We'll roll the dice''...

973
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,583
...'' and see if it's
a win or a loss''...

974
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,417
...'' a ladder of help
or we'll get bit''...

975
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
...'' by a snake''

976
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,500
Can you try talking to Sanju?

977
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,500
He might just take you seriously.

978
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:25,750
Tell him, there's no other
option than to settle in the US.

979
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:28,250
Please.

980
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,250
Don't tell him I told you.

981
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,000
Okay.

982
00:54:33,042 --> 00:54:35,250
When you face our real relatives,...

983
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:38,000
...please speak as little as possible.

984
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:40,667
Okay.
Always remember,...

985
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,083
...if you can't convince them,...

986
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:44,250
...confuse them.

987
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,125
''It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning.''

988
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:51,125
''It's a river of fire,
we'll cross it drowning.''

989
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:52,917
Hold on.

990
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:55,375
-Who's getting married?
-She.

991
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,250
-So who'll get trolled?
-You.

992
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,958
Yo..

993
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:03,375
Sanju...

994
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:04,667
- Sir.
- Finished?

995
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,042
Yeah.

996
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:07,708
I'll get you one more, come.

997
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:09,250
Okay.
Drinks anyone?

998
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:10,792
Drinks? Beer?

999
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,375
Beer.

1000
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,125
- No one?
- One more.

1001
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:16,625
So when is the flight?

1002
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,375
- Flight?
- There's still time.

1003
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,042
Excited, huh?

1004
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,167
No, sir.

1005
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:28,167
You know how things are.

1006
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:32,833
I'll be going home and
coming back here in two days.

1007
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,208
It's crazy.

1008
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,833
But she's really happy.

1009
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,458
Get her married every day
and she'll love every second.

1010
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,167
So, I have some good news for you.

1011
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,917
- Really?
- Yes.

1012
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,750
I was in touch with
the Bangalore office.

1013
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:55,750
And right before,
Aditi's confirmation came from Boston.

1014
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:00,542
- Boston?
- Yes.

1015
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:03,708
I mean everything
happened pretty quickly.

1016
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:06,542
And we were discussing
a project on Skype.

1017
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,333
...and...

1018
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,417
...you know how good she is, right?

1019
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,667
- So it's done.
- Yeah I...

1020
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,875
Without an interview? I mean...

1021
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,583
- How?
- I put in a word for you as well.

1022
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,083
It'll all be set.

1023
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,417
Frankly speaking,...

1024
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,125
...given your circumstances...

1025
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,708
...I think going to
the US is the best option.

1026
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,000
What's here anyway?

1027
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:35,333
Right?

1028
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Right?

1029
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:39,125
Right?

1030
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:41,917
I'll get this.

1031
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:00,667
Everyone's waiting
eagerly for your stories.

1032
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,375
There's still time
for the flight, right?

1033
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,875
What are you doing?

1034
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:12,000
You're going off without saying farewell?
Won't the guys outside feel upset?

1035
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:17,083
It all premeditated, right?

1036
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:22,833
- What was?
- Please stop acting.

1037
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,167
Despite agreeing on Bangalore...

1038
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,042
...all this while you
were in contact with Boston!

1039
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:32,458
And it was boss whom you
sent to convince me, Aditi?

1040
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:38,458
- Sit down and we'll talk.
- We did talk, right?

1041
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:41,042
- No, we didn't.
- Then what was that?

1042
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:45,375
You were too emotional that day.

1043
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:49,542
Sanju, you were
difficult to reason with.

1044
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:51,792
- Difficult to reason with?
- Yes.

1045
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,167
- Really?
- You...

1046
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,583
Let's talk it out, Sanju.

1047
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:58,708
Sanju, storming off
suddenly is no solution...

1048
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:06,125
Bangalore is an hour
and a half away by flight.

1049
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:09,083
If they get even an inkling,
they'll be there instantly.

1050
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,458
Sanju, when we have a
getaway pass from all this...

1051
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:13,042
...why risk it at all?

1052
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:15,792
Because mom is left
alone after Shweta ran.

1053
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,292
If I shift to the US,...

1054
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:20,000
...how many times will
I be able to see her?

1055
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,333
Leaving the battleground is easy;
the fight is the test.

1056
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,125
And we talked about fighting together.

1057
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,500
Right?

1058
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:29,125
We'll invite mom to stay with us.

1059
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:31,458
And you think she'll uproot everything,
leave dad and come?

1060
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,125
- We're leaving everything too!
- It's easy for us!

1061
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,792
For her, everyone's equal;
equally important!

1062
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,958
Why can't you get this?

1063
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,500
Even the US is just a day far.

1064
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:42,667
Why would we tell her...

1065
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,000
- ...that we're in Boston?
- Aditi,...

1066
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,208
...if death is in our fortune
it'll follow us anywhere.

1067
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,667
Anywhere and everywhere.

1068
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,708
Guns and bullets are
easily available there.

1069
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:53,250
But your family
won't even clear the visa interview.

1070
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,167
Really?

1071
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:06,292
Sanju, I'm sorry.

1072
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,500
Listen.

1073
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,333
Listen...

1074
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,042
...we'll convince mom
and she'll consent.

1075
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:18,250
Guess you know my mother better than me?

1076
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:19,542
Right?

1077
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:23,167
-"The bridal heart sinks like a rock"
-Sanju.

1078
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,583
"May someone placate it now"

1079
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:29,667
- Let's go.
- "She calls to her henna-dyed hands"

1080
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,042
"To help give her a solution"

1081
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,417
"The groom is also conflicted"

1082
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,833
"Why does the thorn
of love prick us in pain"

1083
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:43,125
"The knot in our relations"

1084
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:47,625
"Needs to be untied by someone"

1085
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,625
Yes, my greetings.

1086
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,917
I can't hear-
There's pure chaos here!

1087
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,708
Yeah, because it's a wedding house!

1088
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:02,083
"The groom is here
bringing the bride riding a horse"

1089
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:05,542
"Get the turmeric
and we'll apply it really well"

1090
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:09,000
"The groom is here
bringing the bride riding a horse"

1091
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:13,625
"Get the turmeric
and we'll apply it really well"

1092
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:21,625
"My eyes are filled
with many dreams"

1093
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:25,000
"With the turmeric
I mix in blessings"

1094
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,417
"All the joys
in the world"

1095
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,875
"may my son
get them all"

1096
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:35,167
"Come smear this on him"

1097
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,708
"Let his clothes be
coloured with happiness"

1098
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:41,958
"Come all aunties"...

1099
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:45,583
.."shower him with blessings"

1100
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:48,875
"Turmeric paste, kohl
and vermillion"...

1101
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,125
"Turmeric paste, kohl
and vermillion"...

1102
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:53,125
"My son looks like Ram"

1103
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,417
"Sing away"

1104
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:58,833
"The groom will
bring the bride riding a horse"

1105
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:02,333
"Get the turmeric
and we'll apply it really well"

1106
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:05,667
"The groom will
bring the bride riding a horse"

1107
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,792
"Get the turmeric
and smear it really well"

1108
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,000
"Donning hope
the groom leaves"

1109
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:28,708
"Sing away"

1110
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:32,542
"Look at his face shine"

1111
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:35,417
"Sing away"

1112
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:41,542
"From playing on her lap
to getting married, his mother watches"

1113
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:48,875
"From feeding him blessings
to loving him his mother watches"

1114
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:53,042
"The groom will
bring the bride riding a horse"

1115
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,500
"Get the turmeric
and smear it really well"

1116
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,125
"The groom will"

1117
01:01:58,208 --> 01:01:59,875
"The groom will"

1118
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:04,000
"The groom will
bring the bride riding a horse"

1119
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:20,125
"The groom has arrived on
a horse to get his bride"

1120
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:23,708
Please come, o bride,
we wait eagerly"

1121
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:26,875
"The groom has arrived on
a horse to get his bride"

1122
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:30,458
"Please come, o bride,
we wait eagerly"

1123
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,875
"The groom has arrived on
a horse to get his bride"

1124
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:38,042
"Please come, o bride,
we wait eagerly"

1125
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:54,042
"The groom has arrived on
a horse to get his bride"

1126
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:57,458
"Please come, o bride,
we wait eagerly"

1127
01:02:57,542 --> 01:03:00,750
"The groom has arrived on
a horse to get his bride"

1128
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:03,458
- "Please come, o bride, we wait eagerly"
- Smile a little.

1129
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:06,250
It's our first marriage.
Photos will not turn out good.

1130
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:10,167
"All dressed up, guests wait eagerly"

1131
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:13,542
"The groom has arrived to get his bride"

1132
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:18,125
"All dressed up, guests wait eagerly"

1133
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:21,875
My child...

1134
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:28,042
...is leaving our nest!

1135
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,833
Apple of my eye!

1136
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:35,042
Oh good lord!

1137
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:37,875
God!

1138
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,500
Zubina, take it down a notch.

1139
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:44,000
I can't match your acting prowess.

1140
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,875
Quiet down.

1141
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,875
The band party has left and
she's still blowing her trumpet.

1142
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,167
Stop her, someone!

1143
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:53,792
Quiet down.

1144
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:56,708
-Hello.
-Have said your vows, little brother?

1145
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,542
Shweta!

1146
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:03,792
How's my sister-in-law doing?

1147
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,667
She's doing great.

1148
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:08,958
We work at the same office.

1149
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,542
Wow.

1150
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:13,958
Hope you don't bully
her around for chores?

1151
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:15,917
No, sister.

1152
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,917
Each time she cooks, I am
assigned to the dishwashing duty.

1153
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,792
Sanju,...

1154
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:28,583
...is she the one with whom
you chatted those late nights...

1155
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:31,083
...secretly under your blanket?

1156
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:32,833
You knew all along?

1157
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:35,250
-Her name's Aditi, right?
-Yes.

1158
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:38,667
I am your elder sister, remember?

1159
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:42,042
So I kept it to myself.

1160
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,875
I'm happy for you, brother.

1161
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:51,458
The girl you fell in love
with is from our caste.

1162
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,167
I feel ashamed that I
couldn't do anything for you.

1163
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:59,542
I'm no damsel in distress.

1164
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,833
Arpit keeps me very happy.

1165
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,875
You always stayed away from home.

1166
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:14,833
You wouldn't know their narrow
mentalities and hypocrisies. I did.

1167
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:19,833
There's no point sacrificing
your happiness for them.

1168
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:24,208
Sanju!

1169
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,500
-Come, brother.
-Right behind you.

1170
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,875
But...

1171
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,333
I'll be right with you.
Go on.

1172
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:37,917
-Hello, Sanju? Can you hear me?
-I'm here, sister.

1173
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:41,042
Chhotu came to call me.

1174
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:45,333
Mom's been worried sick about you.

1175
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,167
Tell her all is fine.

1176
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,917
Does James Bond ever get caught?

1177
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:59,500
And
tell Aditi that when I meet her...

1178
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:02,750
... she'd better hone her cooking.

1179
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,083
Sisters-in-law deserve
special treatment, right?

1180
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,375
Of course.
When are you arriving?

1181
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,125
I will, soon.

1182
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,625
There's a different story
behind this wedding too.

1183
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,333
I'll explain it all later.

1184
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,667
Take care. I need to go now.
We'll talk later.

1185
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:40,042
(cacophony of traditional welcome songs)

1186
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:55,208
Out of the way!
What is all this crowd?

1187
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:58,375
We must make the bride feel
welcome; not scare her.

1188
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,917
Driver,
roll down the windows.

1189
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,042
Darling
just two minutes.

1190
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:09,000
Not letting these busy bees
buzz around for you for long.

1191
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:20,208
"Ram and Sita
stand gracefully"

1192
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:26,083
..."on the doorstep, dear friend."

1193
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:37,583
"Ram and Sita
stand together"

1194
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:41,958
..."on the doorstep, dear friend"

1195
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:46,333
"Somebody wake me"...

1196
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:50,625
..."for I can't believe my eyes"

1197
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:56,958
"Your presence
illuminates all I can see"

1198
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:05,958
"The lights of the lamps
shimmer in your grace"

1199
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:12,292
"A new glow has spread in my house"

1200
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:16,667
"Joy glitters in my eyes"

1201
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,833
"What luck it of mine truly"

1202
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:24,125
"To have you between us"

1203
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:29,708
"The aroma of your presence"

1204
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:33,875
"pervades all I see"

1205
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:40,417
"What luck it of mine truly
to have you between us "

1206
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:48,792
"What luck it of mine truly
to have you between us "

1207
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:58,583
"In deep red colour"...

1208
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:03,625
..." you look ethereal"

1209
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:11,875
"This courtyard blooms lik
a meadow"

1210
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:15,292
"You step in"...

1211
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:20,125
..."with feet adorned
in vermillion"

1212
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:24,542
"I just can't hold"...

1213
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:28,792
..."my tears of joy; they trickle"

1214
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:34,667
"My eyes and lips"...

1215
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:38,375
..."seem contrary to each other"

1216
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:43,208
"My mind convinces the heart"...

1217
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:47,583
.."of forthcoming joys"

1218
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:52,083
"Your feet are getting washed"...

1219
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:57,042
..."by a stream of my tears"

1220
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:02,833
"Ram and Sita stand together"...

1221
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:07,292
..."the doorstep, o friend"

1222
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:11,542
"Somebody pinch me"...

1223
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:15,875
..."for I can't believe my luck"

1224
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:19,958
"Your arrival
brightened up the place"

1225
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:24,375
Arpit's house has been getting calls
from unknown numbers.

1226
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:27,375
Who is the caller?

1227
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:30,542
We're still figuring it out.
We'll get back to you.

1228
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,375
So what are you presenting
me your faces for?

1229
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,958
-Sorry, sir.
-Sorry? Get lost.

1230
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:38,042
Sister!
Dad's consented to send me to Kolkata.

1231
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,625
Oh wow!
Congratulations.

1232
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:44,750
Dad told me I should be thanking you.
When are you coming back home?

1233
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:48,875
Everyone's stressing about your wedding.
I'll be leaving for Kolkata soon.

1234
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:53,375
There's a huge workload at the office.
I'll come in three, four days.

1235
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,750
There'll be work everyday, sis.
It's not everyday you get married.

1236
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,500
I'll come soon.

1237
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:03,542
So I'll catch you later.
Okay, Sneha? Bye.

1238
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,917
(faking accent) Excuse me?

1239
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,917
There's a wedding at my house too.

1240
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,625
And people are murmuring
that the bride is late.

1241
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:39,958
When will she reach home?

1242
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,417
Tell me.

1243
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,917
She'll reach in a couple of days.

1244
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:48,292
Make sure the bride and the mother-in-law
don't keep talking constantly...

1245
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,667
...or she won't reach on time.

1246
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:54,542
Besides, it's the bride at fault here.

1247
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:56,458
She's busy huddling
with her mom-in-law...

1248
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:59,542
...forgetting she'll be
leaving in a day or two.

1249
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:06,125
I was so afraid of your rituals.

1250
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,208
But mom made it all look so easy.

1251
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,583
At the back of my mind,...

1252
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:23,625
...we had court marriage
and elopement as a backup.

1253
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:31,750
But everything happened so smoothly,
so nicely.

1254
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:37,125
Feels like a miracle, Sanju.

1255
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,667
Hey!

1256
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:47,750
I'm sorry.

1257
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,917
For the fight at the night party?

1258
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,875
-I may have overreacted a little.
-A little?

1259
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:57,625
Will some natural calamity befall us...

1260
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,500
... if you decide to stay
for the next couple days?

1261
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,458
But no!

1262
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:04,125
An important appraisal at work,

1263
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:06,958
If I take too many leaves, they
won't hesitate to leave me forever.

1264
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,542
He wants to become a big shot!

1265
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:12,125
Money holds more value
than real parents, right?

1266
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:16,167
-Ugh, this connection!
-What happened?

1267
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:19,792
She's getting us checked-in, mom.
Internet's down since the morning.

1268
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:23,792
Listen, mail me the details. I'll go down
to the cyber cafe and finish it.

1269
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,333
No one's leaving anywhere.

1270
01:13:25,417 --> 01:13:26,875
You barely have four hours.

1271
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:29,500
And even in those, he
wants to go wandering!

1272
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:33,833
Aditi, ring Chhotu up.
When will he come of use?

1273
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:37,333
(Mimicking mother) Aditi!
Call Chhotu, he'll get it done.

1274
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,875
Pintu print out coming through.

1275
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:47,458
Hand it over.

1276
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:50,708
What an antique machine.
I can see moss growing within the keys.

1277
01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:52,708
Get your shit together.

1278
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:01,208
What?

1279
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,833
Aditi Kar-

1280
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,583
Can't finish one job
without bothering me, huh?

1281
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:36,792
-Bark.
-I won't be barking, brother...

1282
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:38,750
...but biting.

1283
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:42,250
What did you think?
You consider all of us idiots!

1284
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:46,125
You faked the girl to be our caste
and brought her home?

1285
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:47,875
She hails from Jaipur, right?

1286
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:49,708
Different surname...

1287
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:52,750
-Brother, brother, let's talk about it.
-Relax.

1288
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:55,875
We'll be talking
at length at home, along with...

1289
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,667
...your dad, my dad,
grandpa and everybody.

1290
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:00,083
Buddy, listen to me.

1291
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:01,750
Where are you right now?

1292
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,875
Just on my way to your execution.

1293
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,750
Aditi!
Chhotu knows everything.

1294
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:08,625
Grab what you get your
hands on, we're leaving.

1295
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,250
What do you mean Chhotu knows?

1296
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:13,042
-Sanju!
- "Within the valleys of the mind"

1297
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:17,042
"my carriage of dreams in you"

1298
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,750
"in you"

1299
01:15:23,042 --> 01:15:25,333
"I see my green earth"

1300
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:29,000
"And my blue sky in you
in you"

1301
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,958
"in you"

1302
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:39,583
"You're the smile on my lips"

1303
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:44,083
" The tear of my eye is you"

1304
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:47,125
"is you"

1305
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:53,958
"In the lost lanes of time"

1306
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,542
"The familiar face is you"

1307
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,375
"is you"

1308
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:04,042
"Within the valleys of the mind"

1309
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,708
"my carriage of dreams"

1310
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,625
For Gurgaon?

1311
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:52,125
Sanju brother!

1312
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,667
For Gurgaon?

1313
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:56,375
Brother Sanju!

1314
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:01,875
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Sanju brother!

1315
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,167
Sanju brother!

1316
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:08,667
-Finally got my hands on you.
-Aditi, run!

1317
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,583
- Aditi, run! Run!
- Brother Sanju!

1318
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,958
Where are you running?
Sanju brother, where are you going?

1319
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,875
- Listen to me..
- Look, Chhotu...

1320
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:17,083
Where are you running, brother?
I didn't tell anyone anything.

1321
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:19,417
- I swear.
- Better speak the truth, Chhotu.

1322
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:22,458
Why would I lie, brother?

1323
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:26,042
Do you think that evil of me?

1324
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:29,125
After sister's elopement,
do you think I could...

1325
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:32,000
...afford to lose you too?

1326
01:17:33,667 --> 01:17:36,042
I'm truly not wicked brother.

1327
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:38,792
Come here.

1328
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:51,250
My heart's in the right place.
My lips were sealed. No one knows.

1329
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:58,042
Both of you need to
come to Aditi's home.

1330
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:02,083
Uncle and aunty are at her
place bubbling with anger.

1331
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:07,125
-My place?
-Yes.

1332
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:11,833
Initially, I had thought of blackmail
to extort some favours out of you.

1333
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:15,458
But this dweeb switched
off his phone and fled.

1334
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:17,583
Uncle was red in the face.

1335
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:19,500
He called her father.

1336
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:23,708
Uh, sister-in-law,
he is really your dad, right?

1337
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:28,083
Good god.

1338
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:30,875
He has no idea either.

1339
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:34,292
Uncle thought that it was a case
of abduction. Who'll tell him...

1340
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:36,458
... it is of fraud instead.

1341
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,750
I couldn't see them like that.

1342
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:43,875
So I got them here by flight.

1343
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:48,250
I knew you'd board a train
since you missed your flight.

1344
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,667
-I also knew...
-Alright, keep quiet now.

1345
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:58,208
What excuse do we give?

1346
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,458
Shall we kill our boss?

1347
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:03,583
Let's kill him.

1348
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:10,625
(friendly chattering)

1349
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:14,458
Move...

1350
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,875
- Brother-in-law!
- Sanjay!

1351
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:33,000
How are you?

1352
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,292
- I'm good, and you?
- I'm fine too.

1353
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,667
How about we take it inside?

1354
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,333
Let's sit inside.

1355
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:46,042
Is this seat already
booked by someone else?

1356
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,083
No.

1357
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:50,042
- No. No.
- Then sit.

1358
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:55,042
Okay, this works
fine too. No problem.

1359
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,833
-I'll be back.
-No.

1360
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,000
It'll be a moment.

1361
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:05,125
You seem flustered?

1362
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:07,125
-Me?
-Yes.

1363
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:12,667
-Why have you switched off your phones?
-Screw that, why is brother Vivek here?

1364
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,458
How would I know? He's right in my lap!

1365
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:16,167
- Where are Sanjay's mom and dad?
- In the room.

1366
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,250
Crap!

1367
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:18,417
Come inside.

1368
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,333
Go on, take it.

1369
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,458
Here you go.

1370
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,792
Your house is like mine now.

1371
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:27,042
So is your stress.
So hand over your stress to me.

1372
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:30,042
All your problems are mine now.

1373
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:32,125
- And your house...
- Well...

1374
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,958
...how's Aditi?

1375
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,500
Just ditto like you.

1376
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:37,917
Her phone's off too.
Buried in office work.

1377
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,042
Wonder..

1378
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:44,250
They'll make a great pair then.
Like two peas in a pod!

1379
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:48,583
Isn't your dear mother around?

1380
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:51,417
She's...

1381
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,958
She's gone to the beauty salon.

1382
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,917
Beauty salon?

1383
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:59,042
Why would she ever
need any beauty salon?

1384
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:03,292
What I mean is
her face betrays her age!

1385
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:07,333
Our boss passed away suddenly, mother.

1386
01:21:07,417 --> 01:21:08,833
Yes.

1387
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,917
It wouldn't have been
wise to miss the funeral.

1388
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,250
So, we had to...

1389
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:16,167
... leave earlier instead of
flying out in the evening.

1390
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,750
You mean...

1391
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,417
... fleeing without informing first.

1392
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,333
No, not at all, father.
I did tell Sanjay...

1393
01:21:24,417 --> 01:21:26,417
... to inform you first.

1394
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,292
But then he pointed out
that talk of death...

1395
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:32,875
... in a wedding house is a bad omen.

1396
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:36,500
Besides, he did tell
you about the appraisal.

1397
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:41,000
Now if the whole office turns up for the
funeral, and they notice our absence,...

1398
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:44,125
...it will affect our
increment also. Right, mother?

1399
01:21:44,542 --> 01:21:48,000
I'm sorry for hurting you.

1400
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:52,417
Sorry, father. Sorry, mother.

1401
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,458
I'll be taking your leave.

1402
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,167
- Yes.
- Come.

1403
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,375
Come.
Well...

1404
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:01,208
... say hello to your wife.

1405
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,667
I mean, give her my regards.

1406
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,750
-Sure. Regards.
-This way.

1407
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:09,208
Sanjay, consider me a sponge now.

1408
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,667
I'll absorb all your stress.

1409
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,875
So you can chill.

1410
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:32,625
Come.

1411
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:34,375
Come.

1412
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,875
Sanjay, who are they?

1413
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:41,042
They're from a clingy NGO.

1414
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,708
Keep your eyes off them.

1415
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:46,875
They are looking to
honeytrap donors like you.

1416
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:48,042
They're pretty persistent.

1417
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:50,292
- Then I'd better buzz off.
- Come.

1418
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:56,542
If this happens again,...

1419
01:22:57,625 --> 01:22:59,833
...not my mouth, but my shoes...

1420
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,625
... will be doing the talking.

1421
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,833
Absolutely and truly!

1422
01:23:06,917 --> 01:23:09,708
Are these the values
I've taught you, Aditi?

1423
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:12,875
You've got your
parents-in-law all bothered!

1424
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,375
Who disappears just like that?

1425
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:19,542
Come on, hold your ears.

1426
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:22,083
Apologize.

1427
01:23:22,167 --> 01:23:25,208
-Sorry, father.
-Sorry, father.

1428
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:31,208
So many degrees
and yet behaving like buffoons!

1429
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,875
Calm down, brother sir, calm down.

1430
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:36,042
It wasn't that big of a deal.

1431
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:40,542
On this pretext we will live with them
for another day or two.

1432
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:44,125
I was anyway reluctantly sending them.

1433
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:46,208
I had prayed to God...

1434
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:49,333
... to be able to take you to a
holy pilgrimage after marriage.

1435
01:23:49,417 --> 01:23:52,417
Since we've come all this way
no better time to do that too.

1436
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:54,708
Aditi?
You'll be coming, right?

1437
01:23:54,792 --> 01:23:57,667
We'll have a great time.

1438
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:02,417
The wedding's in five days in Jaipur.

1439
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,625
I'll have to fly there tomorrow
morning. Send them back.

1440
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,583
How can I just simply send them back?

1441
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:11,042
Do you sense what's cooking here?

1442
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:16,125
Our presence here
causing them great distress.

1443
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:19,792
Fine, keep them here.
They've planned a nice family holiday.

1444
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:21,500
How about we hand them
our new wedding card?

1445
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,292
We'll have a great time.

1446
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:25,417
Unbelievable.

1447
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:28,875
They're freshly married.

1448
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,250
We've come here as uninvited guests.

1449
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,625
Poor kids aren't able
to have a moment alone.

1450
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,167
Is that what your surmised?

1451
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,083
Now only God will help us.

1452
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:49,292
Meaning when he closes a door...

1453
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:52,000
... he opens two more!

1454
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:57,125
-What's going on?
-'What's happening, Aditi?'

1455
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:58,875
'Don't you want to get married?'

1456
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:01,958
'All relatives have arrived already.
And their questions are piling up.'

1457
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:03,583
'What do you expect me to say?'

1458
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:06,000
Papa, the train got
cancelled because of the fog,

1459
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:07,583
or I'd be there by now.

1460
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,542
Due to the fog?

1461
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:12,750
'First wedding in the family
and the bride is amiss!'

1462
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:14,542
Sorry, papa.

1463
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:17,083
'The only apology I need is
the one after you arrive.'

1464
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:18,792
Yes papa, I'll be there.

1465
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:19,875
-'Bye.'
-Okay.

1466
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:21,542
Ram Ram.

1467
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:27,500
'Sir, there's a phone number...'

1468
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:30,000
'... that keeps calling
the Arpit's family.'

1469
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:34,417
'The same number has been
calling Sanjay many times.'

1470
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:38,292
'Hope I'm making sense, sir?'

1471
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:51,750
Dad, I needed to talk
to you about something.

1472
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:54,833
Go ahead.

1473
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:58,083
Meenal, Aditi's childhood friend...

1474
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,250
...is getting married in Jaipur.

1475
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:02,083
You're calling her a friend?

1476
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:04,500
She's more like family.

1477
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:08,375
Meenal is another daughter to me.

1478
01:26:08,458 --> 01:26:09,708
For their wedding...

1479
01:26:09,792 --> 01:26:13,000
... she arrived a week in
advance to help around.

1480
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:16,000
If we don't go, father,
won't she feel bad?

1481
01:26:16,042 --> 01:26:18,292
Besides, the tickets are already booked.

1482
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:20,917
The money will go wasted otherwise.

1483
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:25,375
All right.
You can go.

1484
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:27,208
Thank you, father.

1485
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:31,292
Well do one more thing.

1486
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,833
Book two tickets more.

1487
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:42,667
I've never seen a Jaipur wedding before.

1488
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:50,167
But I... I thought mother wanted
to go to for her pilgrimage?

1489
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:54,417
I thought we'd attend the wedding, and
meanwhile, you can finish your pilgrimage.

1490
01:26:56,375 --> 01:27:00,958
Mother, a comfy car and a
hotel room are waiting for you.

1491
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,375
And you needn't even climb the mountain.

1492
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,792
A helicopter will fly you
directly up the mountain.

1493
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:07,250
- Directly?
- That's great.

1494
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:10,042
But son, it'd be way better if we had...

1495
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:12,125
...the both of you with us.
Isn't that right?

1496
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:15,458
- Yes, but...
- Oh, come on!

1497
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:18,667
Youngsters these days
aren't very fond of temples.

1498
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,500
Or are they?

1499
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:24,000
They want to go for a tour.

1500
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:25,875
Why stop them? You'll be
attending a wedding, right?

1501
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:27,625
Yes, we will.

1502
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,792
Okay.

1503
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:33,250
Father, I was thinking
I'll take Chhotu with us.

1504
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,417
He'll be more than happy
to see the Amer fort.

1505
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,375
-Chhotu?
-Yes.

1506
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:42,500
But if there's any...

1507
01:27:42,917 --> 01:27:44,500
No, its great.

1508
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:49,125
First, he speaks to Shweta on call.

1509
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,792
Then he runs away from home.

1510
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:55,250
And now he's running to attend
a wedding in Jaipur...

1511
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,750
... with daughter-in-law and Chhotu.

1512
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:02,833
Whose wedding bells are calling him
so loudly and urgently?

1513
01:28:03,417 --> 01:28:05,042
Are you getting the picture?

1514
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:07,417
'Yes, sir. Totally'

1515
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:16,292
I guess the ending of Shweta's
story will be in Jaipur.

1516
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,333
So gather your sniffing dogs.

1517
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:23,208
-'Okay, sir.'
-The hunt is ending.

1518
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:25,292
-Okay.
-Bye.

1519
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:35,750
"A knight riding a horse
Has come for his wedding"

1520
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:39,042
"We finally arrived with a smile
The bride's family, wait a while"

1521
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:42,375
"Marriage is a grand affair
Dance till you lose your hair"

1522
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:45,708
"Change the party, come to us
We got the orchestra"

1523
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:48,833
"Let the food turn cold
We'll finish it and all extra"

1524
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:52,208
"Keep the pundit on hold
We'll get him to recite the chants"

1525
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:55,542
"The groom is jittery
as if he'll get sacrificed"

1526
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:59,667
"Tell the queen
The king's here to get her"

1527
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:16,500
"An entourage is no
good if it's not late"

1528
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:22,875
"What's the hurry? Let them wait"

1529
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:28,583
"An entourage is no
good if it's not late"

1530
01:29:28,667 --> 01:29:31,708
"What's the hurry? Let them wait"

1531
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,667
"Very sorry
Sorry"

1532
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:38,500
"We'll dance away today"

1533
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:43,500
"We got the band with us...
Come make some noise"

1534
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:48,208
"Nobody should stop me today
Come make some noise"

1535
01:29:48,292 --> 01:29:51,583
"Please come, silly son-in-law"

1536
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:55,250
"Please come, silly son-in-law"

1537
01:29:56,083 --> 01:29:59,333
"Your mom-in-law
Your mom-in-law beckons"

1538
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:02,500
"Come over, I'll pamper you"

1539
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:08,208
"Your mom-in-law beckons
Come over, we'll enter grandly"

1540
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:22,583
"come make some noise."

1541
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:29,208
"come make some noise."

1542
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:34,250
"come make some noise."

1543
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,875
"A knight riding a horse
Has come for-"

1544
01:30:48,917 --> 01:30:51,000
What's wrong?

1545
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:54,375
"Scared? Lost
all your marbles now?"

1546
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,417
Brother-in-law!

1547
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:02,292
"Welcome to the family, brother-in-law"

1548
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,250
Welcome.

1549
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:05,708
Thank you, brother-in-law!

1550
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:07,042
"Come get up, get up"

1551
01:31:07,292 --> 01:31:09,875
-Don't you want to get it started?
-Where's the groom party from?

1552
01:31:10,917 --> 01:31:12,708
They're from Delhi.

1553
01:31:13,917 --> 01:31:15,875
Did you spot a distant relative?

1554
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,458
Greetings, madam.

1555
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,208
Is the groom your son?

1556
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:29,500
Or what? Is he yours?

1557
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,750
Is there some connection
you have with Bihar?

1558
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:41,583
Excuse me, fellow!
Are you a man or a maths book?

1559
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:43,042
Why so many questions?

1560
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:47,250
Go check why the DJ isn't
playing a bollywood number.

1561
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,750
Choose an item number. Go now.

1562
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:15,500
'The GPS is on, sir'
'Triangulation is working as well.'

1563
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,292
'I've held the police there.'

1564
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:20,333
'They'll be ready to
go at your command.'

1565
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:22,417
Step on the accelerator.

1566
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,417
Sanju will never lie to me.

1567
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,417
I say with conviction that
it's a friend's wedding.

1568
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:32,458
When you see Shweta...

1569
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:35,542
... ready to be married...

1570
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:37,292
... you'll know...

1571
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:41,500
... how royally your son and
daughter-in-law have screwed you over.

1572
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:44,250
'Hello.'

1573
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:45,875
Hello sir.

1574
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:48,500
-This is Mishra speaking.
-Mishra who?

1575
01:32:49,167 --> 01:32:50,708
'Jayant Mishra, sir.'

1576
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:53,375
I had booked tickets
for your son's wedding.

1577
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:55,625
Alright, go on.

1578
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:57,667
I needed a favour from you, sir.

1579
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,542
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1580
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:03,833
What are they doing?

1581
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:06,000
Marrying in every house?

1582
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:08,625
They're same.

1583
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,000
Vivek!

1584
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:15,208
-Police stopped us when were leaving...
-Vivek!

1585
01:33:15,542 --> 01:33:18,833
- Vivek...
- ... and I said "Bullet or blows?

1586
01:33:18,917 --> 01:33:21,000
Mr. Mishra has appeared!

1587
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:25,958
All liquor is waiting upstairs.

1588
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:27,583
Go have a quick sip or two quickly...

1589
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:30,000
...or else don't complain
about being duped later!

1590
01:33:30,292 --> 01:33:33,542
You're the one being duped tonight.

1591
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,250
I didn't get it.

1592
01:33:36,542 --> 01:33:38,792
May I speak freely, sister-in-law?
Don't hit me.

1593
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:41,708
Your younger sister is
looking like a heart-stealer.

1594
01:33:41,833 --> 01:33:43,167
How about you introduce us?

1595
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

1596
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:49,375
Yes, son. What is it?
Speak now.

1597
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:53,125
Do you see what game
your daughter is playing?

1598
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,250
Aditi, who's that man?

1599
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:02,500
-Which man?
-The one talking to your dad and brother.

1600
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,583
He's not from the office team.

1601
01:34:04,667 --> 01:34:05,750
Why does it feel that
I've seen him somewhere?

1602
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:08,917
Why would he seem familiar to you?
He's a friend of uncle's.

1603
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:12,125
Aditi, I've met him somewhere before.

1604
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:15,417
The chump was questioning
Miss Zubina a lot too.

1605
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,167
- Is it?
- Yes.

1606
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:21,250
He runs a small travel agency
outside the railway station.

1607
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:24,042
-Mishra Tours and Travels?
-Yes.

1608
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:29,292
Your journey with ease, for a low fees.

1609
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,250
Oh no!

1610
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:38,167
Father booked tickets from
him for our first wedding.

1611
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:41,083
-What?
-Everything's ruined.

1612
01:34:41,958 --> 01:34:43,375
Everything.

1613
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:47,417
All these guests
all this money.

1614
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:51,958
Our family's honour is in the dirt!

1615
01:34:53,875 --> 01:34:57,167
What face shall I show to my
foreign business associates?

1616
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,167
Brother-in-law, give it a calm thought.

1617
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:02,458
What would have people said in the
village if they had eloped secretly?

1618
01:35:02,542 --> 01:35:04,500
They did this keeping you in mind...

1619
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:07,500
... so you could wed them yourself.

1620
01:35:07,583 --> 01:35:09,500
You were the one who
brought the proposal, right?

1621
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:13,083
Who can be a better
matchmaker than uncle?

1622
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,167
-You..
-Not now, dad.

1623
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:19,833
Dad is boiling with anger, guys.
Mishra told him everything.

1624
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:22,750
It's fortunate that we have some
bullets left after the entrance.

1625
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:24,875
They'll be useful now.

1626
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:28,125
Mr Mishra and uncle
wait here...

1627
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:30,667
... and keep an eye on everyone.
Nobody must go anywhere.

1628
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,250
Chhotu...

1629
01:35:32,417 --> 01:35:34,625
... get the office people on board
and tell them to abort the mission.

1630
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:36,125
Run, Chhotu.

1631
01:35:36,292 --> 01:35:37,333
Bittu, where are they bullets?

1632
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:39,417
Upstairs.
In room 208.

1633
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,417
Come.
Let's go, dad.

1634
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:43,375
Come on.

1635
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:58,708
If you value your life, run.

1636
01:35:59,042 --> 01:36:00,208
Run immediately.

1637
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:02,875
First, let's evacuate
the guests one by one.

1638
01:36:03,167 --> 01:36:05,167
Then we'll deal with them.

1639
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:07,833
What will our family elders say?

1640
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,708
No one has ever seen such
a scandal in our family.

1641
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:13,958
We'll settle the scores today, dad.

1642
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
We won't let them die out so easily.

1643
01:36:17,542 --> 01:36:19,042
Let's go.

1644
01:36:20,417 --> 01:36:22,417
The groom's mother is missing.

1645
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,042
She has a whole different story, dad.

1646
01:36:25,333 --> 01:36:28,458
-We'll kill her first.
-Kill anyone you want.

1647
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:30,292
But don't touch Aditi.

1648
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:32,458
There's something worse waiting for her.

1649
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:36,542
-Where are they?
-I don't see anyone.

1650
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:41,250
Come on.
Come fast.

1651
01:36:43,458 --> 01:36:46,083
-Hey.
-There.

1652
01:36:53,958 --> 01:36:55,292
Dad!

1653
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,708
Clingy NGO people?

1654
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,625
Come here, you.

1655
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:33,833
-Fill this up.
-No, mister.

1656
01:37:33,917 --> 01:37:35,083
It's not allowed to fill it up.

1657
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:37,375
I'll advise you to fill
the car up instead.

1658
01:37:38,208 --> 01:37:39,500
Come here.

1659
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:42,500
What is it? Not getting
through your skull?

1660
01:37:45,792 --> 01:37:47,000
How much should I fill?

1661
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:49,000
I have to set ten to
twelve people on fire.

1662
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:51,125
Fill it up accordingly.

1663
01:37:51,417 --> 01:37:55,125
Have you seen the open gutter
at the back of the highway?

1664
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:59,125
That's where I'll throw
your chopped pieces.

1665
01:37:59,292 --> 01:38:02,042
You won't be doing anything.
It'll be us who'll take the real action.

1666
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:06,000
Your sister has driven
my name in the sewer.

1667
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:07,833
I will feed her to the dogs.

1668
01:38:07,917 --> 01:38:10,583
-Hey old man! I'll shoot him right now, dad.
-Vivek, wait.

1669
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:12,917
Just because you have a
pistol doesn't mean...

1670
01:38:13,042 --> 01:38:13,875
... you can whip it around mindlessly.

1671
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:15,625
- Uncle...
- Quiet!

1672
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:17,958
- I'll deal with her later.

1673
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:20,125
Take whatever action
you want against me.

1674
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:22,083
But please let Sanju go unscathed.

1675
01:38:22,167 --> 01:38:24,875
He didn't run away.
He did all this for your sake.

1676
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:27,833
-Shut up!
-Consider it delicately...

1677
01:38:28,292 --> 01:38:30,542
... before Vivek does
something you later regret.

1678
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:32,333
Dad!

1679
01:38:32,417 --> 01:38:35,833
At your own will, you married
a guy of another caste?

1680
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:39,458
What had you thought coming here?
That we'll never learn the truth?

1681
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:41,583
Vivek...

1682
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,792
...set the boy and
his fake father on fire

1683
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:44,875
Hey!

1684
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:46,750
Lock Aditi up in a room.

1685
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:48,500
We'll keep her locked
up for a few weeks.

1686
01:38:48,583 --> 01:38:50,208
Then we'll get her married again.

1687
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:52,292
Nobody will ever hear of it.

1688
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:53,958
We'll keep our honour intact.

1689
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,208
But I'm married already. Isn't it, dad.
This is the second time.

1690
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,125
Exactly. This is a repeat telecast.

1691
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:02,958
The real game has been played
in Delhi with uncle's presence.

1692
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,083
Shut up!

1693
01:39:04,167 --> 01:39:06,458
Even if you get me married again...

1694
01:39:06,542 --> 01:39:08,250
... do you really think
I'll keep my mouth shut?

1695
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:10,167
- You...
- Unbelievable.

1696
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:14,333
- How she blabbers such filth!

1697
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:17,958
There's only one way out. Chop them
into pieces and throw them away.

1698
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,875
-Don't talk nonsense!
-Quiet!

1699
01:39:20,167 --> 01:39:23,167
Start making the guests leave.
Then we'll see to all of them.

1700
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:25,500
-And how will you answer their questions?
-Keep your mouth shut!

1701
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:28,333
Why should she? We don't see
anything wrong in what we did.

1702
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:30,292
And when the questions
begin to pile up...

1703
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:32,083
... about aborting the pompous
ceremony all of a sudden...

1704
01:39:32,167 --> 01:39:34,000
... what shall you say?

1705
01:39:34,042 --> 01:39:36,292
What will you say, dad?

1706
01:39:36,542 --> 01:39:38,458
Tell us, dad.

1707
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:45,417
The both of you,
come with me.

1708
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:47,167
Where?

1709
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:50,667
You will tell everyone...

1710
01:39:50,875 --> 01:39:52,792
...that your son is of unsound mind.

1711
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:54,000
- Who's son is of unsound mind?

1712
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:56,000
Hence the bride party
calls off the wedding.

1713
01:39:56,042 --> 01:39:57,333
Who's son is of unsound mind?

1714
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:00,542
Dear in-law, I'd urge you
to think this through.

1715
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:03,833
If the guests leave
on an empty stomach...

1716
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,708
... they will resort
to chattering rumours.

1717
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:10,000
Yes, people will talk behind your back.

1718
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:14,708
Some might say that maybe
your dowry was insufficient.

1719
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:17,417
Questions shall be splashed
on Aditi's character.

1720
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,875
Bittu, pour the petrol
on the boy's father.

1721
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:20,750
- No, wait!
- Stop!

1722
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:22,583
- Hold on!
- Stop it!

1723
01:40:22,667 --> 01:40:26,042
Dear in-law, kindly contemplate coolly.
Think what it was that you wanted.

1724
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:30,625
That the kids marry into good,
prosperous families. They remain happy.

1725
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:33,542
The ceremony is grand and pompous.

1726
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:36,458
That's exactly what's happening.
Then why all this ruckus?

1727
01:40:36,583 --> 01:40:40,083
Look around you. People are
licking their fingers lavishly.

1728
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:41,833
Everyone's contented.

1729
01:40:41,917 --> 01:40:44,000
Yes, uncle. Ask my uncle...

1730
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:47,000
... what chaos ensues
after a daughter's scandal.

1731
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:48,792
-You...
-Uncle...

1732
01:40:48,958 --> 01:40:50,875
- You're dead meat.
- Dad! No, dad!

1733
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:52,250
Dad...

1734
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:56,083
... put the gun down.
Lower it, please. Lower it.

1735
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:58,333
Just think about it.

1736
01:40:58,417 --> 01:41:01,458
If they had wished, they'd
eloped long ago like us.

1737
01:41:01,542 --> 01:41:03,833
What could you done then?
Nothing! Couldn't have even found them.

1738
01:41:03,917 --> 01:41:06,000
Even after all of it, they're bent...

1739
01:41:06,042 --> 01:41:08,833
... marrying as per your customs
just so they see you happy.

1740
01:41:08,917 --> 01:41:10,833
Why are you wasting your energy, sister?

1741
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:13,833
Their vision is polluted
by the lenses of society.

1742
01:41:13,917 --> 01:41:16,958
All that matters to them
is what people say about them...

1743
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,125
... even if it means ruining our lives.

1744
01:41:19,208 --> 01:41:21,000
Kill all of them!

1745
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:22,542
Conclude it all.

1746
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:26,083
Pump them with bullets. Set them ablaze.
Incinerate the whole family.

1747
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:30,583
And then sit with your pride
all alone in your mansion.

1748
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:39,167
You've lived out more than
half of your life, dad.

1749
01:41:40,042 --> 01:41:42,000
But ours is just beginning.

1750
01:41:42,042 --> 01:41:44,750
Don't you want your own
children to be happy?

1751
01:41:57,958 --> 01:42:00,292
What drama is this?

1752
01:42:00,417 --> 01:42:02,208
Oh leave it! Bittu, pour
the petrol on his parents.

1753
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:05,500
Yes, but on the real ones or the fake ones?

1754
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,583
Where's everyone vanished?

1755
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:15,667
Did some guest get
popped during the firing?

1756
01:42:16,167 --> 01:42:17,667
Very possible.

1757
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:20,125
At Varsha's wedding, it was
the groom who got blasted.

1758
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:21,792
-What?
-Yes.

1759
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,750
Did you hear?

1760
01:42:24,042 --> 01:42:27,208
At Varsha's wedding, it was
the groom who got blasted.

1761
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,167
Vivek, you don't need to do this.

1762
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,875
-We'll sit down and talk it out.
-Bittu.

1763
01:42:30,958 --> 01:42:32,542
-What are you doing?
-Move.

1764
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:33,833
Hey! What are you doing?

1765
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:35,458
- Stop!
- Someone stop him!

1766
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:37,958
-Sanjay!
-What insanity is this?

1767
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,750
People'll chatter for a couple of days.

1768
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,875
Then it'll fade away. They'll
forget; it's what happens.

1769
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:44,292
-That's what will happen.
-And if you get caught?

1770
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,333
-If you get caught, they'll hang you all, dad.
-They're lying.

1771
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:50,042
Your foreign investors will repel
you. They'll dispose of your business.

1772
01:42:50,125 --> 01:42:52,000
Think calmly, dad.

1773
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:55,875
Hashtag 'Boycott Karwasra Industries'
will trend on Social media.

1774
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:57,208
What refuge will you have then?

1775
01:42:57,292 --> 01:42:59,667
You'll be surrounded by human rights
activists banning your business.

1776
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:01,625
-Bittu, light the fire.
-Hey! Vivek, stop...

1777
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,583
- He has lost his marbles.
- What are you all doing?

1778
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:06,375
And if the news about me and
Sanjay gets leaked even slightly...

1779
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:08,083
...who'll marry Sneha?

1780
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:09,958
She's right, dad.

1781
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,708
And since you won't be
able to get me married...

1782
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:14,625
...set me ablaze as well.

1783
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:15,667
Shut up!

1784
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,042
They're trying to manipulate us
to prove themselves right, dad!

1785
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:20,500
Brother-in-law, try to
get the bigger picture.

1786
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:24,167
Even if you kill us
you'll still lose face.

1787
01:43:24,458 --> 01:43:27,333
Let everything happen
just as it is happening right now...

1788
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:28,875
... and you'll walk
with your honour intact.

1789
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:32,458
And if your honour is
unharmed, then why the killing?

1790
01:43:32,875 --> 01:43:36,750
Let things run as smoothly
as they already are, dad.

1791
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:39,042
Everyone will be happy.

1792
01:43:39,208 --> 01:43:40,833
Business and honour, both will be safe.

1793
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:42,125
-Don't let them fool you, dad.
-Shut up!

1794
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:43,958
- Quiet down!
- Don't listen to them, please.

1795
01:43:44,042 --> 01:43:45,458
Lower the gun.

1796
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,458
Lower it.

1797
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:55,750
What's the matter, Dharampal?
Why've the wedding rituals stopped?

1798
01:43:56,792 --> 01:43:58,375
Hope nothing unseemly has happened?

1799
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:01,000
If there's some hitch, tell you uncle.

1800
01:44:02,417 --> 01:44:05,792
He's drenched in petrol.

1801
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:09,125
-Is this some sort of hobby?
-Ponder again, dad.

1802
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:13,500
You're a flourishing businessman.
Don't cut a bad deal.

1803
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:17,167
Tell them the truth, dad.
I want no more drama.

1804
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:19,292
What is he saying, Dharampal?

1805
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:21,167
Well...

1806
01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:25,125
Dharampal, look
tell the truth to your uncle.

1807
01:44:26,292 --> 01:44:27,708
Uncle...

1808
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:30,667
-...the thing is...
-Dad!

1809
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:32,292
Don't set yourself ablaze, dad.

1810
01:44:32,375 --> 01:44:33,667
What about mummy?

1811
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:36,542
Don't do such a thing for meat.
Don't do this for meat. Please don't.

1812
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:39,375
-Mummy, why don't you say something to him?
-Yes.

1813
01:44:39,917 --> 01:44:42,875
That's the way of the world, son.

1814
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:47,208
-Whatever will be, will be.
-Exactly.

1815
01:44:47,292 --> 01:44:50,375
-But why is setting himself on fire?
-I'll explain everything, uncle.

1816
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:52,833
My whole family is pure vegetarian.

1817
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:54,583
My parents saw the meat
on the menu and boiled up.

1818
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:56,250
They are saying they will call
off the wedding right away.

1819
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:58,792
That's why my dad got infuriated
and now wants to immolate himself.

1820
01:44:58,917 --> 01:45:01,083
- Uncle, he's lying.
- I'm saying the truth.

1821
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:02,833
I will truly set myself on fire!

1822
01:45:02,917 --> 01:45:04,833
Uncle, they are phony parents.

1823
01:45:04,917 --> 01:45:06,417
Phony are your manners!

1824
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,042
-You're phony.
- Bloody meat-eaters.

1825
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:10,167
-Phony's your father.
-Uncle.

1826
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,125
-Uncle...
- No, dad.

1827
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:14,708
Please Stop!
Good, very good!

1828
01:45:14,792 --> 01:45:17,750
This thing's been blown
out of proportion, uncle...

1829
01:45:18,667 --> 01:45:22,875
Don't let your Aditi's life get ruined.
Don't let it get ruined like this.

1830
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:25,167
- No child.
- Dharampal!

1831
01:45:25,375 --> 01:45:26,875
Is this the truth?

1832
01:45:26,958 --> 01:45:30,375
-Is it true, Mr Dharampal?
-Tell them, dad.

1833
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,542
Tell them.

1834
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:36,417
Uncle...

1835
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:39,625
...this is all Vivek's blunder.

1836
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,292
-Really?
-What?

1837
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:42,875
-I...
-Shut up.

1838
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:44,917
-Uncle...
-Shut up!

1839
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:46,750
The elders are speaking!

1840
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:48,167
Keep quiet!

1841
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,125
Uncle...

1842
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,250
... he got really careless.

1843
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:55,625
He forgot that the groom's family
are pure vegetarians.

1844
01:45:55,792 --> 01:45:57,792
He got angry and upset.

1845
01:45:57,958 --> 01:46:00,500
He says he'll die before
letting the wedding go through.

1846
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:02,833
Bittu give me the matches.

1847
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:03,875
No!

1848
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:05,708
- I'll immolate myself!
- No!

1849
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,250
I will kill myself.

1850
01:46:07,333 --> 01:46:09,667
-They don't understand.
-Dad...

1851
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:12,417
-I want to burn out like a firecracker.
-Uncle.

1852
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,292
Vivek will burn my wedding
house down before it's built.

1853
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:18,375
Don't let your Aditi's life get ruined.

1854
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:19,917
Mom!

1855
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:22,583
Dharampal, this marriage can't,
and won't be compromised.

1856
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:24,500
-But, uncle..
-Keep quiet!

1857
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:26,792
Carelessness is common at your age.
Mistakes happen.

1858
01:46:26,917 --> 01:46:28,750
-Uncle, listen to me.
-Keep quiet!

1859
01:46:28,833 --> 01:46:30,375
Is a leg piece more
important than family peace?

1860
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:32,792
Is a leg piece more
important than family peace?

1861
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:34,375
Speak up.

1862
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,917
Lost your tongue, boy?

1863
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:38,500
No, sir.

1864
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:41,292
Then hurry up and
whisk away the non-veg dishes...

1865
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,042
... and start preparing the rituals.

1866
01:46:43,292 --> 01:46:46,167
Another thing
double the dowry.

1867
01:46:46,375 --> 01:46:48,375
- Papa's fine now.
- We are ready too.

1868
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:49,625
Uncle!

1869
01:46:49,708 --> 01:46:52,458
What would we have done without you?

1870
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:57,042
-Didn't even need the fire brigade.
-Didn't even need the fire brigade.

1871
01:46:57,167 --> 01:46:59,542
Dharampal, do this.

1872
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:01,750
Take Aditi to the ritual stage.

1873
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,667
I don't want to see
tears in her eyes today.

1874
01:47:06,667 --> 01:47:10,542
Vivek for everyone's
sake, don't interfere.

1875
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:13,250
Let the vows commence.
Understand what I'm telling you.

1876
01:47:13,875 --> 01:47:15,333
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

1877
01:47:15,417 --> 01:47:16,417
My blessings.

1878
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,542
My blessings.

1879
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:35,208
Do you become fake
parents professionally...

1880
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:36,875
...or is it just for them?

1881
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:39,625
-Just this once...
-You can make a full career out of it.

1882
01:47:39,833 --> 01:47:42,917
Our country will always
need great artists like you.

1883
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:46,000
Did you ever imagine that you'd be
mingling here with the entire family?

1884
01:47:46,167 --> 01:47:48,167
Never. But you made it possible.

1885
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:50,333
-I did nothing.
-Sanju...

1886
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:52,208
...what about uncle?

1887
01:47:52,292 --> 01:47:55,375
Don't worry.
Now he won't be saying anything.

1888
01:47:55,583 --> 01:47:58,000
How about you honour this?

1889
01:47:59,125 --> 01:48:00,792
Take it.

1890
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:06,042
I am Mrs. Gupta.

1891
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:08,042
I was their maternal aunt
in the first wedding.

1892
01:48:08,125 --> 01:48:10,083
And paternal aunt in the second.

1893
01:48:10,167 --> 01:48:12,625
We work in the same office.
In the HR department.

1894
01:48:12,792 --> 01:48:14,792
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

1895
01:48:14,917 --> 01:48:17,625
And I was the elder brother on
both occasions. Anuj Mathur.

1896
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:20,250
-Namaste.
-I'm the boss in their company.

1897
01:48:21,458 --> 01:48:23,458
But hadn't you died already?

1898
01:48:24,708 --> 01:48:25,792
Tell your master...

1899
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:29,000
... he'd give me a discount
next time I drink at his bar.

1900
01:48:29,542 --> 01:48:33,375
Aren't we relatives now?

1901
01:48:38,667 --> 01:48:40,250
Oh!

1902
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:44,625
The alcoholic!

1903
01:48:55,917 --> 01:49:00,042
"Oh she shines"

1904
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:04,250
"Oh she shines"

1905
01:49:05,375 --> 01:49:07,542
"Sometimes I'm salty"

1906
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,875
"Sometimes like vanilla ice-cream"

1907
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:14,167
"Like a tequila shot that hits you hard"

1908
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:18,792
"Sometimes I'm salty or
like vanilla ice-cream"

1909
01:49:18,875 --> 01:49:23,292
""Like a tequila shot
that hits you hard"

1910
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:25,083
"Hit is our pairing"

1911
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:27,542
"one in a trillion"

1912
01:49:27,958 --> 01:49:30,875
-"It fires everywhere"
-"like bungle in the jungle"

1913
01:49:30,958 --> 01:49:33,500
"Turn off the lights, baby is shining"

1914
