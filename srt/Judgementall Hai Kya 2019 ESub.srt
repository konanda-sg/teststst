1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,560
'This film is solely
for entertainment.'

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,120
'The events and characters
in this film are fictitious.'

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,120
'Through this film,
we do not intend to trouble'

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,880
'any person suffering
from mental illness.'

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,760
'We also do not intend to hurt
the emotions'

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,560
'of the people related to them.'

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,200
'We encourage you'

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,880
'not to be bias towards people
suffering from mental illnesses.'

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,760
'Please be empathetic
and polite to them.'

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,120
'We do not encourage
violence against women.'

11
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,600
Leave me!

12
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
What did I do?

13
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,160
Bobby is watching us.
- She needs to know.

14
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,920
Let me go!

15
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,480
'This Sheersasana...'

16
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,680
'It retains youthfulness.'

17
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,920
'This special yogic position
gives a natural glow on our face.'

18
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,240
'It gives our eyes power
for more than a hundred years.'

19
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,720
'It helps you control hormonal emotions.
Sheersasan is a vital exercise.'

20
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,280
Can we go for a breakfast date?

21
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
I have loose motions.

22
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,320
Yesterday, we cancelled our movie plan
saying you had rashes.

23
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
You have too many complexes, Bobby.

24
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,320
You are not normal.

25
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
I don't talk while doing Yoga.

26
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,320
Why do all our dates end up at the
supermarket or the grocery store,

27
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,320
pickup-drop, buying groceries,

28
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
buying eggs, buying toiler paper
for your uncle.

29
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,600
I also mentioned a kilo of potatoes

30
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,240
I bought two and a half kilos
of potatoes last week for you,

31
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,880
but you didn't
feed me even a single fry.

32
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
You should learn
something from this potato.

33
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,480
It fits everywhere.

34
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,320
Cottage cheese, peas, veggies.
Easy going.

35
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Adjusting.

36
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Be like a potato.

37
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,080
How can I be like a potato?

38
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,800
How much more do I have to adjust?

39
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,520
Don't you want anything from me
except groceries and veggies?

40
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
Bobby.

41
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
Don't you want
to get married and have kids?

42
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,440
Don't you want to settle down?

43
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,160
Did your parents think about
settling down after having sex?

44
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,800
I don't know. Never asked.

45
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
This is what happens eventually

46
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,760
The sex part gets over.

47
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,720
And this is what husbands
and wives spend most times doing.

48
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,160
Buying potatoes and onions
at the supermarket.

49
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,520
And we're already reached there
without having the sex part.

50
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,840
Potatoes and onions.

51
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,120
Bobby.

52
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
I get a strange feeling
that we are brother and sister.

53
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,640
You know Sahil and Kishwar.

54
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,760
They've been going around for
six months and she is already pregnant.

55
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Do I have to get pregnant
to make you happy?

56
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
Should I get pregnant?
Should I?

57
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,560
No one has ever become pregnant by
roaming around in a mall buying potatoes.

58
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
Are you going to get me any work?

59
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,080
What's the point of
having you as my manager?

60
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,960
There is this south Indian film.

61
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,640
Action. Rowdy Rani.

62
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
Please don't burn down the studio.

63
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,800
You dog!

64
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,240
Go and get your mother!

65
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,760
If she had taught you
a lesson when you were young,

66
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,320
my shoe and your
bottom would have never met.

67
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,320
Good job.
- One more.

68
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
Just wrap it up, Bobby.

69
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,480
You're a dubbing artist,
not the heroine.

70
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,960
I've come up with a new tongue twister.

71
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,840
You are a retard, you are a retard,
you are a retard...

72
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,800
"Is she the character or the story?"

73
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,440
"Is she is the fire or is she the rain?"
- 'Go and get your mother!'

74
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,120
'If she had taught you,'

75
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,440
'then I wouldn't have had
to beat you into a pulp.'

76
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,560
"Is she the fire or is she the rain?"
- 'Nice one!'

77
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,040
"Bratty, annoying!"

78
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,960
"Crazy! A free soul!"

79
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,360
"Bratty, annoying!"

80
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,640
"Half empty, half full!"

81
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,240
"Bratty, annoying!"

82
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,040
"Bratty, annoying!"
- 'Do not give up, the victory is yours'

83
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,640
"Bratty, annoying!"

84
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720
'We've discovered water
on the moon...'

85
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,280
'We've discovered water
on the moon'

86
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,440
'but couldn't find
happiness here on earth.'

87
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,640
'Everyone is...'

88
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,400
Are you happy?

89
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,280
Then what are you doing here?

90
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,200
"Once she starts she
doesn't stop walking."

91
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,080
"Always swaying here and there."

92
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
"Carefree and free less attitude."

93
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
"She always makes some noise."

94
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,400
"Expressionless face,
like the devil."

95
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,240
"Always has her way."

96
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,800
"Like a Crossword clue."

97
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,920
'Your life is going to change,
keep journeying'

98
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,400
"She has a notorious mind!"

99
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,840
The pictures are stunning
you should be a movie star.

100
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,080
Thanks.

101
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,680
Hope all the heat inside has gone off.

102
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
This is called cooling agent.

103
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,800
Wonderful, Bobby.
Absolutely wonderful.

104
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
Can you turn up
the heat a little more?

105
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,080
Rascal!

106
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,920
Hope all the heat inside has gone off.

107
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,040
Feeling cool enough?

108
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Bobby Batliwala Garewal.

109
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,160
I had a word with Brijraj's lawyer.

110
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,560
Either you pay 50,000 rupees fine

111
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,440
or have to spend time
at the asylum.

112
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,040
The other one of course.

113
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,680
What?

114
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
The mental asylum.

115
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,240
I am comfortable with that.

116
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,080
Breathe in. Breathe out.

117
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,480
Breathe in. Breathe out.

118
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,280
Breathe in. Breathe out.

119
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,640
Breathe in. Breathe out.

120
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,760
Breathe in.

121
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
Hey! Cockroach!

122
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,960
Kumari Ji.

123
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,600
Why did the fat nurse wear
a helmet every time she ate?

124
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,240
Because she was on a crash diet.

125
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,080
She is here. Run!
- Noodle fry! I'll get you.

126
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
I will take my pills on time.

127
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,800
And finish the full course.

128
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,240
And if?

129
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,800
And if I do something like this again,

130
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
then I'll be thrown back
into the mental asylum again.

131
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,280
What's in this?

132
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,080
A bomb.

133
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,680
Don't act so smart.

134
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,640
You're going
to come back pretty soon.

135
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,280
I'll keep your room ready here!

136
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,720
What's all this junk?

137
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Hey! Careful with that!

138
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,360
Origami.
That's three months of hard work.

139
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,880
Okay, fine.

140
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,080
Let it be, Bobby.

141
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,600
If he pissed you off so muchm

142
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,960
you could have just slapped him.

143
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,680
You had to spend
time in an asylum

144
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,200
Well... I'm back after
three months at the asylum.

145
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
But his nose is never going
to grow back again.

146
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,840
There is a permanent hole
on his face.

147
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,280
Where is Panauti?

148
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
Panauti.
- Bobby.

149
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
Let's go home.

150
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
The new tenants are coming
over today at the bungalow.

151
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,400
I hope you remember that.

152
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,120
Please let them live
with some peace.

153
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,480
She's my friend's daughter.

154
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,560
Well then don't expect me
to pamper her.

155
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,960
Panauti!

156
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,240
All I'm saying is just don't
drive them away like everyone else.

157
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,240
They are building their own house.
And will leave once it's ready.

158
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,360
Let's go home.

159
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,080
Mumtaz.

160
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
Remember to clean
uncle's diaper properly.

161
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
It'll start smelling otherwise.

162
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,960
We've to find a new aunt
for him too.

163
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
You little devil!

164
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
"She feeds grains."

165
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,080
"She sings a song."

166
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,480
"She feeds grains."

167
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,960
"She sings a song."

168
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,040
"People in this world..."

169
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
"Often..."

170
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,200
"Get deceived."

171
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,520
"All it takes..."

172
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,160
"Is a stare..."

173
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,240
"To steal your heart."

174
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,040
Hi. Bobby, right? I am Reema.

175
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,560
This is my husband, Keshav.
It's so nice to finally be here.

176
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,240
That entrance is for you.

177
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,760
This entrance is exclusively for my use.

178
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,640
Me, my guests and my staff.

179
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,520
In case you're staying out late,

180
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,240
then come back in
the morning after partying.

181
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,440
I am an early riser.

182
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,760
There are no other rules.

183
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,560
Enjoy.

184
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,560
You said it's a charming house.

185
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,000
And she's the niece
of some family friend.

186
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
What kind of friends do you have?

187
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,120
Fine. Its only temporary, baby.

188
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,280
We needed a place urgently.
- Yeah.

189
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,000
And come on! Just look at it.

190
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,840
It's so... Charming.

191
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,880
Yeah.
- Oh!

192
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Very charming.

193
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,960
Let's go.
- Let's go.

194
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,640
I've got another regional
south Indian movie for you to dub.

195
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,120
Zara Ki Kahaani!

196
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,560
This one is a horror film.

197
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,960
Do me a favour. Please don't get into
the character while dubbing as usual.

198
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,360
The next thing I know is that
you've turned into a ghost.

199
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,680
You'll wear a white saree,
come out from under the bed.

200
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,920
Every time you do a new story,
you get obsessed with the character

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,040
and we've to suffer.

202
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,400
From now on I'll only get simple
devotional films for you like...

203
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Shut up.

204
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,960
Even the most talentless hacks
get better work.

205
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,920
Good for nothing agent.

206
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,200
All you ever get
is stupid regional movies for me.

207
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,600
My creativity's is dying by the minute.

208
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,440
I am an artist!
- An artist!

209
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,520
Bobby Batliwala Garewal.

210
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,240
If the result of such Parsi-Punjabi
inter-caste marriages are people like you

211
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,920
then such marriages
should be banned.

212
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,720
No one's going to give you work,
understood? Do you get it!

213
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,960
Mental!

214
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Get lost.

215
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,880
Why does everyone
keep calling me a mental?

216
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,120
Is it because my parents
are not there anymore?

217
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,080
Is it my fault that
I caught her fiancé

218
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,600
romancing with
the cook in the toilet?

219
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,120
He is gay!

220
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,560
You should thank me instead, Megha.

221
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,560
Scene no. 1

222
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,040
Taking.

223
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,280
Okay

224
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,440
Who is this stranger
who suddenly waltzed into my life

225
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,760
with the rain, thunder and
in the dark of the night in the rain?

226
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,520
They say...

227
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,280
Meeting a stranger
is a co-incidence.

228
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,720
'There is no harm flying high.
You too can fly'

229
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,840
Thin sticks, thick bricks.
Thin sticks, thick bricks.

230
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,240
Thin sticks, thick bricks.
Thin sticks, thick bricks.

231
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,720
Betty Botter bought some butter.
But she said the butter's bitter.

232
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,720
How much wood would a woodchuck
chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

233
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,080
I thought I thought
of thinking of thanking you....

234
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm not a pheasant plucker,
I'm a pheasant pluckers son.

235
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,680
But I'll be plucking pheasant
when the pheasant plucker is gone.

236
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,560
"Good Lord..."

237
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,200
"What's gonna happen
next will happen."

238
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,560
"Let things run its course."

239
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,080
"People will come."

240
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
"People will go."

241
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,600
"Don't believe me
if you don't want to."

242
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,480
"Who is the one I talk about"

243
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,960
"and keep repeating his name."

244
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,760
"Give me a minute"

245
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,720
"so I can hold my heart
that's skipping a beat."

246
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
"My heart's crazy..."

247
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
"Crazy and high..."

248
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,760
"Let me hold it tight."

249
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
"People will come."

250
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,040
"People will go."

251
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,480
"Don't believe me
if you don't want to."

252
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,200
"Good Lord..."

253
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,920
"What's gonna happen
next will happen."

254
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,600
"Let things run its course."

255
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,840
"People will come."

256
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,760
"People will go."

257
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
"Don't believe me
if you don't want to."

258
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,880
Caught you!

259
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
"What's gonna happen next
will happen."

260
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,160
"Let things run its course."

261
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,400
"People will come."

262
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,640
"People will go."

263
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,640
"Don't believe me
if you don't want to."

264
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,200
I've heard that smoking kills.

265
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,320
I know.

266
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,760
I die every night.

267
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,400
And come back to life every morning.

268
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
Would you like to die?

269
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,560
Keshav.

270
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,560
Wife.

271
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Fantastic.

272
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,040
What a look.

273
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,720
The pictures turned out really nice.

274
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,880
Do you want a scary
background or romantic?

275
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,680
Both?

276
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,320
Combination.

277
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Horror and Romance.

278
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,560
Do a close-up.

279
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,920
Yeah.

280
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,320
That unfortunate night
is still etched on my mind.

281
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,960
Our Master had given the
day off to the entire staff.

282
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,440
That same night his first wife
was found dead, in this mansion.

283
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,960
Some even say...

284
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,840
That the master himself killed her.

285
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,760
'You're killing me!'

286
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,120
Bobby... I am sorry.

287
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,440
I am sorry.

288
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,680
I wanted to invite you over for dinner.

289
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,480
Dinner?

290
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,040
Yes.

291
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,640
Is everything fine between you two?

292
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,600
Yes.

293
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,520
Oh. I had a little accident
with the door.

294
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,960
I can hear loud noises
coming from your room.

295
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,640
All these articles are about rape,
Murder, domestic violence, Bobby.

296
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,360
Is this what you use for your origami?

297
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,240
Coincidence.

298
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,800
Okay. See you tonight.

299
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,440
So basically, I came back after
finishing my baking courses in America.

300
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,560
And never felt like going back.

301
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,480
I mean India just makes
me feel so alive; you know.

302
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,440
The hustle-bustle,
weddings, potholes, weather... Wow!

303
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,520
The smell of garlic.
I just... I love it.

304
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,960
She enjoys India only
through her television set.

305
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,000
She's never fallen in a pothole yet.

306
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,120
She's experienced it only from the comfort
of her living room. Incredible India!

307
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,480
Cockroach.

308
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,840
We have a cockroach problem.

309
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,280
No, I mean.
We've not noticed anything.

310
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,760
And doesn't matter even if we do.

311
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,360
After all,
we manufacture industrial pesticides.

312
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
I can send over
a big can if you want.

313
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,560
No...
It's fine, Keshav, thank you.

314
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,760
Please help yourself, Bobby.

315
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,880
Actually, we don't eat meat.

316
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,520
We're strict vegetarians.
- Yeah.

317
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,600
Only two rules...

318
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,320
No smoking, and no meat.

319
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,880
Of course.

320
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,720
Smoking kills.

321
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,560
Right?

322
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,600
You two have such good habits.

323
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,240
Very nice.

324
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,760
Even my father wouldn't
let my mother smoke.

325
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,040
She would sneak
into the toilet and smoke secretly.

326
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,720
One day my father
caught her red handed

327
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,840
and put out the cigarette
on her arm.

328
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,200
It burned through her skin,
you know.

329
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,560
They were so much in love.

330
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,960
Joking!

331
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,800
Funny.

332
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,400
Which pesticide company
do you work for?

333
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,200
How much more money do you want?

334
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,920
Give me two more months!

335
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,680
I need the money today!

336
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,240
Hey! Don't threaten me! Ever!

337
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,800
I can threaten you too.
Understand!

338
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,520
I...

339
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,760
May I help you?

340
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,560
I am looking to buy some pesticide.

341
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,760
I have a cockroach problem at home.

342
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,000
Sorry, ma'am,
but we sell industrial pesticides.

343
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,360
That's okay.

344
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,600
This is fine.

345
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,040
Can I take?

346
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,360
Wait a minute.
I'll call my boss.

347
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,760
No need.
- One minute.

348
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,320
When did she come here?

349
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
A little while ago.

350
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,600
What was she saying?

351
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,960
She wanted to buy some pesticide
for some cockroach problem.

352
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,320
She is my landlady.

353
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,280
Listen, Sharma. Don't you
have a friend who's in real estate?

354
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,760
Yes.

355
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,880
The Sainath guy...
- Sainath. Yeah.

356
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,640
Ask him to find a decent place for me.

357
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,960
And tell him to hurry up.

358
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,680
'Your life is going to change,
keep journeying'

359
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
Who's there?

360
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,680
Who's there?

361
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,080
Don't you ever sleep?

362
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:06,200
I see you roaming around at
random places in the middle of the night

363
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,640
like a ghost.

364
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,320
You also roam with a torch and a knife
in your hand like a restless spirit.

365
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,520
The fuse is tripping.

366
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,120
But there's electricity in my home.

367
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,400
This other one's tripping.

368
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,400
Because of the air-conditioner load.

369
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,680
I think there's a problem.

370
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,880
We never had a problem with it before.

371
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,240
It's not a problem,
actually, it's pretty common.

372
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,280
Then why did you say
we have a problem.

373
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,920
Sorry.

374
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Why are you checking
the fuse at this hour?

375
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,360
I was practising how to blow a fuse.

376
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,280
In case I had to kill you on a dark,
stormy night, and get away.

377
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
What a loser! Witch.

378
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
She sounds like she has constipation.

379
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,720
She can't scare anyone.

380
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,560
I know another witch...

381
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,520
Varun, come.

382
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,240
What is this Bobby?
Can't you see we're working?

383
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
He's my boyfriend.

384
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,680
I must talk to him right now.
It's urgent. Come.

385
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,400
Coming.
- Varun.

386
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,760
Well, I don't know
our relationship status yet.

387
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,080
But if she says I am her boyfriend,
then I must be.

388
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,400
Let's find out.

389
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Listen.

390
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,480
Crank it up.

391
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,040
I want to have sex.
- Here?

392
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,320
I want it.

393
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Let's book a room in a resort.

394
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,480
Why not at home?

395
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,080
It is much more comfortable.

396
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,320
I only feel like
having sex at resorts.

397
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,440
I don't get into the mood at home.

398
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,360
Bobby I am not that desperate.

399
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,520
To hell with your resort!

400
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,800
I am feeling used.

401
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,960
Cheap.

402
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,640
I am not coming.

403
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,480
Baby, I am all set.

404
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,680
We're not planning to settle down.

405
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,640
We'll be back the next morning.

406
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,440
Anything can happen in a night.

407
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,360
Oh my, God.

408
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,840
See, I told you all the bags are there.

409
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,520
Hello, here come the lovebirds.

410
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,960
You guys are going
to Lonavala as well.

411
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,920
Reema told me.
But it slipped my mind.

412
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,680
Let's go together?

413
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,320
Yeah.

414
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,320
Yeah?
- Yeah?

415
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,640
Sure.

416
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,360
Do you want to go with me or Keshav?

417
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,480
I'm saving precious fuel for you.

418
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,960
You're getting a free ride, free sex.
Still you can't stop complaining.

419
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,600
I haven't got it yet.

420
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,880
There is a strong maybe.

421
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,680
You've been teasing me
for a year now.

422
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,520
I thought it will be
just the two of us.

423
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,800
But now...

424
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,520
The entire neighbourhood's
coming along.

425
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,600
Why don't you bring your
cat and your uncle along too?

426
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,520
Zorabian uncle, do you want to come...

427
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,240
We'll have separate rooms!

428
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,160
People don't hang from
trees when they are in Lonavala.

429
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,720
They stay in hotel rooms.

430
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
I think you're obsessed with Keshav.

431
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
And you're obsessed with sex.

432
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,280
Maybe. But you're obsessed with Keshav.

433
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,840
You're obsessed with him.

434
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
I hope those are not cupcakes.

435
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,480
I am already having so much fun.

436
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,200
It's a good thing we came with you.

437
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
We can celebrate together.

438
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,520
Actually,
we were planning on going alone.

439
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,640
It's okay. We don't mind.

440
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,520
Let's take a selfie.

441
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,000
Woah.

442
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,120
Chocolate?

443
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,520
Let me tell you a story.

444
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,560
Even my family would
go on trips when I was a kid.

445
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,960
One day, papa was on the driver's
seat and mom was sitting next to him.

446
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,360
And they started quarrelling.

447
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,240
Mom lost her temper.

448
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,720
She stabbed dad
in the leg with her filer.

449
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
And dad lost control of the car.

450
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,320
In order to avoid collision
with an oncoming truck,

451
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
he steered the car and...

452
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Bang!

453
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,440
The driver's head was smashed.

454
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,280
His brains fell out.

455
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,800
But mom didn't have a scratch.

456
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,040
Fresh like an apple.

457
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,800
Do you know why?

458
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,280
She had her seatbelt on.

459
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,320
Reema.

460
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,640
Wear your seatbelt.

461
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,560
Joking.

462
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,840
Have this.

463
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,320
Thank you.

464
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,680
No.

465
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,800
These scrambled eggs are delicious.

466
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,840
Believe me, these are delicious.

467
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,640
Best in the world.

468
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,920
Yeah.

469
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,880
Such a lovely couple, isn't it?

470
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,600
God bless them.

471
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,720
Reema!

472
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,920
You were coming on too fast.

473
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,480
But look at this damage.

474
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,000
Drive slowly next time.

475
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,880
The boss will take
it out of my pay.

476
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,840
Do you know what happened?

477
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,080
As in?

478
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,720
Your husband wants to kill you.

479
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,680
He pushed you...
- Will you stop?

480
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,560
You could have died.
He wants to kill you.

481
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,960
I hope we are still going to Lonavala?

482
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,600
Are you happy now?

483
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Keshav and Reema are leaving.

484
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,520
You scared them away too.

485
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,800
How did I scare them away?

486
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,200
What did I do?

487
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,520
Look, Bobby, you should take
your pills on time and regularly.

488
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,520
Or else you'll cause trouble again
and I'll have to suffer.

489
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,120
Where are they going?
Where are they going to stay?

490
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,920
Talk to your friend.

491
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,720
I want their new address.

492
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Uncle. I have a strong feeling
in my stomach that Keshav kill Reema.

493
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,480
If there is a strange
feeling in the stomach

494
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,200
It's usually gas.

495
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,880
Look, Bobby,
are you taking your pills on time?

496
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,440
Are you?

497
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,880
I don't want to take any pills.

498
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,280
They make me sleepy.
I sleep the whole day.

499
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,200
But that's a good thing.
You need all the rest you can get.

500
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,240
Why don't you put me to sleep forever?

501
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,720
Just get me some poison.

502
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,920
Take the bike behind.

503
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,360
Okay. You may go.

504
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,640
Hey! what are you seeing?

505
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,920
Come on. Clear it.

506
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,120
And the pesticide?

507
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,400
There it is.

508
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,680
So, this is where it exploded.
- Yes.

509
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,000
And quickly spread all over.
- Yes.

510
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,480
Dubey, chalk it up
as a gas accident.

511
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,040
And sir, what about the girl
who keeps calling repeatedly...

512
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,800
Claiming that it's a murder
and the husband is the murderer.

513
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,800
I've told you fifty times.

514
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,160
We returned from shopping.

515
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,360
I stayed back in the
car to make an important call.

516
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,520
Reema went upstairs to keep the bags.

517
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,680
We were supposed to go out for dinner.

518
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,560
There was no electricity in the house.

519
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,800
I guess she lit
a matchstick for the candle.

520
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
The air might have
been filled with the fumes...

521
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,800
And there was an explosion.

522
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,840
I ran upstairs immediately.

523
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,880
And yes, a can of pesticide was leaking.

524
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,880
Maybe that acted as an accelerant.

525
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,960
There are always some
cans lying around in the house.

526
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,160
It's all my fault, sir.
I should have been with her.

527
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,480
He is lying.

528
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,800
Why?

529
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,360
He pulled out the fuse.

530
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,440
He made sure the room was dark.

531
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,160
He set Reema on fire.

532
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,840
He killed Reema.

533
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,440
He pulled out the fuse.

534
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,200
He pulled out the fuse.

535
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,720
Why do you think
he pulled out the fuse?

536
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,920
I've often seen him near the fuse box.

537
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,680
Just because I wanted to check the fuse,
it makes me a murderer.

538
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,400
Doesn't that sound silly?

539
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,320
Haven't you...

540
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,800
Haven't you ever fixed
a fuse in your house?

541
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,720
He always lied.

542
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,960
I don't smoke.

543
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,360
Don't eat meat.

544
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,120
He smokes cigarettes like
a chimney in the middle of the night.

545
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,720
He can gobble you up with some ketchup.

546
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,200
That's the kind of vegetarian he is.

547
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
Yes, sir, I lied to
my wife that I didn't smoke.

548
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,960
And about the chicken bit.

549
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,880
That's enough for a murder charge?

550
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,280
Does your wife know you keep
munching all day in the Police Station.

551
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,920
Everyone lies.

552
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,560
Reema was my only family.

553
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Sir.

554
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,640
Keshav did register a complaint
about the power tripping.

555
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
And the complaint's been registered.

556
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,600
Why aren't you arresting him?

557
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,040
Sir... I will kill her.

558
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,440
She is talking nonsense.

559
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,320
He's saying that he will kill me.

560
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,040
When will you arrest him?

561
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,800
He is saying it.

562
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,760
He is saying it!
- Yes.

563
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,520
But he hasn't done it yet.

564
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,000
Bobby, what are you...

565
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,200
She's crazy, sir.

566
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,000
Hello.

567
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,440
Hello, sir. Bobby speaking.

568
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,480
I've evidence against Keshav.
Come over to my house right now.

569
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,840
Hello, sir.. Sir.

570
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,800
Sir, there's a cockroach

571
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,400
that often comes to my house.

572
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,560
And today it came

573
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,760
and sat on Reema and
Keshav's picture.

574
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,800
What does that mean?

575
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,120
She wants justice.

576
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,600
She wants justice.

577
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,960
Bobby is crazy, sir.

578
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,880
She has multiple complexes.

579
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,200
There are at least
a dozen people in her head.

580
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,200
She doubts everyone.

581
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,440
She used to say that
Keshav's going to murder Reema.

582
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,720
She used to wake me up
in the middle of the night,

583
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,000
to tell me that she can hear
sounds coming from their house.

584
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,440
And what did you say?

585
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,960
They must be having sex.

586
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,560
Or making some snacks...

587
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,160
Moving their furniture...

588
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,880
Tell me. How was your
relationship with her?

589
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,160
What relationship, sir?

590
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,160
She treated me like a dog.

591
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,720
Two years ago, I bought a condom
with high hopes sir.

592
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,280
But it expired in my pocket.

593
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,280
Let me show you.

594
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,120
That was our relationship.

595
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,160
No, no, no need.

596
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,360
Still a bachelor.

597
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,680
Throw that away.

598
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,840
I am loving this, sir.

599
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,320
The story on this side
is equally interesting.

600
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,560
Troubling Reema and Keshav
for every small thing.

601
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,560
Secretly spying on them.

602
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,880
The connecting door in the kitchen.

603
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,960
She was a little
inclined towards... Keshav.

604
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,600
Do you make all this, Bobby?
- Yes.

605
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,760
All of it?

606
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,200
Look at this.

607
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,880
These are her pictures.

608
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,640
She liked to dress up like a
movie star and get her pictures clicked.

609
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,080
Did you do this?
- Yes.

610
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,680
Why do you do this?

611
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,760
If I tell you to paste my picture between
Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif,

612
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,600
will you do it?

613
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,640
Of course, I can...
I can do it right now.

614
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,880
Give me your number.

615
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,520
Yes, I photoshopped my pictures.

616
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,880
I like it. Watching my pictures.

617
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,240
Do you have friends?

618
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,280
Friends.

619
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,160
I don't need them.

620
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,720
This case is not your cup of tea.

621
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,920
That Keshav will take you for a ride.

622
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,080
Did you steal this can
from Keshav's factory last week?

623
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,960
It's empty.

624
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,040
What did you do with it?

625
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,800
I told you!

626
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,680
I have a cockroach problem.

627
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,520
The bloody cockroach didn't die.

628
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,640
He makes fake pesticide.

629
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,760
Keshav makes fake pesticides.

630
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,800
You used an entire
can to kill a cockroach.

631
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,120
You want me to kill a lion with it?

632
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,680
The door in your room opens
directly in their kitchen.

633
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,360
And we found this.

634
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,440
You think I killed Reema...

635
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,240
Who made you two detectives?

636
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,600
People like you are a
disgrace to the Police Force?

637
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,440
What was your percentage in high school?

638
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,080
What are we going to charge her with?

639
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,480
That she's strange.

640
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
Has no filters.

641
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,440
Likes to dress up like movie stars.

642
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,320
Photoshop's her pictures.

643
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,240
Have you seen her file?

644
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,880
Clinically ill.

645
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,280
And we won't have any
strong evidence to counter her.

646
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,320
Section 373...

647
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,480
Accidental death due
to a gas cylinder explosion.

648
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,920
Section 373.

649
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,240
You cannot tamper with that.

650
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,200
That's evidence.
- Enough!

651
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,280
Shut up!

652
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,800
This is my wife. Not evidence!

653
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,000
I didn't get time
to moan for her properly thanks to you.

654
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,120
I've had enough.

655
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,760
Stop it, Bobby.

656
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,280
You're going to ruin
your life as well as others.

657
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,440
Please stop it Bobby.

658
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,320
We're closing this case.

659
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,520
It was an accident.

660
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,040
Let's go then, our job here is done.

661
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,000
Take care, Mr. Keshav.

662
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,800
'Do you want to die?'

663
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,520
'I was practising how to blow a fuse.'

664
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,520
'In case I had kill you on a dark,
stormy night, and get away.'

665
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,920
Take care, Bobby.

666
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,560
She wants justice.

667
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,640
Reema wants justice.

668
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,040
Bobby, every guy is not your father.

669
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,440
She wants justice.
- And woman isn't your mother.

670
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,200
Why do you relate
everything with your past?

671
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,680
Bobby, you do know that you're suffering
from acute psychosis.

672
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,320
If you don't take your pills,
you can never manage your normal life.

673
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,600
'What are you doing? Stop.
- That cockroach.

674
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,760
Your hospital's infested
with cockroaches.

675
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,480
If you're seeing cockroaches, that means
your psychosis is getting worse.

676
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,440
And there's nothing you can do.
- Increase the dose.

677
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,880
It's on your face.

678
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,160
It's on your face.
- Somebody help!

679
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,400
It's on your face.
- Somebody help!

680
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,600
If you're seeing cockroaches, that means
your psychosis is getting worse.

681
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,800
Caught it!!!

682
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,240
"Nowhere to go"

683
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,120
"and nowhere to be."

684
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,360
"I wonder where my
destination might be."

685
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,560
'So your presence here is
the consequence of past karma.'

686
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,800
'What you decide to do from here
is your present karma.'

687
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,320
'And your present karma
will decide your future destiny.'

688
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,960
Do you have the address, please?

689
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,200
I really need the post code.

690
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,320
Your first time in London?
- Wait.

691
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,560
Uncle.

692
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,720
Uncle, I accidentally
deleted Megha's message.

693
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,240
Please send me her address.

694
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,120
First time in London?

695
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,800
Why the hell do you care!

696
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,640
Whether it's my first
time or 5th time in London.

697
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,640
"Nowhere to go"

698
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,480
"and nowhere to be."

699
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,880
"I wonder where my
destination might be."

700
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,800
Hi.

701
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,720
Hello.

702
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,960
Here.. A gift for you.

703
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,480
This wasn't necessary...
- Oh.

704
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,720
How did this happen?

705
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,200
I mean when did this happen?

706
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,840
I mean whose is it?

707
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,880
Come in.

708
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,480
Why didn't you speak
to me for all these years?

709
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,040
No calls nor Facebook.

710
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,600
Oh.

711
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,800
So you need a cheap nanny.

712
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,320
Like how people invite their relatives
abroad before the delivery.

713
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
You get better nannies here.

714
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,200
Your uncle was telling me that you've
been sitting at home for quite a while.

715
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,880
So I thought I'll call you here.

716
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,720
My theatre group
is starting a new play.

717
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,280
An adaptation of the Ramayan.

718
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,320
I've suggested your name

719
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,000
as Sita's understudy.

720
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,400
Try not to embarrass me.

721
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,440
I don't want to do an old boring play.

722
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,680
I am sorry.

723
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,160
It's not an old boring play,
it's a modern adaptation of the Ramayan.

724
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,560
From Sita's point of view.

725
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,640
I hope you have ice cream have ice cream

726
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,880
Bobby, let's make this work.

727
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,160
I know you prefer staying alone

728
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,840
so I've arranged for
a place for you as well.

729
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,800
Have some dinner, freshen up,

730
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,880
And then go.

731
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,120
I like your hair.

732
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,280
It's different.

733
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,160
Just one minute. Hold on.

734
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,600
Hi.

735
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,240
Shravan, this is my cousin Bobby.
- Hello.

736
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,280
I'm so sorry,
I need to take this call.

737
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,480
Sorry.

738
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,680
Yeah, just...

739
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,400
Hello.

740
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,840
Unbelievable.

741
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,480
How did you become Shravan from Keshav?

742
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,320
My full name is Keshav Kumar Shravan.

743
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,840
Anything else that you'd like to ask?

744
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,600
Bobby, whatever happened in the past,
I've put all that behind.

745
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,800
The past's not like a piece of candy
which you can just leave behind like that.

746
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,880
Does Megha know about
your previous marriage?

747
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,280
And the incident with Reema.
- Of course.

748
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,080
I tell Megha everything.

749
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,240
I love her.

750
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,800
Would you like to come
and pee with me as well?

751
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,200
Thank you.

752
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,680
Some idiot stole Ravan's
Eighth head and ran off

753
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,000
What kind of a psycho does that?

754
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh. I don't know whether
Bobby told you or not.

755
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,240
But when I was in Mumbai,
with Reema...

756
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,160
Yeah.

757
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,360
Bobby was my landlord.

758
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,640
What? Really?
- Yeah.

759
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,760
Small world.

760
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,080
And you remember, Bobby

761
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,000
how you used to watch me and
Reema from behind the curtains.

762
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,000
So naughty you were.

763
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,840
You didn't tell me your love story.

764
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,160
How did you two meet?

765
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,600
Actually, it was a complete coincidence.

766
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,840
Shravan and Dad's office
were in the same building.

767
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,840
And one day we met in the lift.

768
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,960
Soon we got talking and
since then we've been together.

769
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,360
I love you.
- I love you too.

770
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,960
What a strange coincidence.

771
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,120
Bobby and You.

772
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,280
According to my experience, nothing
is ever a coincidence in Bobby's case.

773
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,480
She makes it happen.

774
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,760
Don't worry, I know her.

775
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,320
That is not very comforting.

776
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,160
When I got engaged to Hiral,
Bobby spread so many rumours

777
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,720
and dad had to call off
the marriage.

778
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,920
Of all the people in India you
had to pick her for the role of Sita?

779
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,600
In fact, she should
play the role of the evil temptress

780
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,200
She will look much better
with her nose cut off.

781
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,840
What rubbish.

782
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,200
It's Bobby, Megha.

783
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,080
The Earth will refuse to swallow her
nor will Raavan want to abduct her.

784
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,360
In fact, he'll take one good
look at her and run back to Sri Lanka.

785
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,760
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

786
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,600
You scared me.

787
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
Bobby, did you reach safely?

788
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,440
I need to talk to you.

789
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,480
Come to the theatre tomorrow.
We'll talk there.

790
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,960
'Modern Ramayan Rehearsals,
happening on stage 2.'

791
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,520
'The triumph of good over evil.'

792
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,400
'The triumph of Ram over Raavan.'

793
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,960
'That's the story of Ramayan.'

794
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,280
'The battle that we all have been
fighting since the beginning of time.'

795
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,280
The Inviolable line,
Sita's abduction and the trial by fire.

796
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,560
These are the things
that makes Sita's story.

797
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,200
The Inviolable line,
Sita's abduction, the trial by fire.

798
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,000
Sita has always...
- Cut. Cut.

799
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,920
Who is that on stage?

800
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,360
Who is she?
- Bobby.

801
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,200
Bobby, what are you doing?

802
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,080
We must talk right now.
- Yeah, sure.

803
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,960
But let's meet the director first.

804
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,000
That's Shridhar,
and he's the director.

805
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,640
Megha.
- Hi.

806
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,680
This is my cousin Bobby.

807
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,320
Remember I told you about her,
for Sita's understudy.

808
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,680
She is also a voice-over artist.

809
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,080
Happy to have you, Bobby.

810
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,240
We're really pleased that you...
- I am not pleased at all.

811
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,400
I came all the way
from India to perform.

812
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,880
Not to be somebody's duplicate

813
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,080
Anyway, you're not going
to be anyone's standby.

814
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,440
But, Gita over there...

815
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,600
What if something happens
to her during the performance.

816
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,840
And that's why you...
- What's going to happen to her?

817
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,040
Nothing is going to happen to her.
She is perfectly fine.

818
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,920
Yes. Yes.

819
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,880
Anyway, you memorise your
dialogues and we'll see.

820
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,040
I don't perform outside India.

821
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,800
Megha, please come outside.

822
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,080
Rehearsals, come on.

823
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,880
'Did she fall
into Ravan's trap by chance'

824
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,440
'or was it her destiny?'

825
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,960
The trial by fire and slaying of Ravan

826
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,600
are integral parts of Sita's story.

827
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,160
If Sita doesn't fall
into Raavan's trap,

828
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,960
then there would be no Ramayan.

829
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,200
If Sita could see
through Ravan's deceit,

830
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,760
then there would be
no Ramayan in the first place.

831
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,320
This one can fit here,
and this one here.

832
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,200
Shridhar.

833
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,520
Megha just get this changes done here.

834
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,280
Yeah. Bobby is here.

835
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,120
I didn't think I'll see you again.

836
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,920
Thought you don't perform
Outside India.

837
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,120
A voice from my gut told me.
- What?

838
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,920
That I should do this role.

839
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,640
Be Sita.

840
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,600
I've heard about
voices from the heart

841
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,240
but from the gut?

842
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,920
When something terrible
is about to happen,

843
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,400
the heart becomes silent.

844
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,240
And the gut starts whispering.

845
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,240
Like right now.

846
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,520
It's telling me that my cousin's
husband will kill her.

847
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,320
Are you happy these days?

848
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,040
No.

849
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,480
I am not happy at all.

850
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,560
All set, sir.
Ready?

851
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,680
Yeah.

852
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,480
In today's world,
Raavan could be any of us.

853
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,960
The question still remains...

854
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,920
Can Sita save herself?

855
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,160
The question still remains...

856
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,680
"Nowhere to go..."
- Can Sita save herself?

857
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,520
"And nowhere to be..."

858
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,320
"I wonder where my destination might be."
- Okay, let go.

859
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,680
Three.

860
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,400
"Nowhere to go..."
- Fall.

861
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,280
"And nowhere to be."

862
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,600
"I wonder where my destination
might be." - What going on?

863
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,320
No.

864
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,040
"Where do I go..."

865
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,840
I'll fall and you catch me. Okay.

866
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,280
Trust.
- No.

867
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,280
"I wonder..."

868
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,520
"I wonder..."

869
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,720
"I wonder where do
I go from here..."

870
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,360
Trust.

871
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:53,920
Let's go.

872
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,800
'It's hard to know behind
which mask lurks the real Ravan.'

873
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,840
'The question still remains...'

874
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,520
'Can Sita save herself?'

875
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,480
"Time stands still for no one..."

876
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:14,160
"I wonder why it's
always ticking away."

877
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,320
"Why the sky never descends..."

878
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,640
"Someone's waiting over the horizon."

879
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,440
"No eagerness to
reach my destination..."

880
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,440
"And always keep journeying on."

881
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:37,320
"I wonder where my
destination might be."

882
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,000
"I wonder..."

883
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,880
"I wonder..."

884
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:48,200
"I wonder where I go from here..."

885
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,240
"I wonder..."

886
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,480
"I wonder..."

887
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,080
"I wonder where I go from here..."
- Line up.

888
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,480
Okay.

889
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,280
Don't.

890
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,800
No.
- And fall.

891
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,040
'The question still remains...'

892
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,600
'Can Sita save herself?'

893
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,560
'The question still remains...'

894
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,680
'Can Sita save herself?'

895
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,360
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

896
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:29,480
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

897
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,480
My fuse short-circuited.

898
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,000
And you just found that out now?

899
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,960
There is no electricity at my place.

900
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,520
So?

901
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,720
Bobby. Come in.

902
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,440
Babies are cute, aren't they?

903
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,280
Yeah.

904
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,000
This one will be cute too, won't he?

905
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,480
I hope so, Bobby.
Especially if it takes after me.

906
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,760
What if it takes after Shravan?

907
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,000
It will still be cute.

908
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,280
Megha.

909
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,640
There were many complications
in Reema's murder case.

910
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,040
No. No.

911
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,800
Please, stop.
- Give me a chance to explain.

912
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,640
No. Please.

913
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,560
I trust him and I...

914
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,120
I love him.

915
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,280
Why can't you just...

916
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,040
If there's no electricity
at her place,

917
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,800
I can't just ask her to leave.

918
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,160
It's just a power cut now...

919
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,640
But mark my words, soon the weather
in London is going to be dark.

920
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,920
It's time we started praying.

921
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,440
She is very unpredictable.

922
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,080
You are such a drama queen.

923
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,600
No, I can't take it.

924
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,640
"Starts chanting the Hanuman Chalisa."

925
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,640
"Starts chanting the Hanuman Chalisa."

926
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,840
"Starts chanting the Hanuman Chalisa."

927
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,280
What on earth are you doing?

928
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:37,920
What are you doing?

929
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,240
Again! You never change.

930
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,680
Bobby, Megha and I are very happy.

931
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,720
Like Reema and you were?

932
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,480
Yes.

933
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,760
Reema and I were happy too.

934
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,640
But then you came in our lives.

935
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,040
I always knew...

936
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,720
That you are going to kill her.

937
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,480
Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

938
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,040
You know, Bobby,
I've been thinking

939
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,400
about Reema's death.

940
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,600
There was another can of pesticide
your house.

941
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,360
The thought always bothered me.

942
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,760
You don't realise it, Bobby...

943
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,640
But there are voices in your head.

944
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,240
Even people.

945
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,640
In my head...

946
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,840
Which is why you're on meds.

947
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,880
Your battle isn't against me, Bobby.

948
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,200
Its with your own self.

949
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,080
You need to save yourself.

950
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,040
Bobby.

951
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,320
Megha is your sister.

952
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,800
Let her be.

953
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,480
Please go away and treat yourself.
- I am not going anywhere!

954
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,600
I am not going anywhere!

955
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,880
I am Sita!

956
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,840
Sita.

957
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,920
Now, Ravan isn't looking for Sita.

958
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,840
Sita is looking for Ravan.

959
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,760
I will expose you.

960
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,880
I will expose you!

961
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,680
You know what, Bobby...

962
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,760
I was helpless in Reema's case.

963
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,480
But this time I won't let anything
happen to Megha.

964
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,200
I won't let anything happen to my child.

965
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,360
If you're crazy...

966
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,560
Then I'm going
to be crazier than you.

967
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,400
And when a sane man loses it...

968
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,200
He can be a lot worse
than the craziest of the lot!

969
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,160
And don't forget that.

970
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,760
This is my family.

971
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,480
My family.

972
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,840
I will expose you!

973
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,320
Out.

974
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,480
I will expose you!
- Yeah, go expose me.

975
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,040
I will expose you!

976
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,080
Go. Expose.

977
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,120
There was another can of pesticide
in that house that belonged to you.

978
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,200
'And that thought always bothered me.'

979
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,680
What do you keep listening all the time?

980
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,080
The same old boring classical concerts.

981
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,560
Don't be upset.

982
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,080
I already told you that
I didn't know anything.

983
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,320
Uncle said that she
wasn't keeping well, so...

984
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,480
She is mad, Megha.

985
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,600
And dangerous.

986
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,360
Wherever she goes,
she destroys things.

987
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,880
Wait a minute.

988
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,560
You married Bobby's sister?

989
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,440
First, she was your neighbour
and now she's family.

990
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,160
You've been swarmed by bad luck.
Check your horoscope.

991
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,760
You should try voodoo,
go to a witch-doctor, or a shaman.

992
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,720
God is playing games with you.

993
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,800
I don't know whether Reema's death
was an accident or something else.

994
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:37,920
It could have also been Bobby.

995
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,960
She is bit crazy but
she cant be a murderer, no.

996
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,320
I have to convince Megha
that her condition is dangerous.

997
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,680
Megha and you
should run away and hide.

998
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,040
She'll go looking
for you guys for some time.

999
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,840
She'll get bored
and come back to India.

1000
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,200
That's the only way

1001
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,200
because nothing else will work.

1002
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,720
Please, Varun. I have to
send her back somehow

1003
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,480
and I need your help.
- Not today. There is a girl...

1004
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,720
I've known her for four months.

1005
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,600
Her name is Shanaya. She is quite hot.

1006
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,280
I shouldn't be saying this, but...
I think I am going to get lucky today.

1007
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,160
Quickly tell me what you want.

1008
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,440
Anything you can dig up
related to Reema, me, or Megha.

1009
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,880
Maybe her old diaries,
photos...

1010
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,600
Medical reports.

1011
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,320
Anything that you can find.
Anything...

1012
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,280
I didn't know she was this crazy.

1013
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,320
She photoshopped herself
in all of Reema's pictures.

1014
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,400
And now she will go after Megha.
I am worried about her now.

1015
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,040
Hi.

1016
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,440
I was passing and thought
I should check the fuse.

1017
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,080
"Good Lord..."

1018
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:03,560
"What's gonna happen next
will happen."

1019
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,800
"Let things run its course."

1020
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,920
Fusebox?

1021
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,320
"People will come."

1022
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,600
"People will go."

1023
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,880
"Don't believe me
if you don't want to."

1024
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,840
I think someone cut the wire.

1025
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,800
What happened, Bobby?

1026
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,600
What happened, Bobby?
Tell me.

1027
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,360
Keshav.
- Yes.

1028
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,120
He came over to my place.

1029
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,240
Yes, he did tell me.

1030
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,080
That he went to your place
to check the fusebox.

1031
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,200
What happened?

1032
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,680
He tried to...

1033
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,080
What?

1034
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,560
Hi, baby.

1035
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,920
Hi.

1036
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,680
Hey, Bobby, are you all right?

1037
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,000
What happened?
- I don't know.

1038
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,400
What happened?
- It's okay.

1039
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,240
Bobby, where are you going?

1040
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,880
Bobby.
- Hold on.

1041
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,080
Megha, last night
I was at Bobby's place.

1042
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,960
To fix the fuse.

1043
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,320
I think someone cut the wire.

1044
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,440
"Good Lord..."

1045
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,440
"What's gonna happen next
will happen."

1046
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,000
"Let things run its course."

1047
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,640
What the hell!
No, Bobby.

1048
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,000
"People..."

1049
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,160
Of course, I ran from there.

1050
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,400
She's so obsessed with me, Megha.

1051
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,280
S***.

1052
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,120
I think someone cut the wire.

1053
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,360
Who?

1054
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,120
This is what you
always wanted, right?

1055
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,120
Yes, uncle.

1056
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,560
Shravan was married to Reema first.

1057
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,280
Yes, he's the same Keshav.

1058
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,680
Just give me the inspector's
number who was handling the case...

1059
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,120
I'll give you his number.

1060
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,200
Why are you troubling your uncle?

1061
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,080
But before that
I want you to see something

1062
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,240
This.

1063
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,080
This. This. This. And this...

1064
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:39,160
She gets her picture clicked dressed
as the characters she dubs for.

1065
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:40,960
And this...

1066
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
Reema and me.

1067
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,840
Bobby and me.

1068
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,280
Reema and me.

1069
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,200
Bobby and me,
neatly photoshopped.

1070
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,360
And this. Reema and me in Bangkok.

1071
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,000
And that's Bobby.

1072
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,560
She removed Reema from the pictures,
and maybe...

1073
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,880
And look at this.

1074
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,320
This one's the best.

1075
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,600
Our wedding picture.

1076
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,800
Bobby had it.
- What?

1077
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,280
She knew about our marriage.

1078
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,480
She didn't come to London
because you invited her.

1079
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,360
She followed me here.

1080
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,160
This was planned. All of this.

1081
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,240
But...

1082
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,880
But if she's obsessed with you,

1083
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,680
then why was she
framing you for murder?

1084
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,200
Because she is crazy.

1085
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,360
She doesn't follow logic.

1086
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,240
Listen, Shravan, this...
- You still don't believe me, do you?

1087
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,480
Wait and watch.

1088
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,520
See where her madness takes her!

1089
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,600
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1090
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,920
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1091
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,040
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1092
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:01,080
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1093
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,720
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1094
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,400
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1095
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:44,080
"Never cross this inviolable line."

1096
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:49,240
"Or you'll be torn to shreds."

1097
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,440
"Never cross this line..."

1098
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:59,680
"Never cross this inviolable line."

1099
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,600
"Or you'll be torn to shreds."

1100
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,080
Oh my God! Is she okay?

1101
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,120
Bobby.

1102
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,160
Are you mad?

1103
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,840
She hasn't call uncle either.

1104
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,320
God knows where she is.

1105
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,520
Wherever she goes, something always
happens. Accidents happen around her.

1106
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,400
She'll be roaming
around the streets alone.

1107
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,120
That's it.
I am going to call the cops.

1108
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,640
I need restraining orders against her.
- No.

1109
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,080
No, I'll have to call the cops.
- No, Shravan, she is not a criminal,

1110
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,240
she's my sister.

1111
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,960
Is that girl alright?

1112
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,480
Bobby, where are you?

1113
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,040
Everyone's looking for.

1114
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,320
Is she fine?

1115
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,160
Tell me where you are.

1116
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,280
I want to know if she's fine.

1117
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,280
Yes, she is fine, Bobby.

1118
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,840
Where are you?

1119
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,560
Do you know who is behind all this?

1120
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,520
Keshav.

1121
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,800
He wants to kill me.

1122
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,840
Tell me where you are, I'll come.

1123
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,200
Why?

1124
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,400
You want to throw
me in an asylum?

1125
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,320
Bobby.

1126
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,760
'A message from Ram-ji'

1127
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:42,960
You were at the asylum.

1128
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,360
Look. A close friend
of yours is here too.

1129
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,480
Raw crisps, fried crisps. Raw crisps,
fried crisps. Raw crisps, fried crisps.

1130
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,320
Varun.

1131
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,360
I've come to give you free advice,
but you just won't stop complaining.

1132
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,680
Face your fears,
don't run.

1133
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,480
'Face your fears,
don't run'

1134
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,880
'Do not give up.
The victory is yours'

1135
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,960
'Face your fears, don't run'
'You are Sita'

1136
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,520
Excuse me

1137
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,480
Why are you running away from us, silly?

1138
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,840
Don't be a stranger.
We are together in this.

1139
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,400
We are here to help you,
else they will throw you in an asylum.

1140
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,360
Quiet. Quiet.

1141
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,000
Poor thing got scared.

1142
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,400
You are Ram.

1143
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,480
You are Sita.

1144
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,960
You are Ram.
You are Sita.

1145
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,120
Sweetheart.
- Sir.

1146
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,640
These people are stalking me.

1147
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:40,720
Who?

1148
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,920
These people.

1149
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,760
There.

1150
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,000
There's no one there.

1151
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,520
They are there.

1152
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,040
There's a wingman, there's a tail man.
- Are you crazy?

1153
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,480
And there's Ram-ji.

1154
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,560
Look.
- There's no one.

1155
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,000
They are there.
- No.

1156
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:03,880
They are there.

1157
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,440
"Trying to see what they see."

1158
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,440
"But you can't see what they see."

1159
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,360
"Illusions and mirages."

1160
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,280
"Silence that actually speak."

1161
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,200
"Poison and medication
is the same thing."

1162
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,120
"Running out of breath
when you wish to live."

1163
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,040
"Life and death
is just an illusion."

1164
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,400
"Actually nothing is real."

1165
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,520
"Are you a little temperamental?"

1166
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,120
"Are you judgemental?"

1167
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,360
"Are you judgemental?"

1168
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,840
"Are you judgemental?"

1169
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,640
Listen to the voice
from your gut. He lies.

1170
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,240
"Are you judgemental?"

1171
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,080
Why use a sword when
you can use a needle?

1172
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,440
Why use a sword when
you can use a needle?

1173
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,720
Very deep.

1174
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,720
Deep.

1175
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,680
Why don't you go drown
yourself in that deep?

1176
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:13,160
Do you want us to go looking for
a needles, thread and tailors in London?

1177
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:18,080
How it all began shall
reveal how it will unfold.

1178
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,200
Meaning.

1179
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,240
Meaning the Lord is trying to say...
Start from his childhood.

1180
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,720
The photo you risked your life
to find in Keshav's study.

1181
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,040
Look there.

1182
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,120
"Truth has many names."

1183
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,000
"Truth comes at many price."

1184
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,800
"It maybe the beginning for you"

1185
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,800
"but it's not the end for me."

1186
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,720
"I am different, and so are you."

1187
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,680
"Why is it wrong to be different."

1188
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,520
"The road to your
dreams isn't difficult."

1189
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,280
"So why is it so tough."

1190
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,760
How sad, all the children
died in the fire.

1191
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,240
Yusuf Sheikh.

1192
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,640
Aakash Khurana.

1193
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,040
Adheer Bhatt.

1194
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,240
Priyanshu.

1195
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,040
John Thomas.

1196
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,120
Keshav?

1197
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,640
Then how can it be Keshav?

1198
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:55,880
There's something not right
about this, Bobby.

1199
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,400
Let's check the other names.

1200
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,480
"Are you judgemental?"

1201
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,240
"Are you judgemental?"

1202
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,520
So that's his real game.

1203
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,680
All the children died
in the fire at the orphanage.

1204
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,640
And yet the criminal
records against their name.

1205
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:12,760
Wait a minute.

1206
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,080
You mean Keshav took on their identities
after they died and left a trail of crimes.

1207
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,920
Look at this picture.
Doesn't he look like Keshav?

1208
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,240
How does that look like Keshav to you?
He looks timid.

1209
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,200
How can he be Keshav?

1210
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,320
You have buttons for eyes.
Take a closer look.

1211
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,680
Lord.

1212
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,440
How it all began shall
reveal how it will unfold.

1213
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,520
The Lord is actually stuck
in repeat mode.

1214
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,480
Cute.

1215
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,240
"Are you judgemental?"

1216
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,640
"Are you judgemental?"

1217
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,360
"Are you judgemental?"

1218
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:03,320
The fire that broke out in Yusuf
Sheikh's butcher shop in Murshidabad

1219
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,360
has sparked communal riots.

1220
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:09,440
Yusuf Sheikh's wife Tasnima Sheikh
became the first victim of these riots.

1221
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,200
And Yusuf himself has been missing
since the riots started...

1222
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,040
How did we end up in this mess?

1223
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,360
He's coming.
Let's get out of here.

1224
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,120
John is Yusuf. Yusuf is Shravan.

1225
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,880
Shravan is Keshav, Keshav is John.

1226
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,760
But who will believe me?

1227
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,240
Bobby suffers from Dissociative
identity disorder.

1228
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,040
The condition of her
mind is such that

1229
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,760
she can draw any
conclusion out of anything.

1230
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,320
And that will be the reality for her.

1231
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:57,360
The voices in her head,
the characters, are all real for her.

1232
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,760
She believes in them.
They can make her do anything.

1233
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:06,960
Megha.

1234
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,280
She is a ticking time bomb.

1235
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,480
And we should get out
of here before she explodes.

1236
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,520
Please. Pack your bags.

1237
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,400
Varun was right.

1238
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,080
We'll just have to hide from her.

1239
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,160
Who is Varun?

1240
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,880
"Wherever you set foot..."

1241
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,680
"My heart follows."

1242
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:29,760
"O my heart stealer..."

1243
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,560
You always catch me
at the wrong moment.

1244
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,560
I was finally going to
get lucky and you ruined it.

1245
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,960
Varun. Megha, my wife.

1246
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,000
Hi.
- Hello, ma'am.

1247
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,080
How are you today?

1248
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,000
Varun, did Bobby get
in touch with you by any chance?

1249
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,480
We can't find her anywhere.

1250
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,560
Why would she call me?
Its you she is obsessed with.

1251
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,240
Remember you told
me how she used to drive you mad

1252
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,720
Can you please tell Megha?

1253
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:57,640
She is a little bit crazy.

1254
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,800
A friend of mine told her that
Varun was arrested and went to jail.

1255
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,720
He told her that I got
arrested at some youngster's party.

1256
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,040
Since then she made
a big fuss about everything.

1257
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,440
If any Varun in the world committed
a crime, she would think that it was me.

1258
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,360
Some Varun made an MMS clip,
she thought that was me.

1259
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,520
All the thieves and criminals
whose names were Varun were me.

1260
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,400
She turned me into
a serial sex offender.

1261
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,160
But never that matinee idol
Varun Dhawan.

1262
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,320
Idiot! Rascal!

1263
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,080
I am not like that,
but Bobby thought I was.

1264
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,200
Bobby is crazy.
She is mad.

1265
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,200
Quiet.

1266
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,520
Bastard.

1267
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,960
How dare you lie to me?
- No.

1268
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,160
Get lost. pervert.
- I am not like that...

1269
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:29,120
Don't ever call me again. Rascal.

1270
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,600
You trust this idiot.

1271
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,920
And you trust Bobby.

1272
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,920
John is Yusuf. Yusuf is Shravan.
Shravan is Keshav. Keshav is John.

1273
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,520
Being an amateur detective won't help.

1274
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,200
The Police has already
checked his background.

1275
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,480
And they found nothing.

1276
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,560
He's a smooth criminal.

1277
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,480
And people think we are crazy.

1278
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:58,000
The silly evidence we found on Google
is not going to convince anyone.

1279
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,960
No one will believe us.

1280
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:01,680
No one will believe us.

1281
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,040
No one will believe us.

1282
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,480
I'm not a pheasant plucker,
I'm a pheasant pluckers son.

1283
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,960
But I'll be plucking pheasant
when the pheasant plucker

1284
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,040
is gone.

1285
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,720
Keep her sedated.

1286
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,200
And then tomorrow we'll
transport her back to India.

1287
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,440
How are you feeling?

1288
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,680
I told the doctor how I found
you at the club, all covered in blood.

1289
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,600
You know, the doctor was saying

1290
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:20,360
that judging by your mental
condition, you did all this to yourself

1291
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,920
They are sending you
back to India tomorrow.

1292
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,160
Sadly, you won't be around
for Megha's delivery.

1293
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,680
But don't worry we I'll send
you pictures of her and the baby.

1294
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,120
And you can always photoshop
yourself in those pictures.

1295
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,000
Have a nice life.

1296
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,920
"Get up and face your fears."

1297
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:02,200
"There's no turning back now.
Don't run away."

1298
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,840
"He's evil."

1299
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:16,080
"And you must face him."

1300
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:27,320
"Burn everything down."

1301
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:33,160
"This is your moment of trial by fire."

1302
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,800
Bobby!

1303
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,600
You're still sleeping.

1304
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,720
Wake up or else they will send you
to an asylum tomorrow.

1305
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,640
He managed to fool
the world again, Bobby.

1306
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,240
Only we can fight him.

1307
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,960
Why? Are we the Queen of Jhansi who's
going to ride out wielding a sword.

1308
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,680
Let there be a trail by fire.

1309
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,560
No evidence. No witnesses.

1310
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,760
It's a do or die.

1311
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,880
Only fire will reveal the truth.

1312
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,800
Don't mind but do you think
we are all going crazy?

1313
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,040
Jump into the fire.
Jump into the fire.

1314
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,760
Jump into the fire.
Jump into the fire.

1315
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,600
What do you mean she escaped?

1316
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,560
How can anyone escape
from the hospital?

1317
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:13,600
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1318
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,680
"Holy Sanskrit Verses"

1319
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,640
How is it possible, Shravan?

1321
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,400

1324
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,960
Sir, Bobby sent this for you.

1325
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,720
Bobby.

1326
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,120
Where is Megha?

1327
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,960
Megha!

1328
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,480
Megha!

1329
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:32,520
Megha!

1330
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:40,320
Bobby!

1331
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,400
In every Age,
Sita's been questioned.

1332
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,160
Her honesty,

1333
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,560
or her ideology.

1334
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,520
Bobby.

1335
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:03,440
I am prepared for
the trial by fire again.

1336
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,400
You are Sita.
The fire will not harm you.

1337
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:08,640
Jump in the fire. Jump in the fire.
Jump. Jump.

1338
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,720
I told you she's crazy, Megha.

1339
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,680
She killed Reema! She is...

1340
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,880
She is crazy, Megha!
- Yes, I am crazy.

1341
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,840
And you?

1342
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:23,880
John Thomas.

1343
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,800
Yusuf Sheikh.

1344
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,920
Shravan Kumar.
Keshav... Who are you?

1345
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,800
Today the truth shall be revealed.

1346
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,200
I am prepared for the trial.

1347
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,320
If I'm lying,

1348
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,000
then I shall perish with my lies.

1349
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:48,760
Or else you shall burn in yours.

1350
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,760
This is the trial.

1351
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,600
It's given in every age.

1352
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,600
Light up.

1353
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Light up everything.

1354
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,320
Burn everything.

1355
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,640
Fire.

1356
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,120
Let's end this once and for all.

1357
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,680
You know what
the saddest part will be?

1358
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,120
Poor Megha will also die burning
because of your madness.

1359
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,160
You are going to kill her.

1360
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:38,640
That's nonsense.

1361
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,520
We just wanted Megha
to know the truth.

1362
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,840
No.
- Megha will die.

1363
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,800
He will kill eveyone.
- No.

1364
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,080
Bobby.

01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,440
Yusuf Sheikh.

1370
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:16,200
Surya Rao.

1371
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,520
Keshav Mishra.

1372
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,560
Shravan Kumar.

1373
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,960
They are all me.

01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:43,680
I am the infinite!

1377
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,280
You did so much research on me.

1378
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,560
Help us!

1379
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:40,520
Help us!
- 'Yes, I killed everyone.'

1380
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,640
'John. Yusuf. Keshav.'

1381
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,920
And when I heard people
screaming and wailing...

1382
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:54,000
It was like... Magic.

1383
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,240
It struck a chord inside me.

1384
01:44:58,720 --> 01:44:59,960
You always asked me...

1385
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,840
Wait a minute, Megha.

1386
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:11,240
You always asked me
what I keep listening to?

1387
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,400
The Indian classical music.

1388
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,920
Tasneem Sheikh.

1389
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:22,920
Blah blah blah blah...

1390
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,680
And my favourite... Reema.

1391
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,400
Thanks to you, Bobby.

1392
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:42,880
'I saw you barge into our place'

1393
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,640
'and pour pesticide on Reema.'

1394
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:48,760
'How did you know that
it was time for her to go?'

1395
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,800
Oh, love.

1396
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,440
Why did you call up
Mercy Home orphanage, darling?

1397
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:08,160
What do you want to know?

1398
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,600
You know, Megha'

1399
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,400
I always thought
Reema would be my favourite.

1400
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,080
But I think you will be better.

1401
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,680
Since there's another
life breathing inside you.

1402
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,480
You're going to be my masterpiece.

1403
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,400
Bobby, when will you give up?

1404
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,080
You only have people in your head.

1405
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,680
But I actually live those lives.

1406
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:17,280
Pause. Play. Repeat.
Pause. Play. Repeat.

1407
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:23,120
Tell me.

1408
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,240
Tell me.
Who is the bigger psycho now?

1409
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,440
You or me?

1413
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,880

We have only found

a female injured.
And we found a male who is...

1422
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,840
Bobby, thank you.

1423
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,840
Put that in your report.

1424
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,800
Are you okay?

1425
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,080
No.

1426
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,360
I'm mad.

1427
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,720
The world calls me mental.

1428
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,200
Maybe they just don't understand me.

1429
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,560
Maybe people we don't understand

1430
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,720
are mad.

1431
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,960
I know my world
is different than yours.

1432
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:10,000
I know how different.

1433
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:12,160
But whatever it is...

1434
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,880
I love the way it is.

1435
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,920
I just want to live on my terms.

1436
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,160
"Are you judgmental?"

1437
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:45,240
"You have wasted your
youth chasing Gucci, Armaani,"

1438
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:48,200
"checking the brand tags."

1439
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,080
"Come, let me tell you what fashion is"

1440
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:53,760
"as your friend has a unique swag."

1441
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:59,080
"You've wasted your youth
chasing Gucci, Armaani,"

1442
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:04,160
"checking the brand tags."

1443
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,760
"Come, let me tell you what fashion is"

1444
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:09,320
"as your friend has a unique swag."

1445
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,920
"My patiala suit is a killer one."

1446
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,360
"And Im a punjabi girl, sardaarni,"

1447
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:17,000
"All with all your bling and moves,"

1448
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,920
"I've still got more swag than you."

1449
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,800
"Unique Swag."

1450
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:22,920
"Drop it."

1451
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,680
"Get lost."

1452
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:33,880
"Always talking money,"

1453
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,160
"always here to sting"

1454
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,520
"Show me how you love me."

1455
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,560
"I dont want your bling"

1456
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:40,360
"Dont talk too much babe."

1457
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,720
"I dont want your Gucci Armani tag."

1458
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,440
"People know that I am a true friend"

1459
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,680
"to anyone who I have called a friend."

1460
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,080
"I don't tend to speak my mind"

1461
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,200
"that is why I try to stay away"

1462
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,920
"from these beautiful faces."

1463
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:55,320
"You are a hunter
and are always ready."

1464
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:57,960
"To hang out with the single ladies."

1465
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,720
"And despite your sweet
words and ferraris,"

1466
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,480
"you never keep your promises."

1467
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,320
"Unique Swag."

1468
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,400
"Drop it."

1469
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,720
"Seeing you trying to holler,
Dripping Fendi Prada."

1470
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,040
"Thinking you're a Raja"

1471
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:22,360
"Baby, you better come hot.
I'm the queen of swag."

1472
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:23,800
"Click my photos."

1473
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,400
"With my beamer and benz,
I'm surely gonna leave."

1474
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,680
"You've wasted your
youth chasing Gucci, Armaani,"

1475
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:31,200
"checking the brand tags."

1476
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:33,640
"Come, let me tell you what fashion is"

1477

"as your friend (lover) has a unique swag."

1478

"Unique Swag."
