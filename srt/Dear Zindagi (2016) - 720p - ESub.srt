1
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,451
Priya, listen to me

2
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,652
Let go of me

3
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,562
You always do this,
it's always other women

4
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,120
I didn't mean to hurt you

5
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,722
Every time you say the same thing

6
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,126
You know how much I love you

7
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,668
Please, listen to me

8
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,232
I love you so much

9
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:12,666
Cut!

10
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,705
Kaira, good for you?

11
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,668
Guys we'll do one more

12
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,433
We got this shot right?

13
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,704
We are running out of time, we don't
have permission for the whole day...

14
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,110
Kaira has a nice idea,
we'll do one more

15
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,608
What's the point of finishing
on time if we don't get a good shot?

16
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,482
Look, no respect for producers

17
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,054
Especially these new
cameramen... sorry... women

18
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,351
Come on, hurry up, let's do this!

19
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,394
Fatima, we are going to change the guy

20
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,293
You want the other guy?

21
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,395
He's got to look a little sexy

22
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,596
Get the camera

23
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,449
Cut!

24
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,318
Got that?

25
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,621
Fantastic!

26
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,625
Superb execution!

27
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,356
Good shot

28
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,025
I shot it at 48 frames,
speed up the end if you like

29
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,795
I'm going to take a
plate of the building now

30
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,594
Saw the shot Raghuvendra?

31
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,802
That one expression of the girl
checking out the passing guy says so much

32
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,408
I wish I had met Kaira earlier, I
would have shot the whole film with her

33
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,583
I got that

34
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,249
It's a wrap guys! Thank you!

35
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,049
Told you, don't have to carry my bag

36
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,058
I'm so sorry

37
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,430
Your mom called on
my cellphone earlier...

38
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,263
you never pick up yours...

39
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,004
please call her back,
before you take off

40
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,530
I will, you enjoy your mini holiday

41
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,011
You could have enjoyed
Singapore with us...

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,537
but you wanted to
fly with someone else

43
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,512
Shut up

44
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,049
Go go

45
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,055
I tried to upgrade you, couldn't do it

46
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,216
Please

47
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,719
Hi guys what can I get for you?

48
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,192
Beer
- Coke

49
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,751
Just Coke?

50
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,422
I drink only on two occasions,
when I am in love and when I am not

51
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,724
<i>Okay...</i>

52
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,633
Cheers!

53
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,568
Kaira, everything okay?

54
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,510
As in we're good right?

55
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,550
What are you talking about,
what happened to us?

56
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,714
Cheers!

57
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,997
Raghuvendra, I want to
shoot an entire feature film...

58
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,595
enough of this patchwork

59
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,659
I mean I can't keep waiting
for other cameramen to fall ill...

60
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,170
no one will even know
that I've shot this scene

61
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,730
I want to shoot my own film

62
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,008
You will

63
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,740
Who wouldn't want to work
with a hot DOP like you?

64
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,673
Hot!

65
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,079
Is that my only talent, seriously?

66
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,276
Seriously

67
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,711
Don't talk to me

68
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,413
Of course you're talented...

69
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,219
You are shooting so many
ads...earning good money

70
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,782
Ads and all are fine

71
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,755
I want to shoot a film

72
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,160
You will, you will, soon

73
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,132
And you're so young, I mean...

74
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,759
you wear zero number
glasses to look older

75
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,159
Excuse me?

76
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:03,230
If actresses can be at their peak at
a young age then why not technicians?

77
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,640
Have you heard of the word 'Patience'?

78
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,972
No I haven't, tell me about 'Patience'

79
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,278
Pick up...

80
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,251
pick up the cook's call...

81
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,718
if you want I can
just go and come back

82
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,687
He is not a cook,
he is the owner of a restaurant

83
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,695
Not even a cook?

84
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,363
That shot was your idea right?

85
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,699
Girl with guy, checking out other guy?

86
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,768
Inspired from life?

87
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,501
Listen Kaira...

88
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,374
you take my seat, I'll take yours...

89
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,675
I can sit in Economy class,
no need to sacrifice

90
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,583
Your long legs won't
fit in there anyway

91
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:50,577
That is true

92
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,644
It is very true

93
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,758
Yes Mom, it was good

94
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,330
Can't talk now,
the plane is going to take off

95
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,420
Bye!

96
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,505
So...

97
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,702
can I come up?

98
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,541
I'm really tired

99
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,579
Dinner?

100
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,548
I'm busy, but I'll see you

101
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,387
Alka!

102
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,517
<i>Didi! (Sister)</i>

103
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,952
You've become so fat!

104
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,592
L-low was your flight'?

105
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,276
Your mother called 3 times

106
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,717
You are so sweet Alka

107
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,324
Thank you!

108
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,359
Do you want coffee
or shall I serve breakfast?

109
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,165
Later

110
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,201
Didi...

111
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,272
this guy is so cute

112
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,270
Was cute!

113
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,105
Was!

114
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,580
I don't find him cute anymore...

115
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,175
just take down his photo

116
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,560
I just put it all in perfect order

117
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,027
Now it's perfect

118
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,253
So then, how was your trip'?

119
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,621
It was good

120
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,656
Just good?

121
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,498
Okay, great

122
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,504
You look beautiful sweetheart

123
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,283
Sorry, I'll just...

124
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:17,090
No it's okay, go ahead
meet them I have to go pee anyway

125
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,527
Table for 4 please?

126
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,122
I'm sorry guys,
we have a strict dress code

127
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,394
No shorts and slippers please

128
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,231
Come on, it's his birthday

129
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,429
I'm sorry, wish I could

130
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,366
But she's wearing shorts!

131
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,567
It's okay for girls, I'm sorry guys

132
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,221
Just this once, only for you

133
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,461
Next time I'll come along
on shoot with you, as your caterer

134
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,462
What do you say?

135
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,004
I slept with Raghuvendra

136
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,160
I should go...

137
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,576
Sid...

138
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,086
I'm sorry

139
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,121
What are you doing!

140
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,238
It's all good!

141
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,510
It's okay, it's all good...

142
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,714
Hey look, Sid!

143
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,321
Shit! Where?

144
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,455
That's not Sid, Jackie

145
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,690
He looked so much like him...cute

146
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,660
Poor thing, nice guy he was

147
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,328
Really nice

148
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,737
Little too nice for you right?

149
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,615
Oh my God! This jacket!

150
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,019
It reminds me of school,
our 'Famous Five' gang

151
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,619
Was that the 8th or 9th grade?

152
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,986
10th grade, same one

153
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,526
See, I can have a long
term relationship too

154
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,255
Yes, with things

155
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,196
So are we things too?

156
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,289
Yes, you are a thing

157
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:17,658
Sorry

158
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,499
Have you gone blind in love?
Am I invisible?

159
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,731
We said sorry

160
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,701
Staring into her eyes!

161
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,708
They are a couple

162
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,644
'Oh my coochie coo'
'So sweet I love you'...

163
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,182
The same rubbish crap it's irritating

164
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,649
What are you doing?

165
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,714
Go to hell!

166
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,054
Stupid! Hate couples!

167
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,132
Are you guys here to help
me or to do a comedy show?

168
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,099
Both

169
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,262
Guys I have a deadline, I have
to show the director the costumes

170
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,464
Fine

171
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,333
Raunak do you need help?

172
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,105
Listen, I've to go,
I have my 'BD' appointment

173
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,304
What's this 'BU?

174
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,109
'Brain Doctor', my therapist

175
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,150
Oh 'BD'... Raunak you're
still going to that 'BU?

176
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,082
I have to

177
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,677
'Brain Doctor'?
Why are you seeing a therapist?

178
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,687
Are you mad?

179
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,182
Who isn't? Look at him

180
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,500
That's a cut, nice

181
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:27,561
Good for you Kaira?

182
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,696
Good for me

183
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,567
<i>Rubbish I
can direct better than this!</i>

184
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,016
Tell me something...

185
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,387
Why did you start
seeing your therapist?

186
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,601
So that you could
tell everyone you're gay?

187
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,366
<i>No</i>

188
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:06,103
So that I could tell myself, I'm gay

189
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,245
When is your flight to Goa?

190
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,754
Don't remind me I can't
believe I'm going to Goa

191
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,220
You're the first human
being who's saying this so sadly

192
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,723
It's Goa! Enjoy

193
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,295
Shut up

194
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,758
And yes it is sad...

195
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,532
Because I'm going on duty

196
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,499
Every 2-3 months
have to go show my face

197
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,770
Raghu?

198
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,267
Duty!

199
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,573
Yes mom, I'm coming tomorrow

200
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,043
What's with this food every time!

201
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,312
Make what you like,
don't ask me I'm busy

202
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,713
Mothers! Same standard
question every time...

203
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,486
'What will you eat' 'What to make'

204
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,494
Either she isn't my real
mother or she's had a memory loss

205
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,358
Kaira!

206
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,523
At least eat my food...

207
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,497
Only way to handle the torture...

208
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,263
I think this time I'll
work on my short film

209
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,463
Short film

210
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,065
The longest project of this century

211
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,073
That's so bitchy

212
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:12,665
It's true

213
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,608
l-low do you like my French food'?

214
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,406
Landlord? I'm not answering

215
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,210
I don't know about French
food but this dip is amazing

216
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,251
Full Indian spice, try it

217
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,015
The dip is from Kaira's fridge
I have made the puff pastries

218
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,517
Jackie, at last you made something

219
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,082
What do you mean, at last?

220
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,752
You film people think that
only you do important work...

221
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,589
and the rest of us are useless?

222
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,624
I have decided to work on myself

223
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,068
That's tough work

224
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,366
Do n, do it

225
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,002
What's wrong with you?

226
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,272
I'm not going to Goa

227
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,141
Guess what?

228
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,441
'Raghu' your friend called...

229
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,280
and I have to shoot
a music video here in 3 days

230
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,148
Now get ready

231
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:56,582
<i>Okay'!</i>

232
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,350
I have never seen anybody
so excited not going to Goa

233
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,948
No Goa

234
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,489
What happened to her?

235
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,223
It's not because of my food

236
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,734
Okay everybody,
just get away from the table

237
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,301
This food is contaminated

238
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,410
<i>Hey Fats.</i> . <i>.you good?</i>

239
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,002
<i>Koko</i>

240
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:22,374
Yes

241
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,572
Guess what?

242
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,146
What's up?

243
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,544
I'm pregnant!

244
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,515
What?

245
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,348
It wasn't Jackie's food

246
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,981
Oh my God Fatty! Congratulations!

247
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,690
I mean we're supposed
to be happy right?

248
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,257
I don't know...
I want to throw up right now

249
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,231
Should I go?

250
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,267
Yes please

251
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,261
No I'm just kidding

252
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,036
I'm just very excited

253
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,639
Are you pregnant too?

254
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:55,309
So I was working on a co-production
with this New York film company...

255
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,705
and it has come through

256
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,005
Thank you

257
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,076
Wow, you are going to be
shooting a feature in the US?

258
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:03,643
Yes

259
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,250
Tell me more...good script?

260
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,015
Superb

261
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,285
Are you going to be
filming 'in' New York?

262
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,156
You are going to
be filming in New York

263
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,491
As in 'we' are going
to be filming in New York

264
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,133
If you're not available
we'll get another camera person...

265
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,295
Oh my God...l will kill you!

266
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,003
Told you, not going to Goa is lucky

267
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,243
Lucky for you, unlucky for me...

268
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,275
I want to kill my husband...

269
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,345
You're sure right?

270
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,613
It's not because
you think I'm hot right?

271
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,452
Obviously... you think
it's because you're talented?

272
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,417
What's wrong with your head?
Why are you so complicated?

273
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,463
You're the best,
that's why you got the job...

274
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,496
Simple

275
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:52,457
Thank you, appreciate it

276
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,469

<i>I</i> 'm a rascal

291
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,433
It's a wrap!

292
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,410
Hi mommy, congratulations!

293
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,040

294
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,183
Cute guy

295

So many men in your life

296
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,084
Shut up

297
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,288
You'll also get to spend
time with Raghu also...

298
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,162
when you're in New York,
shooting for 3 months

299
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,030
Hello ladies, and one gent

300
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:05,763
Oh hello?

301
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,560
Oh sorry two gents

302
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,639
Can I steal Kaira for a minute?

303
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,439
Thief! Even we want to hear

304
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,034
What?

305
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,271
Even we want to hear!

306
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,178
What? I can't hear anything

307
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,313
Okay pose

308
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,088
Nice one

309
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,353
So I'm off to New York tonight

310
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:34,530
What?

311
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,564
Yes

312
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,768
The financiers want to meet urgently

313
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,236
Someone has to fly so that you can

314
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,102
OK go, fly...

315
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,736
Have a nice flight

316
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:50,745
That's it?

317
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,377
Have a nice flight?

318
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,806
What else do I say?

319
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,110
Say something

320
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,747
You pulled me here,
you say something

321
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,185
Firstly stop looking so hot

322
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,151
Tie your hair up

323
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,725
And behave yourself,
just for two weeks

324
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,333
Here you go, happy'

325
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,502
Very happy

326
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,471
l-low do I look'?

327
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,304
Lovely

328
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,205
So I had to talk to
you about something...

329
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,514
Do you want to hit the dance floor?

330
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,613
<i>Hi Justin Bieber</i>

331
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,512
We're just in the
middle of a conversation

332
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,555
Anyway, you were saying

333
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,494
I was saying that...

334
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,389
Gautam i...

335
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,124
Who?

336
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,396
Gautami Sharma will be
the line producer of the film...

337
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,398
OK, so?

338
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,765
The financiers have recommended her...

339
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,806
they think she is the
best person for this job

340
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,513
What are you trying to say?

341
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,110
Gautami and I, many years ago...

342
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,083
were in a relationship

343
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,555
Okay, it's a reunion! That's amazing

344
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,157
Reunion my foot...

345
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,662
It's going to be a
really awkward situation

346
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,632
I mean she was such a weird one...

347
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,362
I don't even feel like seeing her

348
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:25,502
I just want the job to go smoothly,
and I thought you should know

349
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,372
Cool, whatever

350
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,741
What Whatever'? Come here...

351
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:39,613
Anyway I've had someone else
on my mind for a while now

352
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,228
Look I think...

353
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,337
it's time that we got
serious about each other

354
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,402
I think it's time that you go

355
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,639
Do you want to miss your flight?

356
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,278
Kaira I'm serious, I'm not kidding

357
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,407
We really should...

358
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,626
We have a flight to catch...

359
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,717
It's late

360
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,656
Okay Okay)'

361
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,996
Go, it's okay, it's cool

362
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,057
Really?

363
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,603
You don't have anything to say?

364
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,033
No, that's it for now

365
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,577
Bye

366
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:38,646
What did I miss?

367
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,738
Shots!

368
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,250
<i>So, let's break up</i>

369
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,219
<i>Oh my dear</i>

370
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,722
<i>Let's break up</i>

371
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,357
<i>Oh please say yes</i>

372
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:28,021
<i>You and I will never work out,
oh let me go</i>

373
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,515
<i>When I see</i>

374
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,574
<i>A beautiful girl</i>

375
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,284
<i>I get excited</i>

376
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,715
<i>Basically basically basically</i>

377
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,719
<i>I</i> 'm a rascal

378
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:03,022
<i>But you're no less baby</i>

379
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,729
<i>Somedays you're nice</i>

380
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,526
<i>Somedays you're crooked</i>

381
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,268
<i>Basically basically basically.</i> ..

382
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,672
You're a rascal too

383
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:41,102
Koko, why don't you think
seriously about Raghuvendra?

384
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,504
He is so right for you...

385
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,601
This is why some
people should not drink

386
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,576
Why should she think
about Raghuvendra?

387
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,410
Is he the last man in the world?

388
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,676
Why shouldn't she consider him?

389
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:02,217
I will tell you point by point why
Raghuvendra is the perfect guy for Koko

390
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,188
Point no. 1...

391
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,159
And this is the most
important point in the world

392
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,092
He is good looking

393
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,665
Hardly two percent of people
in the world look good...

394
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,406
and if you have to spend
your life with somebody...

395
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:23,639
every morning you should
at least see a handsome face

396
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,642
Point no. 2...

397
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,578
He has a great sense of humor...

398
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,254
and more laughter means more sex

399
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,315
Where are you getting
this information?

400
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,654
Point no. 3...

401
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,059
He understands your profession

402
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:48,431
If you marry a software
engineer or a farmer...

403
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,597
what will you discuss at dinner?

404
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,040
Virus or cow dung?

405
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,078
Hello, my husband
is a software engineer

406
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,237
And we have many
interesting discussions

407
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,008
Like what?

408
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,581
Like a lot of things

409
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,118
And I'm sure farmers
are interesting too...

410
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,518
they can tell us
about organic vegetables

411
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,319
They can tell you
where to get cow's milk

412
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,148
Go, marry a farmer

413
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,524
Ganju, tell them I'm right

414
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,566
Yes, please give us
your male point of view

415
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,329
Guys, just shut up

416
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,028
This is all pointless

417
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:26,303
He's going to meet his
ex-girlfriend in New York

418
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:30,445
Ex-girlfriend! That's just great

419
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,675
Ex is an ex, that's in the past

420
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:35,610
Just punch her

421
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,280
No, the important question is...

422
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,653
are you his present?

423
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,255
William Faulkner once said...

424
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:51,323
"The past is never dead,
in fact it's not even the past"

425
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:54,697
What?

426
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,094
Your 'BD' taught you this?

427
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,698
Hey I want to go to this 'BD'

428
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,226
<i>Raguu!</i>

429
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,434
Take it take it...

430
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,137
No I don't need it

431
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,509
<i>Stop acting pricey...
1 know you like Raguu</i>

432
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,808
No, I don't

433
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:44,820
Take it, keep it, very tasty so yum

434
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,317
Yuck Jackie, so cheap

435
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,583
<i>I love the taste of Raguu</i>

436
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,693
Have you gone mad?

437
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,362
Limited offer, grab now

438
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,166
You've gone mad

439
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,238
Pasta!

440
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:23,116
<i>No don 'I be so desperate,
let him call</i>

441
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,496
New photo?

442
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,764
Yes, nice?

443
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,274
Eat quickly, it will get cold

444
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,276
<i>Raguu Raguu Raguu.</i> ..

445
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,220
Just crush the blacks

446
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,222
More...

447
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,781
See...

448
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,460
Let's Play

449
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,229
<i>Much better see...</i>

450
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,499
Yes, it's looking nice

451
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,232
Okay now pause and zoom in

452
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,438
Ganju! I told you to remind me at 3 PM

453
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,038
I had to take Fatty to the doctor

454
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:23,117
Fatty! I'm so sorry, I'm just leaving

455
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:27,418
<i>No, you wait I 'm coming there,
to eat the canteen Veda Pav</i>

456
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,480
My doctor's appointment got canceled

457
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,292
This landlord...

458
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,225
Hello...

459
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,035
What?

460
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,570
You are not going to believe this

461
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,477
Being single is now a crime!

462
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,405
What?

463
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:54,075
My landlord is kicking
me out of my apartment!

464
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:54,817
What?

465
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,054
I'm going to join the
ranks of homeless in Mumbai

466
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,787
And you want to know why?

467
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,489
Did I damage the apartment? No!

468
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,423
Did I forget to pay rent? No!

469
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,223
The building committee
just got together and decided...

470
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,127
that only married couples
and families can live there

471
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,358
ls that even legal?

472
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,125
This just happened?

473
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,135
Yes he just called!

474
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,398
I've been avoiding his calls for days

475
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,304
Gosh Fatty, I have to vacate
by the end of the month...

476
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,239
I don't know what to do

477
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,004
Damn these people

478
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:25,045
Mumbai, India's most
modern cosmopolitan city

479
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,443
Seriously

480
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,453
Listen, you know you can stay with me

481
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,385
That's not the point

482
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,316
In a way, thank God...

483
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:42,255
thank God I'm leaving this city
and this country for this project...

484
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,261
But seriously what thinking

485
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,269
No marriage means no home for women?

486
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:52,738
Why don't they make this law instead 'no
staying with your in-laws after marriage'?

487
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,237
Forget it

488
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,174
So, when is the New York shoot?

489
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,578
I don't know

490
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,588
I will know the exact
dates in a month...

491
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,582
when the man returns

492
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,318
The man has not called?

493
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,096
Raghuvendra has not called?

494
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,454
<i>No</i>

495
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,065
What 'hmm'?

496
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,005
Why you looking so suspicious?

497
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,667
Fatty? Tell me

498
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,609
He got engaged

499
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,675
He got engaged!

500
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,379
I'm sorry, who got engaged?

501
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,385
Raghuvendra

502
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,284
When?

503
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,283
Last week

504
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,757
Last week?

505
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,556
He was just here,
I mean, he just left...

506
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:52,566
I know...

507
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,103
Who told you? How do you know?

508
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,366
Ajay, that guy from production...

509
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,600
Just one second...
he's not even messaged...

510
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,302
Who told you?

511
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,438
Ajay, from production,
he went to New York with Raghuvendra

512
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,380
He got engaged?

513
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,316
I don't believe this to whom?

514
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,616
Just please, one second, how can he'?

515
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,387
Koko...

516
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,687
God! This is just getting worse

517
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,138
You okay?

518
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,108
It's just the chilli

519
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,050
You want to know to whom?

520
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,029
<i>No</i>

521
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,541
Okay playback

522
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,192
Sorry it slipped

523
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,449
<i>Where do I go from here</i>

524
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,419
<i>Where do I hide</i>

525
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,319
<i>This half heart</i>

526
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,359
How do <i>I</i> share?

527
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,330
<i>We parted from myself</i>

528
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,259
<i>Pm separated from myself</i>

529
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,231
<i>This half heart</i>

530
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,030
<i>How do I settle?</i>

531
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,703
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

532
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,406
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

533
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,380
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

534
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,388
<i>What's your problem</i>

535
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,493
<i>Oh heart, just go to he“</i>

536
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:42,765
<i>Just go to he“, Oh heart</i>

537
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:02,713
<i>Just go to he“, Oh heart</i>

538
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,355
I don't believe this

539
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,295
Back to Goa, back to square one

540
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,497
It's just for 1 month...

541
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,636
then the New York shoot will start...

542
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:15,697
won't it?

543
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,333
I don't know...

544
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,576
Personal and professional...

545
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,010
always keep it separate

546
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,579
You always say this

547
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,445
When will you ever use this?

548
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,185
Such strange things you buy

549
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,551
Damn, I have to live
with my parents for a month

550
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,317
How am I going to do it?

551
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,147
Stay with me...

552
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,725
I'm also going to be in Goa

553
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,423
We'll do yoga together

554
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,521
Do yoga in your fancy holiday house...

555
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,533
I wish my parents would
buy me a villa in Goa

556
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,128
Guess what?

557
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,672
When I reach Goa, I have
to do a beautiful shoot for my dad

558
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,371
Uncle also joined the film business?

559
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,707
No Jackie...

560
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:00,237
he wants me to shoot a promotional
video for his friend's restaurant...

561
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,180
Who knows?

562
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,579
This could be the
turning point in my life

563
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,028
<i>Are you my fault</i>

564
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,465
<i>Or your own mistake</i>

565
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,464
<i>Shamed heart</i>

566
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,969
<i>Please tell me so</i>

567
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,540
<i>What do we gain now</i>

568
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,578
<i>What do we lose now</i>

569
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,514
<i>Shamed heart</i>

570
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,610
<i>Crying is no use</i>

571
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,621
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

572
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:48,486
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

573
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:54,059
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

574
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,106
<i>What's your problem</i>

575
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,734
<i>Oh heart, just go to he“</i>

576
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,077
So Koko

577
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,009
Have you met 'Salman Khan' yet?

578
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,112
Oh my God, 'Sallu'!

579
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:10,150
Is he so handsome in real life?

580
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,651
Does he actually have a 6 pack?

581
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,179
Or is that just how
it looks on screen'?

582
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,050
Tell me Koko, I'm dying to know

583
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,090
First of all,
I haven't met your 'Sallu'...

584
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,459
and if I ever meet him...

585
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,462
I'm not going to tell him...

586
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,161
'Take off your shirt
I want to see your 6 pack abs'

587
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,065
Exactly

588
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,799
Tell us about your ad with 'Dhoni'

589
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,198
One second dad

590
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,714
'Salman Khan'? Abs? Really?

591
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,541
Stop bugging her...

592
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,785
talk about the main topic

593
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:53,120
Yes Ashu,
she should be doing a proper job...

594
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,625
in an office...

595
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,565
something more respectable

596
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,001
That's when we can talk to
people seriously about marriage

597
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,764
Why will she do some other job?

598
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,641
She's done a cinematography
course in New York

599
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,577
She is brilliant at her
job and she's still young

600
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,476
She won't be young forever...

601
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,015
all the good boys will be taken

602
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,073
That's my biggest worry you know...

603
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,353
come baby...

604
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,761
So Kaira, tell me...

605
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,395
Are you a...

606
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,367
Are you a Lebanese?

607
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:43,505
It's not Lebanese', it is lesbian!

608
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:50,083
Yes, are you a Lesbian'?

609
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,996
Oh my God...

610
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:06,396
If I were, would that stop
you from talking about marriage?

611
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,470
Even if you are,
it won't make a difference...

612
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,199
all this gay stuff is
cool in the film industry

613
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,636
You're right...

614
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,201
from big stars to spot boys,
everyone's gay...

615
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,004
we call it 'Gollyvvood' now

616
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,240
Really?

617
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,674
Really?

618
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,582
Of course not!

619
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,012
Do you people even
listen to yourselves?

620
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,681
It's such rubbish

621
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,055
The film industry doesn't have more
gay people, it's just more accepting...

622
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:36,528
there must be many gay
people in your office too...

623
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,531
but sadly they have to hide the fact

624
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:46,138
So, are you?

625
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,567
A 'lesbo?

626
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,550
No, unfortunately not

627
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:00,054
So why don't you settle down?

628
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,990
We're just worried about you Koko

629
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,020
If you keep hanging
with these filmy men...

630
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,130
how will you find a nice boy'?

631
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,098
Filmy men are okay for checking
out abs, but not okay to marry?

632
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,700
How much junk you keep eating

633
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,073
I've made all this for you...

634
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:18,765
eat this

635
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,543
For me? Have you
ever seen me eat this?

636
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,237
<i>I thought you like paneer...</i>

637
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,149
you used to eat it...

638
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:32,419
that's why I keep
asking what you want...

639
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,149
anyway, dinner is put...

640
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,254
come baby, come...

641
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,135
You know Koko

642
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,699
getting married before 25...

643
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,677
can reduce the divorce rate by 50%

644
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,713
There is a 100% chance
of not getting a divorce...

645
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,588
...by not getting married

646
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,646
I'm going to stay with Jackie

647
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:10,648
Koko?

648
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:23,262
<i>Pm addicted to pain</i>

649
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:28,633
<i>Even my tears, laugh at me</i>

650
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:34,239
<i>Why do I give myself new scars</i>

651
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:40,681
<i>Somebody save me from myself</i>

652
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,624
What about the New York project...

653
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,375
What is this question,
'did you sleep well'?

654
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,342
If I say no what can you do?

655
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,712
I don't care what people think...

656
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,249
I'm not going to stay
with you for other people...

657
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,085
don't irritate me please

658
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,756
'Good morning' is it?

659
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,025
Now it's a 'good morning'...

660
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,562
If your night is not good...

661
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,562
how will your morning be good'?

662
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,529
I think I should
be a night watchman...

663
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,034
Should I take an
appointment with a doctor?

664
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,002
Who is that?

665
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:09,568
He moved here a few weeks ago,
to write...

666
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,269
Nice guy

667
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,412
Take an appointment with him

668
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,311
There she is, my talented daughter...

669
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,387
She shoots with all
'Bollywood' celebrities

670
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:22,748
Really?

671
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,727
I know this is a small job for you...

672
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:29,225
but this new restaurant
video is very important for us...

673
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,594
thank you so much for doing this

674
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:31,758
No, it's cool

675
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,501
Actually we should start,
the camera setup will take a while

676
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:37,129
Yes, she is very professional

677
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,572
During work, only work, nothing else

678
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,540
Dad!

679
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,007
Can we stop all these
useless formalities?

680
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:43,771
I need to get this done

681
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,411
I only have a day

682
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,109
Get the 24-70

683
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,550
Tried everything Ganju...

684
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,349
even sleeping pills, nothing works

685
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,251
Try 'Reiki'...
my grandmother also tried it

686
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,593
Shut up and setup

687
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,155
Remove all this,
what's all this rubbish...

688
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,062
I am sorry,
this can't be moved right now...

689
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,605
only after this session ends

690
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,605
What?

691
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,141
We have to wait? Then why call us?

692
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,506
Ma'am, the session is going on

693
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,077
Madness!

694
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,472
National Convention for
Mental Health Awareness...

695
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,446
it's a festival for therapists...

696
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,316
RaunaKs playground...should we go in?

697
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,082
Shut up and sit

698
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,088
Here?

699
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,149
Just sit

700
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,036
I've done a shot breakdown,
you want to see?

701
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,240
I'm sleeping

702
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,641
<i>Dr. Chopra,
therapy, counseling, analysis...</i>

703
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,202
<i>so many big terms...</i>

704
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,339
<i>what do they actually mean?</i>

705
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:59,346
<i>A proper map can be drawn after defining
commonly accepted medical terms...</i>

706
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:03,323
<i>if your prob/em or illness
falls in those definitions...</i>

707
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,190
<i>your prognosis will
tell you your diagnosis</i>

708
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:10,594
<i>it will become clear whether you need
intensive therapy or counseling...</i>

709
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,559
<i>whether you need an
analyst or psychiatrist...</i>

710
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,998
<i>it's quite simple actually</i>

711
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,298
It's very simple

712
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,169
What are they talking
how to understand?

713
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:23,143
<i>Dr. Pereira, how does one decide which
type of doctor they should be going to?</i>

714
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,736
<i>A psychiatrist or</i> a <i>psychologist?</i>

715
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,576
<i>Each model has it's own
strengths and weaknesses.</i> ..

716
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:31,313
<i>Ah individual may find one approach
more appropriate than another...</i>

717
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,746
<i>depending on his
persona! preferences...</i>

718
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,752
<i>and the depth and severity
of the problem presented</i>

719
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,194
If I hear another minute of this...

720
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,360
I'll go nuts

721
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,988
<i>This question is for Dr. Khan</i>

722
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:47,498
<i>Dr. Khan, how do you know
if someone is crazy or normal?</i>

723
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:48,297
What?

724
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,632
Take me for example...

725
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,264
<i>many of you might
think that Pm crazy...</i>

726
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,338
<i>I've come for this formal
seminar in these torn jeans...</i>

727
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,539
so, am <i>I</i> crazy?

728
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:06,381
<i>Or maybe all I need is</i> a <i>good stylist</i>

729
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,255
Crazy! Very scary word

730
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,587
Because here we still believe that...

731
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,387
a problem of the mind
is something to be ashamed of

732
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,463
If you have a problem with your body,
that's normal...

733
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,035
you can tell everyone...

734
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:24,165
'hey I'm in hospital...

735
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,308
with a kidney failure...

736
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,701
lung infection, jaundice'

737
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,639
But if it's a problem of the mind...

738
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,275
then the whole family goes silent...

739
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,045
hush hush hush...

740
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,684
as if the mind is not
even a part of the body

741
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,563
Don't laugh just yet...

742
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,023
the joke begins now

743
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:55,528
Here in Goa,
my parents used to tell everyone...

744
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,536
that I'm a gynecologist,
not a psychologist

745
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:03,041
Which means the doctor's
own family is ashamed...

746
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,679
to admit that their son is a therapist,
dealing with problems of the mind

747
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,515
Imagine my plight...

748
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:16,480
many of my pregnant relatives landed
up at the clinic for a free check up...

749
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,490
and you know what,
I delivered a few babies too...

750
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,723
for the extra pocket money

751
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,064
No, I'm just kidding

752
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:35,168
Dr. Jehangir Khan

753
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,311
Thank you

754
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,246
You'll close it please?

755
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,266
So I'm Jehangir Khan...

756
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,067
but you can call me '.Jug'

757
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,205
May I have a glass of water...

758
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,677
from that jug, Jug?

759
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,083
I'm sure you can
crack better jokes Kaira

760
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,721
May I call you Kaira?

761
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,779
I have only one name

762
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:04,229
So, how does this work?

763
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,669
I have no idea how that works...

764
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,398
you tell me

765
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,766
Can I lie down here?

766
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:15,668
Why, are you sleepy?

767
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,275
I'm not able to sleep

768
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,343
That's the reason I am here

769
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,584
Did you see a doctor?

770
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,209
Isn't that what I'm doing?

771
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,018
You mean the white coat,
stethoscope, pill-giving doctors...

772
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,458
I tried pills, they didn't work

773
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,086
That's why I'm here

774
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:40,397
Sometimes I use this to
knock my patients off to sleep

775
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,100
You're funny

776
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,435
But, you need to work on your jokes

777
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,470
So tell me

778
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:53,140
Any major change in your life?

779
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,279
I just moved from Mumbai to Goa...

780
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,318
is that a major change?

781
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,581
Yes that's a major change...and?

782
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:06,121
And nothing,
the moving out, the settling in...

783
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,728
Or the leaving, the unsettling?

784
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,398
No, that's not a problem for me...

785
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:15,399
I like to move,
not being in one place...

786
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,096
in fact I love to travel...

787
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,334
it's just this sleeping problem

788
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:25,271
So why did you move
from Mumbai to Goa'?

789
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,418
You know...

790
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:40,319
I came to Goa to be
with my best friend...

791
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,620
she's having issues with this guy...

792
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:50,036
who she really likes,
really 'liked'...

793
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:54,599
and she thought he liked her too...

794
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,304
but then he suddenly
got engaged to someone else

795
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,141
So your best friend, is she okay now?

796
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,550
I don't think so...

797
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,181
I don't think she is okay

798
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:10,482
I think her main problem
is her profession

799
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:14,154
She got this dream job,
which is linked to him...

800
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,357
his new fiance will
also be on this project

801
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,991
So how will she handle that?

802
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,567
I don't know

803
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,135
What if everything gets messed up?

804
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:26,003
I don't know what to advise her...

805
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,269
should she just deal with it?

806
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,511
It is her dream job after all

807
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,376
Sometimes I feel I should tell her -

808
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,312
'Grit your teeth and just do it...

809
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,511
you won't get another
opportunity like this'

810
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,176
And sometimes I feel I should say -

811
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,550
'Shut up! And say no!...

812
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,155
don't you have self respect?'

813
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:46,024
So I don't know what to tell her

814
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:51,429
So you are not able to sleep,
because you are up all night...

815
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:57,267
wondering whether to tell
your best friend to shut up or not?

816
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,734
My grandfather used
to tell me a story...

817
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:07,006
please narrate it to your best friend

818
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,145
My grandfather was a mountain-climber

819
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:16,247
Before any expedition,
he would be thoroughly prepared

820
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:20,593
<i>Sadly, poor Pyarelalji
was not like this</i>

821
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,529
<i>Who Pyarelalji?</i>

822
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,328
A very old friend of my grandfathers'

823
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,295
He was also a
mountain-climbing enthusiast...

824
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:33,497
whose life-long desire
was to climb the toughest peak...

825
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,538
Mt. Everest!

826
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,740
<i>Finally one day, Pyarelalji
got the chance to climb Mt. Everest...</i>

827
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,449
with a Chinese trekking
expedition group

828
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:48,213
Without thought or preparation,
he said yes and left

829
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,382
But the group was Chinese...

830
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,652
so they could speak only
in their own language...

831
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,559
no English Vinglish

832
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,158
So the trek began

833
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,532
As they slowly and
steadily climbed higher...

834
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:09,967
<i>Pyarelalji paced ahead of
the group with much enthusiasm...</i>

835
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,074
while the Chinese people kept waving
from behind and shouting in Chinese...

836
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:16,549
<i>'Don't go ahead! hatahau hatahau!.</i>

837
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:20,577
<i>but Pyarelalji thought
they were cheering him</i> oh...

838
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:24,284
and saying 'go ahead,

839
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,092
You can speak Chinese?

840
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,291
Can you?

841
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,055
<i>No</i>

842
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,324
Then this works

843
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,558
Don't laugh, listen

844
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:35,999
<i>Suddenly, Pyarelalji saw</i> a <i>growling
snow leopard in front of him...</i>

845
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:40,007
<i>Pyarelal got scre“"
1 mean he got bloody scared</i>

846
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,373
Now he started waving his hands
frantically and shouting 'Help, Help!'

847
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:47,142
But the Chinese people
thought he is just happy

848
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:52,115
So he kept crying for help,
and they kept waving back

849
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:54,348
Then?

850
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:58,184
<i>Then the snow leopard
ate up poor Pyarelalji</i>

851
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:58,689
What?

852
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,522
Yes he was hungry

853
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,651
You don't find many
people on Mt. Everest...

854
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,191
And the group kept shouting...

855
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,197
'don't go ahead'

856
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,567
What a strange story

857
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,629
No, it's not a strange story

858
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,234
Please tell your friend...

859
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:18,473
that sometimes we choose
the tough path only because...

860
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,545
we feel that to achieve
important things...

861
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,016
we have to take the tough path

862
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:29,054
We feel we need to punish ourselves...

863
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:31,984
but why?

864
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,359
Why not choose the easy way out?

865
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,261
What is so bad about it?

866
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:43,366
Especially when we are
unprepared for the tough path

867
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,573
Why climb mountains
when you are not ready to?

868
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,170
Excuse me

869
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:55,380
You will tell your
friend the story right?

870
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,448
It's important

871
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,030
Okay, I think...

872
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,693
My sleeping problem began...

873
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,632
when Raghuvendra got engaged

874
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,601
Raghuvendra?

875
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:20,973
The guy in my story?

876
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,636
Right, your friend's...

877
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,043
No, mine

878
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:31,382
At least I thought he was mine

879
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,624
We used to work together

880
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,558
Jack!

881
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,071
What are you doing here?

882
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,265
What are you doing here?

883
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:59,307
You don't answer my calls,
you moved here without telling me

884
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,473
Without telling you

885
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,241
Why would I tell you?

886
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:04,210
Who are you?

887
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,254
Actually I have one
thing to tell you...

888
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,646
I've made my decision

889
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,384
What decision?

890
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,258
Kaira, I have to talk to you...

891
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,353
Just shut up, one second

892
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,598
Listen to this story

893
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,469
This man wants to climb Mt. Everest...

894
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,666
but without any preparation
he leaves for Mt. Everest...

895
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,473
with Chinese companions...

896
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,372
and as he's about to fall...

897
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,141
the Chinese people don't understand...

898
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,374
obviously, because they are Chinese...

899
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:35,973
and they keep waving their flag...

900
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,050
and the man is stuck...

901
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,710
and then a tiger eats him up!

902
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:40,347
Got it?

903
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,531
The difficult option
is not the only option

904
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,467
We can choose the easy option
also because the easy option is easy

905
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,702
You know, forget it

906
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,538
It's too much for your small mind

907
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,408
It's a very deep thought

908
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,272
Are you talking about
working on the film?

909
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,312
I was talking about
NOT working on the film!

910
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,784
That's my decision

911
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:15,418
Okay, okay good

912
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:16,751
Good?

913
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,184
Yes I think that's the best...

914
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,522
You think?

915
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,320
Did you hear that?

916
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:23,523
You think?

917
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,399
I have already taken the
decision to not work on your film...

918
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,530
What do you mean by 'you think'?

919
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:37,473
I guess someone really
does need therapy...

920
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:39,604
You told him?

921
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,511
No Koko

922
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,412
Him?

923
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,576
Yes, she told me, so?

924
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,681
And anyway why do you need therapy?

925
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,347
What's the big tragedy in your life?

926
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,286
You didn't want to get serious,
didn't want to commit

927
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,125
So I don't understand,
what is the problem?

928
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,560
You don't understand?
- No!

929
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,690
Then get out

930
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:01,535
Oh God Kaira...

931
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,562
You really need to grow up

932
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:14,477
Good thing you've decided
not to work on my film...

933
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,348
I'm looking for mature
people to work with

934
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,545
What did I just say?

935
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,488
Get out right? Get out!

936
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,360
Bye, see you Jackie

937
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,696
I'm not mature enough to
handle your big fat project...

938
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,167
but mature enough to sleep with you?

939
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,261
Amazing! What a revelation

940
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,600
Kaira I came here to...

941
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,303
I don't want to do this, get out

942
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,139
What are you doing Kaira?

943
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,468
Just get out!

944
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,749
Koko, are you sure about this?

945
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,089
I know with all these
personal issues...

946
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,526
working with Raghu will be tough...

947
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,495
but this was your big break

948
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,328
Okay Jack

949
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:13,037
Sometimes we choose
a tough path just because...

950
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,702
we believe that to
achieve important things...

951
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,069
we have to choose the tough option

952
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:24,679
But sometimes you need
to choose the easier option...

953
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:30,782
because at that time that
is the best option for you

954
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,159
Right?

955
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:38,623
Especially when you are
not ready to face that tough path

956
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,694
Damn! Wish I had said
it right when he was here

957
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,176
You want some tea?

958
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,430
Tonight I'm going to sleep so well,
so <i>well...</i>

959
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,230
Very well!

960
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:42,355
I was at this construction site...

961
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,789
with all these construction workers...

962
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,051
all short and strange people

963
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,523
Suddenly, I lose my balance...

964
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:54,693
and I go falling down...

965
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,260
this big fall...

966
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,734
and land in muck

967
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,972
I think it was a gutter

968
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:10,013
All these workers are just staring,
but no one is helping...

969
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,281
I look up...

970
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:15,484
and I see my camera dangling...

971
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,488
and then suddenly out of nowhere...

972
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,687
this group of newly married women...

973
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:28,327
<i>in saris, pal/us & bindis
all land up there...</i>

974
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:34,197
and they start pointing
at me, laughing at me

975
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,736
Bam! I woke up

976
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,346
It was 4 am...

977
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:44,214
I went straight to the bathroom
and stood under the shower

978
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:45,784
Why shower?

979
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,411
I don't know

980
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:54,720
I felt dirty, I felt
like I needed to clean up

981
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:58,630
So this Raghuvendra,
he is tall and handsome?

982
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,233
That's your conclusion of my dream?

983
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,963
Just asking

984
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,701
You know what I felt...

985
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:16,713
I felt I am ugly, trashy, cheap, dirty

986
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,644
That's funny

987
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,212
What's funny?

988
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,315
I mean...

989
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:28,354
all this from a girl who is
the opposite of ugly, trashy or dirty

990
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:33,155
That's funny... not "ha-ha" funny

991
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,466
<i>Okay'!</i>

992
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,363
Oops!

993
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,172
What's With this?

994
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:46,411
It only creaks when you really like
someone, but can't do anything about it

995
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:56,353
Yes, Raghuvendra is tall and handsome

996
01:06:56,512 --> 01:07:02,326
So you like tall people,
not short and strange

997
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,966
Maybe...Sid was also tall

998
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,524
So there's a Sid too?

999
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,160
Yes so?

1000
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:13,406
So I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1001
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:14,406
you will have admirers

1002
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:15,731
What do you mean?

1003
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,340
What do you mean by admirers?

1004
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,537
I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1005
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:20,512
you will have admirers

1006
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:21,547
Admirers?
- Yes

1007
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,106
You're trying to say
that there are lots of men!

1008
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,310
That's what you're trying to say

1009
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,114
No, what do you want me to say?

1010
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,378
Why would I say that? No

1011
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,513
That's what you are saying

1012
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:33,185
You actually mean that I'm a fast girl, a cheap girl...
- No come on!

1013
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,557
Fast dirty cheap...

1014
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,461
...why use these words?

1015
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,227
Isn't that what the world thinks?

1016
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:43,666
If a girl has more than
one relationship then that's it!

1017
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,222
Kaira...

1018
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,160
have you ever bought a chair?

1019
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,126
What?

1020
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,501
<i>A chair, kursi
have you ever bought one?</i>

1021
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,164
Yes

1022
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:23,107
And did you just go into a
shop and buy the first chair you saw?

1023
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,334
<i>No</i>

1024
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,709
Exactly my point

1025
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:31,179
We look at so many different
chairs until we find the right one

1026
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,456
Some chairs may be comfortable
but look like shit...

1027
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,058
others look nice but
are hard on the butt...

1028
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:43,120
So the process starts,
chair after chair...

1029
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:45,665
how many chairs we
check out before we find...

1030
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,725
that one chair!

1031
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,700
It doesn't creak with me

1032
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:01,671
If we look for so many
options just to buy a chair...

1033
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,144
then shouldn't we look at options...

1034
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,487
when choosing a life partner?

1035
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,251
So...dirty cheap fast...no

1036
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,387
Smart clear fine...actually superfine!

1037
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,131
Wait wait wait

1038
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:22,199
So the women in my
dream who believe that...

1039
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:26,263
marriage is the only
acceptable relationship...

1040
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:29,376
I felt dirty because of them

1041
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:34,312
See? You figured it out yourself...
you don't need anyone's help

1042
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:39,111
But the dangling camera?
What does that mean?

1043
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:43,285
Just like my future,
it's hanging in the air

1044
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,454
Maybe you should sit on my chair...

1045
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:50,122
and I should sit here from today

1046
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,291
It's so cool

1047
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:59,167
I wish the whole world could
hear about your chair theory

1048
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:04,774
Why is it important for
the whole world to hear this?

1049
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:06,679
No I just...

1050
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:11,607
if they understand this chair theory
they will stop judging others...

1051
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:14,120
and what a beautiful world it will be

1052
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,345
No Kaira...

1053
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,054
when you understand yourself <i>well...</i>

1054
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:22,421
then what others think
of you doesn't matter

1055
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:32,127
If you don't take charge
of your own life somebody else will

1056
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:38,745
I pity those who don't shop for chairs

1057
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:45,246
Kaira, will you go
back to your chair please?

1058
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,688
Looked like you wanted
to take my chair home with you

1059
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:53,693
And speaking of home,
I have homework for you

1060
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:54,459
Homework?

1061
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,689
Yes I'm very strict
with my homework assignments

1062
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:57,526
<i>Okay'!</i>

1063
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:00,065
I want you to chat
with your mom and dad

1064
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:02,333
10 minutes with each please

1065
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,200
Please, what will I say to them?

1066
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,599
Time's up, see you next week

1067
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,232
What! We have 20 seconds more

1068
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:13,604
Hey you saw that?

1069
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,342
What happened?

1070
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:17,676
20 seconds happened

1071
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:23,015
I don't like this buzzer

1072
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,125
Homework Kaira

1073
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:30,763
Hey, those are really
nice looking glasses...

1074
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:32,254
Thanks

1075
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,668
You're going to see Jug?

1076
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,295
Yup, I have an appointment

1077
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,734
Really?

1078
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,337
You have problems too?

1079
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,465
YUP

1080
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,572
I am going to get my cycle repaired

1081
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,616
Repairs cycles too?

1082
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:52,583
Hi dad

1083
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,621
Hi darling, when will you come home?

1084
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:55,587
I'll come

1085
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,488
You will be home before
Kiddo arrives right?

1086
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,352
There's enough time for that,
of course I'll be there

1087
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,328
Your mom is in high spirits...

1088
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:05,331
full planning for the party

1089
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:08,596
Obviously, her prince is arriving

1090
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:13,106
Those restaurant guys
loved your film...

1091
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,199
They said it was very well shot

1092
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,705
Oh the hotel video

1093
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,669
<i>Close up of Prawn Balchao?</i>

1094
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,570
Anyway I'll call later

1095
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:22,741
<i>Okay'!</i>

1096
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,243
Bye

1097
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,413
4 minutes!

1098
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,686
Yes Koko, you called?

1099
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,229
Yes, why didn't you pick up
- I was cleaning Kiddo's room...

1100
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,765
I didn't have my phone

1101
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,332
Okay but I'm busy now,
can't talk bye

1102
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,595
<i>Okay'!</i>

1103
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,063
Shift that!

1104
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,176
'Talk to mom and dad
for 10 minutes'...is he mad!

1105
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,314
Beach?

1106
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,733
Are we having the session out here?

1107
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,138
Why not? Problem?

1108
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:22,305
No, but is it allowed?

1109
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,274
Whose permission do I need?

1110
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:28,547
I don't know,
but aren't there some rules?

1111
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:32,379
Like privacy,
closed door, couch and all that?

1112
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:33,779
There are rules

1113
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:38,615
But one should know which
ones to break and which ones to not

1114
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:43,195
Now people will know I am crazy

1115
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:47,496
Who are these people
who keep following you?

1116
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:59,476
Despite the mess, Goa is
the most beautiful place in India

1117
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,440
I wish I could agree

1118
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:05,108
Why? You don't like Goa?

1119
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,044
I was born here

1120
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:13,057
This is where my parents live,
how can I like it?

1121
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,996
Did your homework?

1122
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:18,691
Only half...

1123
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,234
I managed to talk
to dad for 5 minutes...

1124
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:25,161
okay 4 minutes,
but that's a record in itself

1125
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,605
And your mom?

1126
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,673
I tried, but she was busy

1127
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,611
So you've only done a quarter

1128
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:36,410
What did you chat with your dad?

1129
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,709
About Kiddo, my brother...

1130
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,414
he's studying at
the London University...

1131
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:46,721
he's coming home soon, so
my parents are hosting a big party...

1132
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,318
for his homecoming

1133
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,596
When I got here nobody
even said 'welcome'

1134
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,393
So you don't like Kiddo?

1135
01:14:55,457 --> 01:15:00,031
No no I love Kiddo, I really do

1136
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,501
He's the only one
who can make me smile...

1137
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,373
just by being there

1138
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:13,647
When he was little,
I would read him his favorite comic...

1139
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,682
<i>you know Tinkle, have you read it?</i>

1140
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:17,614
Yes

1141
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:23,186
<i>Hunter Shambhu,
Kaafia the Crow & Supandi'...</i>

1142
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,261
<i>So Supandi! was Kiddo's favourite...</i>

1143
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:30,460
So <i>I would rep/ace Supandis
with Kiddo's name...</i>

1144
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,129
and read it to him

1145
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:36,109
He loved hearing the story in my voice

1146
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,735
Even today, he says it's
his best childhood memory

1147
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,446
And your best childhood memory?

1148
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:50,352
Come on, there must be something...

1149
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,516
I don't know

1150
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:59,491
What are your favourite childhood
memories?

1151
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:06,438
My dad used to bring
me here every Sunday...

1152
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,301
<i>To play Kabaddi with the sea</i>

1153
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,704
<i>Kabaddi with the sea?</i>

1154
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:25,083
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi</i>

1155
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,519
Go back!

1156
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,044
Just two more

1157
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:53,745
<i>Okay'!</i>

1158
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:08,162
I can do this all day long

1159
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:14,673
It's important that parents create
happy memories for their children

1160
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,005
Now I am a parent myself

1161
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,710
So I'm hoping...

1162
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:27,045
my son has at least
some happy memories...

1163
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,480
to tell his therapist

1164
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:38,658
He stays with his mom

1165
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:43,127
In divorce cases kids
usually end up with the mother

1166
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:54,042
I just regret not being
able to spend enough time with him

1167
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:05,986
I remember Shaira...

1168
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:09,553
my doll

1169
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,197
My dad's birthday gift to me

1170
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:21,000
When I used to live with my
grandparents, Shaira was with me

1171
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:28,113
I never played with her,
just kept her close to me

1172
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:34,752
At night,
I would hug her tightly and sleep

1173
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,595
You were shy?

1174
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:51,730
Yes

1175
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,996
How did you know?

1176
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:59,612
Shaira-Shy... I'm a genius, really

1177
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:02,012
When I was little I was shy...

1178
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,949
dad used to call me Kaira-Shaira

1179
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,519
But now I'm fully Kaira

1180
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,555
Kaira-Shaira, now fully Kaira

1181
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,588
Yes

1182
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,617
Are you sure?

1183
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,361
Come on

1184
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:26,531
Listen tell me...

1185
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,633
why did you want me to talk
to Mom and Dad for 10 minutes?

1186
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:33,339
Is there some Chinese
mountain story behind this?

1187
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,279
Someday you'll have
to climb Mt. Everest right?

1188
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,445
Where is Shaira?

1189
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,346
Who Shaira?

1190
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:11,677
My doll!

1191
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,447
The one dad gave me

1192
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:15,784
How come you thought
of that doll all of a sudden?

1193
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,182
Do you know where she is or not?

1194
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,383
She may be in the storeroom...

1195
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,188
along with your and Kiddo's old things

1196
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,195
What do you mean by maybe?

1197
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,197
She must be there somewhere

1198
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:28,166
How will I remember
after all these years?

1199
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:33,138
Do you remember anything
at all about those years?

1200
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:37,736
<i>Taste this Bibik</i>

1201
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:39,373
<i>What is Bibik now?</i>

1202
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:42,107
<i>Bebinca! Kiddo's favourite</i>

1203
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,478
No I'm leaving

1204
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:46,075
<i>Pm making coconut laddoos for you...</i>

1205
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,142
your favourite...

1206
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:48,648
see I remembered

1207
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,780
You just want to make me fat!

1208
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,621
Coconut laddoos!

1209
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:02,291
I feel like breaking
a coconut on someone's head

1210
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:07,401
No, no violence, do deep breathing

1211
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,533
What memories will
parents leave behind?

1212
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,338
When they can't remember
anything themselves?

1213
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,246
Let's drink to Shaira, wherever she is

1214
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:37,195
<i>In my street</i>

1215
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,637
<i>The moon that appears</i>

1216
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:42,140
<i>That brings Eid with it</i>

1217
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:45,076
<i>is that you?</i>

1218
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,476
<i>My</i> mom

1219
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,106
<i>Has made me a suit</i>

1220
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:52,310
<i>Has shown me a dream</i>

1221
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,354
<i>is it of you?</i>

1222
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,413
<i>My heart is destroying
itself for someone</i>

1223
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,220
<i>Who is it?</i>

1224
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:01,090
<i>Ifs you</i>

1225
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,533
<i>My heart is protecting
itself for someone</i>

1226
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,296
<i>Who is it?</i>

1227
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:11,359
<i>Ifs you</i>

1228
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:19,635
<i>Who is that so far</i> away

1229
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:24,741
Who is that so close

1230
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:29,682
<i>Who is that so specie!</i>

1231
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:31,746
<i>Ifs you</i>

1232
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,802
<i>The one for whom</i>

1233
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:58,711
<i>I'd break all other hearts</i>

1234
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:01,379
<i>is it you?</i>

1235
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:04,151
<i>The one for whom</i>

1236
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:06,624
<i>Pd go on living</i>

1237
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:09,025
<i>I 'd insure my loving</i>

1238
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,189
<i>is it you?</i>

1239
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,697
The one who's presence

1240
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,062
<i>Makes all come alive</i>

1241
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:15,658
<i>Who is it?</i>

1242
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,670
<i>Ifs you</i>

1243
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:26,177
<i>Who is that so far</i> away

1244
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:31,206
Who is that so close

1245
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:36,153
<i>Who is that so specie!</i>

1246
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:37,779
<i>Ifs you</i>

1247
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:46,254
<i>Who is in my verses?</i>

1248
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:51,559
<i>Who is in my poetry?</i>

1249
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:56,166
<i>Who is in my diary?</i>

1250
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:59,644
<i>Ifs you</i>

1251
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:09,988
Hi!

1252
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:12,486
Oh hello...

1253
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:14,492
That was a beautiful song

1254
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:17,290
You have a beautiful voice

1255
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,357
You totally rocked it

1256
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:24,330
If your audience is so rocking,
the song has to match up

1257
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:28,196
I'm Jackie, this is Kaira

1258
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:32,710
And you are?

1259
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,206
Rumi

1260
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:36,576
Rumi?

1261
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:39,350
Girls night out?

1262
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,385
Yes

1263
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:42,285
They are the best nights

1264
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,789
Hey, great song bro...

1265
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,090
...you killed it!

1266
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:48,650
Did I?

1267
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:52,253
Killed who? We're all alive here

1268
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,591
Girls night, don't mind, cheers

1269
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,231
What a voice you have,
you should be singing in films

1270
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:04,403
Why only films?
There are all kinds of music...

1271
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:09,708
there is rock, pop, jazz, blues...

1272
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,485
do you like blues?

1273
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,748
Blues?

1274
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,683
You seem more red to me...

1275
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:22,726
What?

1276
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,727
<i>Vorresti fuggire con me?</i>

1277
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,501
That was Greek to me...

1278
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,070
It's Italian actually

1279
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:36,007
Does that mean that I'm
so deadly and gorgeous...

1280
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,201
that you can't take your eyes off me?

1281
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:38,710
Not at all

1282
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:43,480
It means that I'm heading to a private
beach with some of my friends...

1283
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,142
to play some music

1284
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,713
Would you like to run away with me?

1285
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,135
Not bad

1286
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,958
Somebody seems to be
in a musical mood today

1287
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:11,133
<i>"My heart is destroying itself
for someone, who is it? It's you"</i>

1288
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:13,332
Excuse me?

1289
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:22,107
<i>"Last night! went
out to listen to</i> a <i>band"</i>

1290
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:28,413
<i>“Which band was it,
where did you go where did you go?”</i>

1291
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:34,057
<i>"The name of the band I don't know
I don't know. ..but singer! know"</i>

1292
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:38,756
So <i>tell</i> me more...
<i>tell</i> me more tell me more

1293
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:43,295
We didn't talk, only music

1294
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,162
What to tell?

1295
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,996
So what was his name? Banjo?

1296
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:52,010
Or the fellow was called Cello?

1297
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:53,676
Rumi
- Wow!

1298
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,305
<i>My new kursi, my new chair</i>

1299
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,217
So, comfortable?

1300
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,218
What?

1301
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:02,343
New chair, comfortable?

1302
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,690
Yes but it's a musical chair...

1303
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,950
twenty four hours will
have to listen to music...

1304
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,018
how to listen?

1305
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:14,022
Why don't you tell him straight,
that you like dialogue too

1306
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,467
How can you tell a musician
to stop the music and talk?

1307
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,232
He'll think I'm a musical idiot...

1308
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,330
have you ever felt like an idiot?

1309
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,636
I've sat through a
three hour Italian Opera...

1310
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,213
pretended it touched my heart...

1311
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,579
when every minute was torture

1312
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:36,316
I wanted to stand up on the chair
and scream even louder than them...

1313
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,251
<i>Pm an opera idiot!</i>

1314
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,091
Wow, okay

1315
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,324
What would you do if you
were dating an opera singer?

1316
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,460
I would say, 'Darling,
I will do anything for you...

1317
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,604
but don't make me hear the opera'

1318
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:55,368
Then end of story right?
She would dump you and run

1319
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:58,570
Or after 6 months of suffering,
I would run away

1320
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:03,410
If one is going to suffer,
the other person should at least know

1321
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:06,451
What is the point
of suffering in silence?

1322
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:10,245
See when...

1323
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:14,724
I'm so sorry - It's okay

1324
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:16,221
I will get a new one for you

1325
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,057
I'll do it, don't touch it...

1326
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:22,298
I think it's safer to have
our sessions outdoor

1327
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:25,970
Go on, Rumi

1328
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:54,323
I like people who smell nice

1329
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:58,000
I hate smelly people

1330
01:29:58,092 --> 01:29:59,469
Really? Why'?

1331
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:02,367
So you like smelly people?

1332
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:05,501
Everyone has a different smell...

1333
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:09,647
that's how people get
attracted to each other

1334
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,047
Eeks! Who goes around smelling
people to get attracted?

1335
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,616
Dogs

1336
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,191
Dogs

1337
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,396
Ya dogs!

1338
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:27,232
Ganju, we should record
our conversations...

1339
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:30,297
they're true genius sometimes

1340
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:30,768
Genius!

1341
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:32,060
Yes please

1342
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:39,605
"Genius is not one
who has all the answers...

1343
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:47,281
genius is one who has the
patience to find every answer"

1344
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,115
Deep

1345
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:51,780
Which genius said this?

1346
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,484
Dr. Jehangir Khan

1347
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:56,388
Khan...khh

1348
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,488
So does he smell nice?

1349
01:30:58,619 --> 01:30:59,825
Who?

1350
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:04,602
There you go

1351
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:09,600
Wait let it breathe...cheers

1352
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,381
Listen to this bit

1353
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:20,642
I love chocolate

1354
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:22,345
Okay this bit

1355
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:32,625
Wait one second

1356
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:37,263
Pink Floyd's first album,
you have to get this

1357
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:46,470
<i>"I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all"</i>

1358
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,207
<i>“§ agree,
you find a place in every heart”</i>

1359
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:52,649
You like strawberries?

1360
01:31:55,476 --> 01:32:03,156
<i>“Yes you are a dream
your every move is a charm...”</i>

1361
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:08,632
"but, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise"

1362
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:21,776
Try some?

1363
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:24,482
Can we just have the music off please!

1364
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:31,784
I'm sorry, I just need some silence

1365
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,430
Everything okay'?

1366
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:45,162
I wrote this song for you

1367
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,797
But it's okay,
silence is good sometimes...

1368
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,338
there is beauty in silence too...

1369
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:52,576
let's be silent

1370
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,023
That's not silent

1371
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:18,093
I'm sorry

1372
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:25,477
Okay play your song

1373
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:27,444
No forget my song...

1374
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:29,343
let's talk about you

1375
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:31,380
I want to know everything about you

1376
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:34,753
Come, sit

1377
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:37,283
Tell me about you

1378
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:40,292
What was your first film about?

1379
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:44,289
When did you decide
to be a camerawoman?

1380
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:45,422
What's your journey?

1381
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,666
You know, I haven't even
shot a selfie in my life

1382
01:33:51,492 --> 01:33:52,596
Isn't that funny?

1383
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,504
So tell me...

1384
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:58,101
I want to know about your dreams,
your inspirations, your aspirations...

1385
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:00,042
I want to know everything about you

1386
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:04,372
Huh?

1387
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:23,194
What's going on?

1388
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:26,594
Shall I put on some music?

1389
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:28,199
Please

1390
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:30,609
I've heard enough for a lifetime

1391
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:35,610
So still suffering silently?
Or did you say it?

1392
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:37,548
I yelled it

1393
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:38,675
So he ran away?

1394
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:42,152
No, he was very sweet actually

1395
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:51,053
He stopped playing the song,
which he had composed for me...

1396
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:54,426
and began asking about me

1397
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,300
I felt guilty at first but...

1398
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:10,380
Why are romantic
relationships so irritating?

1399
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:16,113
With friends,
it's all so easy, it just flows...

1400
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:19,617
you don't need to make such an effort

1401
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:23,652
Who are the 5 people closest to you?

1402
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:25,188
Your top 5?

1403
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:27,021
Why?

1404
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:29,557
There is an important study...

1405
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:31,627
based on the size
of the human brain...

1406
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:36,163
that shows that everyone has about
150 people in their whole universe

1407
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:39,708
The next cut is the 50 who
you would invite home for dinner...

1408
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:44,238
then 15 who you turn to
in times of need for comfort...

1409
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:49,379
and the final cut is of 5
people who are your whole world...

1410
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:52,116
your inner circle

1411
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:56,752
Who are your 5?

1412
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:05,194
Fatty, Kiddo, Jackie, Alka...

1413
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,007
Raghuvendra, no

1414
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:11,107
And I forgot to add...

1415
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:15,511
these 5 people can
also change with time

1416
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:19,573
That's true but these 4
people will always be on the list

1417
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,417
Okay, so think of these 4 and tell me

1418
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:26,219
How do you feel when
you are with them...

1419
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,754
as compared to the changing 5th?

1420
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:34,989
How, how do these
4 people make you feel?

1421
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:41,004
Special, I feel special I feel...

1422
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:45,075
important, I feel respected...

1423
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:48,341
I feel happy and safe

1424
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:52,450
So you don't feel safe
with your boyfriends?

1425
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:55,016
No...

1426
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:58,048
I feel safe but...

1427
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:03,655
I don't know it's not that

1428
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,325
With my friends...

1429
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:13,300
I feel free, I feel like myself

1430
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:15,730
Why safe?

1431
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:20,602
When you start liking a guy...

1432
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,050
What is your fear Kaira?

1433
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:36,651
It's back in one piece

1434
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,257
I believe broken things
can be put back together

1435
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,186
How is the 'Brain Doctor' going?

1436
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:04,450
Is he married or single?

1437
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:05,613
Didi...

1438
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,590
Hi Alka!

1439
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:09,122
Look there

1440
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:13,159
<i>Didi...
how are you?</i>

1441
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,290
Rubbish

1442
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:17,965
Why did you go to the doctor?
Are you okay?

1443
01:38:18,192 --> 01:38:20,103
I went to a 'Brain Doctor'

1444
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:21,672
What happened to your brain?

1445
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:28,742
Nothing, if you have an
emotional problem in your life...

1446
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:31,643
a 'Brain Doctor' can help you solve it

1447
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:34,019
Do such doctors exist?

1448
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,087
Then everyone should go to them

1449
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:40,515
Yes everyone should

1450
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:53,332
<i>I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all</i>

1451
01:38:55,696 --> 01:39:01,374
<i>§ agree, you find
a place in every heart</i>

1452
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:09,551
<i>Yes, you're a dream,
your every move a charm</i>

1453
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:16,391
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise...

1454
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,657
Don't stop!

1455
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:25,135
Come on, play the music

1456
01:39:39,573 --> 01:39:42,679
<i>Heart...be silent</i>

1457
01:39:42,743 --> 01:39:45,485
<i>Don? beat so loud</i>

1458
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:53,359
<i>Let her not see
you suffer</i>

1459
01:39:54,555 --> 01:40:01,131
<i>You will smile now at my state</i>

1460
01:40:01,195 --> 01:40:08,135
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise

1461
01:40:26,086 --> 01:40:29,624
<i>Should I whisper in your ears</i>

1462
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:33,194
<i>Or scream from mountain tops</i>

1463
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:38,506
It was good fun

1464
01:40:38,565 --> 01:40:41,569
<i>We danced to Honey Singh
songs all night</i>

1465
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:42,806
What's happening?

1466
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:44,672
Fatty!

1467
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:47,784
I called you, why didn't you answer?

1468
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,113
<i>Hi Koks</i>

1469
01:40:51,645 --> 01:40:53,716
Why are you both grinning like that?

1470
01:40:53,781 --> 01:40:57,319
Jackie is just telling
me about her new boyfriend

1471
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:58,485
What?

1472
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:00,061
Hello?

1473
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,360
What new boyfriend?

1474
01:41:01,422 --> 01:41:02,492
How about telling me...

1475
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:04,558
I'm right here, am I invisible?

1476
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:05,660
You didn't even ask

1477
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:07,137
Why do I have to ask?

1478
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:08,138
Okay guys relax

1479
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:09,105
How can you not tell me?

1480
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:13,043
I know why, because it's
that weird guy at the bar right'?

1481
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,773
See this is what you do

1482
01:41:15,035 --> 01:41:16,070
You're always judging my men

1483
01:41:16,136 --> 01:41:18,047
I'm not judging,
you called him weird yourself

1484
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:22,053
That was then, now I like him

1485
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:25,056
But you didn't tell
me that you like him

1486
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:27,251
Because you never asked,
you're not around

1487
01:41:27,314 --> 01:41:29,658
How am I supposed to
know if you don't tell me?

1488
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:33,254
You keep doing this
and blame me for everything

1489
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,163
I am around!

1490
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:38,363
Fatty where are you?

1491
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,333
Great you also leave me

1492
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:52,276
Good morning!

1493
01:41:53,173 --> 01:41:55,244
Good morning Jackie Chan

1494
01:41:57,177 --> 01:41:58,451
Anything special today?

1495
01:41:58,512 --> 01:41:59,582
Yes

1496
01:42:00,347 --> 01:42:01,417
Yo u

1497
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:03,661
You're so special

1498
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:09,394
Okay, I'm special

1499
01:42:19,366 --> 01:42:21,573
So you fix cycles too'?

1500
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:23,275
I try

1501
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:27,779
And if I can't fix them,
I recycle them

1502
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:32,416
Recycle a cycle?

1503
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:37,394
Kaira, you have to
crack better jokes please

1504
01:42:39,386 --> 01:42:43,630
So all that cycle
art in your room and...

1505
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,198
Hey, hi by the way!

1506
01:42:46,793 --> 01:42:51,538
This boy was wearing those funky
looking glasses, you made all that?

1507
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:53,441
Finally! You noticed

1508
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:54,808
He's an artist

1509
01:42:56,637 --> 01:43:02,349
If you can't fix people
do you recycle them too'?

1510
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:07,384
Bye Jug

1511
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:09,251
Sorry about it

1512
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:11,094
That's so mean

1513
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:13,529
Yeah that's so mean, let's go

1514
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:18,670
Why cycle today?

1515
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,672
Just breaking the pattern

1516
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:23,207
Yes, should break it

1517
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:27,641
You must be going insane
listening to crazy people like me...

1518
01:43:27,734 --> 01:43:29,543
all day inside one room

1519
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:30,605
Quite possible

1520
01:43:31,071 --> 01:43:32,243
Albert Einstein once said...

1521
01:43:32,472 --> 01:43:34,782
"An insane person is one who does
the same thing over and over again...

1522
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,189
and expects different
results each time"

1523
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:47,757
By the way, Rumi, it's over...

1524
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,200
Why?

1525
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,758
Can't do it...

1526
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:54,436
it's too much

1527
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:57,064
He doesn't fit in my...

1528
01:43:57,397 --> 01:43:58,171
I don't know...

1529
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,041
I can't handle it it's too much

1530
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:01,202
What's too much?

1531
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:02,243
Too much

1532
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:05,144
<i>Wait wait, Lance Armstrong</i>

1533
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,215
Did Rumi do something wrong?

1534
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:15,655
No we were just wrong
for each other...

1535
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:17,423
Not this chair

1536
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:22,127
Shiver! Only happens
when we feel cold...

1537
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:25,667
or have a fever, or due to weather...

1538
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,671
or sometimes people shiver
when they are scared...

1539
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:39,342
I just want to be free...

1540
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:41,682
free from all this

1541
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,347
I also want you to be free...

1542
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:46,419
free from your fears

1543
01:44:46,546 --> 01:44:47,684
Free!

1544
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:50,126
Oh wow

1545
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:54,332
Help me

1546
01:44:55,722 --> 01:44:57,724
Damn, our time's up

1547
01:44:58,225 --> 01:44:58,464
What?

1548
01:44:58,525 --> 01:45:00,163
Got to go! Sorry

1549
01:45:00,227 --> 01:45:01,365
Jug!

1550
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:05,975
Get my glasses please

1551
01:45:12,339 --> 01:45:14,114
My darling boy, all good?

1552
01:45:14,174 --> 01:45:15,312
Yes all good

1553
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:18,618
Kiddo! Spend some time with me now,
not fair...

1554
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:20,590
Sorry, I was getting ready...

1555
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:22,593
you know it's my party,
I have to look nice

1556
01:45:22,749 --> 01:45:23,625
You look nice

1557
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:27,059
So are you part of this matchmaking?

1558
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:27,564
Me?

1559
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:28,429
Yes you

1560
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:32,436
I have no clue but
I want to see the fun

1561
01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:35,768
Sweet boy Kiddo

1562
01:45:36,596 --> 01:45:40,237
And you,
is your best friend Jackie here?

1563
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,406
Is she still single or...

1564
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:48,516
Yes, she's still very
much single and so is Kaira

1565
01:45:49,276 --> 01:45:51,552
Please stop, it's starting to hurt

1566
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:53,454
Kaira, come

1567
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:00,025
I want to introduce
you to a young man

1568
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:02,625
This is my niece, Kaira

1569
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:04,669
Hi Kaira, Suresh

1570
01:46:04,725 --> 01:46:06,102
Suresh

1571
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:07,203
Pleasure

1572
01:46:07,494 --> 01:46:08,973
Well I'll see you'll later then

1573
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:10,372
Alright, cheers

1574
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:11,668
Cheers

1575
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:18,208
So you're a photographer right?

1576
01:46:19,473 --> 01:46:20,975
Cinematographer actually

1577
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:22,314
One and the same thing

1578
01:46:22,509 --> 01:46:23,487
No, it's not the same thing

1579
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:24,317
It's not?
- No

1580
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,254
<i>Okay'!</i>

1581
01:46:26,313 --> 01:46:27,587
What do you do?

1582
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:29,352
I'm a techie...

1583
01:46:31,318 --> 01:46:33,389
does that sound boring?

1584
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:34,056
Fun

1585
01:46:34,187 --> 01:46:36,758
It's fun, then cheers

1586
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:45,276
So, why should I be interested in you?

1587
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,341
That was pretty direct right?

1588
01:46:51,671 --> 01:46:57,781
I can be interesting
if I meet an interesting girl...

1589
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:00,053
it depends

1590
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:01,552
<i>Okay'!</i>

1591
01:47:03,183 --> 01:47:05,663
See Kiddo, your favourite food

1592
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:06,657
Thank you

1593
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:12,595
What a sweet child Kiddo was,
never used to cry

1594
01:47:14,628 --> 01:47:18,269
Never left my side, always 'Mama Mama'

1595
01:47:18,465 --> 01:47:20,672
Well I figured 'Mama Mama'...

1596
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:25,205
was a better way to get
what I wanted than to cry

1597
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:28,219
How fast these kids grow up

1598
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:28,685
I know

1599
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:32,554
Look at Kiddo, he has achieved
so much at a young age

1600
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:36,320
He has got a scholarship
for a higher degree...

1601
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:39,364
then an internship with a big firm...

1602
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:41,092
tell them the name
of the company, Kiddo

1603
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:44,328
Dad, just stop it now

1604
01:47:45,692 --> 01:47:47,569
You will definitely be successful

1605
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:50,207
You are doing the correct thing

1606
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,075
You're not eating anything...

1607
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:56,772
are you dieting again?

1608
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:58,581
I don't feel like

1609
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:00,013
Eat something

1610
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:03,421
Fine, give it to me

1611
01:48:03,677 --> 01:48:05,213
Here have this

1612
01:48:05,946 --> 01:48:10,053
You remember Chanda,
Kiddo was such a gentle, quiet boy...

1613
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:13,457
but Kaira, a real firecracker...

1614
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,500
she's still the same

1615
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:17,327
Firecracker yes,
you're absolutely right...

1616
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:21,964
anger, tantrums and sulking,
most of all with me

1617
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:27,269
You kids have no idea how
tough it is to be a parent...

1618
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:31,040
and it's never ending

1619
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:33,479
Once a parent always a parent

1620
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,245
I agree

1621
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:36,309
No holiday from this job, right Ashu?

1622
01:48:36,376 --> 01:48:38,413
<i>All parents should be awarded
a President's Award</i>

1623
01:48:38,545 --> 01:48:39,455
Huh?

1624
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:40,617
I love the food

1625
01:48:42,148 --> 01:48:43,456
So end it then

1626
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:44,593
Just end it

1627
01:48:45,318 --> 01:48:46,023
What?

1628
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:48,362
The job of being a parent, just end it

1629
01:48:49,589 --> 01:48:53,264
You keep going on and on about
how 'tough' it is, so just end it

1630
01:48:54,327 --> 01:48:56,568
Who has forced you
to continue being parents?

1631
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:57,764
Has anyone forced you to?

1632
01:48:58,265 --> 01:49:03,010
You didn't start the job well in
the first place so why continue it...

1633
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:04,514
just put an end to it!

1634
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:10,947
When kids need you the most
you happily leave them and go

1635
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:12,718
and then complain
about their tantrums...

1636
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:16,085
'Oh how angry she gets, makes faces'

1637
01:49:17,183 --> 01:49:20,357
It was your idea to
bring us into the world...

1638
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,696
you treated us the way you wanted...

1639
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:26,597
and then you blame
us for how we behave...

1640
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:27,570
and you say it's 'tough'...

1641
01:49:27,994 --> 01:49:29,200
What do you mean by 'tough?

1642
01:49:29,262 --> 01:49:30,400
Tough my foot!

1643
01:49:35,702 --> 01:49:37,272
How could you just abandon me?

1644
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:41,684
How could you just do that?

1645
01:49:45,278 --> 01:49:46,723
How could you just do that?

1646
01:49:47,113 --> 01:49:49,354
How could you both leave me and go?

1647
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:53,656
And the only reason you took me back
was because I failed the 2nd grade...

1648
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,563
yes, I failed the 2nd grade!

1649
01:49:55,622 --> 01:49:57,295
Shame Shame!

1650
01:49:57,357 --> 01:50:00,031
Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!

1651
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,533
Such an embarrassment for you...

1652
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:05,372
that you left everything
and came back to India?

1653
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:12,176
And when I was finally happy
living with my grandparents,

1654
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,115
you dragged me away from there too

1655
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:15,611
You separated me even from them

1656
01:50:16,009 --> 01:50:16,783
Yes

1657
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:19,754
<i>President's Award just for that!</i>

1658
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:25,759
And I have a fire cracking
news for you!

1659
01:50:26,019 --> 01:50:27,521
Actually a bomb!

1660
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:28,791
Are you ready?

1661
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:31,562
I have begun therapy!

1662
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:35,766
Yes! I am seeing a 'Brain Doctor'

1663
01:50:36,162 --> 01:50:38,403
So feel free to call me crazy, mad

1664
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:40,706
Please say it to me
right now say it to my face

1665
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:42,043
Say it!

1666
01:50:42,102 --> 01:50:43,809
I'm crazy! 'Kukoooo

1667
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:46,107
'Kaira's gone mad!'

1668
01:50:51,578 --> 01:50:54,115
That's what you think...

1669
01:50:57,183 --> 01:50:58,594
that people like me are crazy

1670
01:51:08,728 --> 01:51:10,366
She is a bit emotional right now...

1671
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:13,335
she is also out of work

1672
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:14,344
Dad, she has enough work

1673
01:51:15,635 --> 01:51:17,672
She has chosen not to work right now

1674
01:51:22,308 --> 01:51:25,414
Kiddo, go get her

1675
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:26,579
Don't worry

1676
01:51:26,646 --> 01:51:28,125
Make her understand that...

1677
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:31,561
once your parents moved back,
she never failed in school again...

1678
01:51:32,485 --> 01:51:35,762
so they took the right decision

1679
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:38,636
There are all kinds of failures...

1680
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:41,465
and I am looking at a few right now

1681
01:52:14,094 --> 01:52:15,072
You okay?

1682
01:52:17,163 --> 01:52:18,369
I don't know

1683
01:52:30,176 --> 01:52:32,156
Were you happy as a child?

1684
01:52:33,379 --> 01:52:35,154
I only remember being
happy once you came home

1685
01:52:41,788 --> 01:52:43,290
See this

1686
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:47,301
Where did you find that?

1687
01:52:48,294 --> 01:52:50,035
I was looking for
something from my past...

1688
01:52:50,697 --> 01:52:52,199
and found something from ours instead

1689
01:53:05,712 --> 01:53:06,554
You know...

1690
01:53:07,013 --> 01:53:10,620
As children, when we are sad,
our elders tell us not to cry

1691
01:53:11,017 --> 01:53:14,055
When we are angry,
they tell us 'give us a smile'

1692
01:53:14,354 --> 01:53:16,095
You know why?

1693
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:18,703
Just to keep the peace at home

1694
01:53:19,259 --> 01:53:22,263
When we wanted to hate
they didn't allow us...

1695
01:53:23,263 --> 01:53:24,537
so now when we want to love...

1696
01:53:24,597 --> 01:53:29,342
we suddenly find our whole
emotional system is topsy-turvy...

1697
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:31,649
it cannot function

1698
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:34,643
Sadness, anger, hate...

1699
01:53:35,275 --> 01:53:37,221
we were not allowed
to express anything...

1700
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:40,014
so now, how do we express love'?

1701
01:53:46,686 --> 01:53:51,032
It's okay to be angry sometimes,
even with parents...

1702
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:52,725
It's good, it's healthy...

1703
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:55,769
it's okay Kaira...

1704
01:54:10,076 --> 01:54:14,491
They left me at my grandparents' house

1705
01:54:18,585 --> 01:54:21,327
Mom told me this was like a vacation,
that I would join them soon

1706
01:54:24,657 --> 01:54:29,367
Dad's export business
in Goa had failed...

1707
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:36,210
so he went to Africa, Middle East
looking for business opportunities...

1708
01:54:36,402 --> 01:54:37,574
mom went with him

1709
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:45,155
In the beginning I was happy
staying with my grandparents...

1710
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:47,658
in their big old house in Vasco

1711
01:55:06,099 --> 01:55:09,012
I would write a letter
to mom and dad every week...

1712
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,106
sometimes even twice a week

1713
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:21,719
At that age, 'writing'
meant drawing some pictures...

1714
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:24,422
trying to write some big words...

1715
01:55:27,086 --> 01:55:30,590
but every letter ended
with the same question...

1716
01:55:33,426 --> 01:55:34,996
'When will you come back?'

1717
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:40,343
I was 5 years old...

1718
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:46,774
every week I would drop my letters
in the mailbox with my grandad...

1719
01:55:47,206 --> 01:55:50,483
then I would wait for a letter

1720
01:55:51,444 --> 01:55:53,424
wait for an answer to my question...

1721
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:00,457
but it never came

1722
01:56:03,523 --> 01:56:08,495
When they called once a month,
they had some excuse each time...

1723
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:15,673
something about 'an address change, no
post office close by, feeling unwell' etc etc

1724
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:20,278
but I still kept writing

1725
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:25,113
And my grandad would keep
walking me to the mailbox...

1726
01:56:25,745 --> 01:56:30,023
he always said that I will
get my answer some day soon

1727
01:56:33,653 --> 01:56:37,157
Then, a year later
mom visited me in Goa...

1728
01:56:39,092 --> 01:56:42,539
with my new baby brother, Kiddo

1729
01:56:46,733 --> 01:56:47,541
I was jealous

1730
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:54,017
Because he got to be with
mom all the time, and not me

1731
01:56:56,676 --> 01:57:02,285
then mom said that I would be away
from them for 'just a little longer'

1732
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:05,661
so I was still fine with it...

1733
01:57:08,154 --> 01:57:11,601
I remember asking my
mom if she got my last letter

1734
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:17,699
she said that it was so beautiful that
she put it up on the refrigerator...

1735
01:57:17,964 --> 01:57:19,307
so that she could see it every day

1736
01:57:19,665 --> 01:57:21,269
I was so happy...

1737
01:57:23,036 --> 01:57:27,314
I ran to my room so I could
write another letter for her...

1738
01:57:28,007 --> 01:57:31,250
so I could see her get
happy in front of my own eyes

1739
01:57:31,511 --> 01:57:34,492
A scene I had imagined
in my head many times

1740
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:39,427
So I took out my colours and paints...

1741
01:57:40,186 --> 01:57:45,363
drew a picture and
ran to show it to her

1742
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:50,705
As I was about to enter the room I
heard my grandad shouting at my mom...

1743
01:57:51,397 --> 01:57:55,607
he was telling her that what
she was doing was not right...

1744
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:57,476
how could she not respond
to my question, to my letters...

1745
01:57:58,504 --> 01:58:01,383
and then, I heard my mom reply...

1746
01:58:03,142 --> 01:58:08,319
"I can't give her false hope...

1747
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:14,361
the truth is that we can't
take her back just <i>yet...</i>

1748
01:58:15,555 --> 01:58:17,432
not until the business is set up...

1749
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:20,631
It is too tough to
handle two children...

1750
01:58:22,061 --> 01:58:24,473
and travel constantly blah blah

1751
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:28,077
But everything just seemed to...

1752
01:58:29,435 --> 01:58:30,175
fade away...

1753
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:40,081
It was a strange feeling...

1754
01:58:43,282 --> 01:58:48,288
like someone had grabbed
the TV remote from me...

1755
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:55,438
and changed the channel from something
I loved to something horrid...

1756
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:59,005
and then threw out the remote

1757
01:59:03,569 --> 01:59:09,076
I went back to my room,
tore up the letter...

1758
01:59:12,645 --> 01:59:13,555
l was 6...

1759
01:59:15,181 --> 01:59:18,355
took a decision as a 6 year old...

1760
01:59:20,086 --> 01:59:24,501
that I had nothing more to
say to them, nothing more to ask...

1761
01:59:31,497 --> 01:59:33,499
I didn't write a letter
ever again in my entire life

1762
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,171
Never

1763
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:43,518
My poor grandad kept
trying to get me to write...

1764
01:59:45,144 --> 01:59:47,454
but I knew I had nothing
to say to my parents...

1765
01:59:49,749 --> 01:59:51,729
or to anyone else...

1766
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:55,690
I just became quiet

1767
01:59:57,723 --> 01:59:58,701
I shut down

1768
02:00:06,299 --> 02:00:08,779
Then a year later my mom said
that they were coming back for good...

1769
02:00:11,437 --> 02:00:15,681
dad's friend had a business
partnership for him in Goa itself

1770
02:00:17,743 --> 02:00:21,190
In all these years, dad couldn't
set up his business abroad

1771
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:26,554
So imagine, all this for nothing

1772
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:30,261
So they came back

1773
02:00:32,258 --> 02:00:36,570
But that year was the
most stressful for me...

1774
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:41,235
I didn't want to be with them

1775
02:00:43,736 --> 02:00:45,545
I wanted to stay with my grandparents

1776
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:49,247
They were separating me from them too

1777
02:00:51,344 --> 02:00:52,652
I threw tantrums...

1778
02:00:52,712 --> 02:00:56,250
cried a lot, troubled everyone

1779
02:00:56,782 --> 02:00:59,058
To top it all,
I failed the 2nd grade...

1780
02:01:00,152 --> 02:01:04,294
and that, not my 100 letters...

1781
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:09,036
not the fact that I was their
daughter living away from them

1782
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:12,432
But my failure made them
take me away from my grandparents...

1783
02:01:13,065 --> 02:01:15,011
and back with them finally

1784
02:01:45,798 --> 02:01:47,709
I'm sorry

1785
02:01:52,271 --> 02:01:53,773
I'm sorry

1786
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:03,117
If you don't cry wholeheartedly,
how will you laugh wholeheartedly?

1787
02:02:03,382 --> 02:02:05,419
It's okay...

1788
02:02:12,391 --> 02:02:15,770
I'm not much for rules...

1789
02:02:16,028 --> 02:02:20,340
but because of the rules...

1790
02:02:22,201 --> 02:02:27,082
I can't pop a champagne
bottle to celebrate this moment...

1791
02:02:27,306 --> 02:02:30,287
but we can do the next best thing

1792
02:02:41,587 --> 02:02:43,294
To letters, Kaira

1793
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:44,357
Cheers!

1794
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:48,297
Go easy...

1795
02:03:02,007 --> 02:03:06,979
To feel safe,
first the fears have to go

1796
02:03:08,314 --> 02:03:11,056
The fear of being abandoned,
of being left alone...

1797
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:16,562
You have carried this
fear with you all your life...

1798
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:27,206
this burden is falling on all your
relationships, especially on your love life

1799
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:31,412
So you leave others
before they can leave you

1800
02:03:31,771 --> 02:03:36,311
You want to say bye
before they can say bye

1801
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:43,350
Because you never want
to face that pain again

1802
02:03:46,218 --> 02:03:47,629
So, Kaira

1803
02:03:49,588 --> 02:03:55,504
Why not say bye to
this fear once and for all?

1804
02:03:57,396 --> 02:04:02,709
Why not say hi to life once again?

1805
02:04:07,273 --> 02:04:12,552
I am not saying that you
should forgive your parents...

1806
02:04:12,711 --> 02:04:14,452
or even to stop being angry...

1807
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:16,459
you do as you wish

1808
02:04:16,749 --> 02:04:18,251
But I will say this...

1809
02:04:18,484 --> 02:04:23,399
try to look at them not in
the exalted status of parents...

1810
02:04:25,357 --> 02:04:27,735
but just as two regular people...

1811
02:04:29,695 --> 02:04:35,373
who make mistakes, like everyone else

1812
02:04:36,469 --> 02:04:38,346
As a child it is hard
to understand all this...

1813
02:04:38,404 --> 02:04:40,350
but now, as an adult...

1814
02:04:40,573 --> 02:04:42,484
you can at least try

1815
02:04:46,145 --> 02:04:53,393
Don't let the past blackmail your
present to ruin a beautiful future

1816
02:05:10,736 --> 02:05:13,717
<i>When something touches your heart</i>

1817
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:18,249
<i>Say hi to</i> it...

1818
02:05:19,478 --> 02:05:23,221
<i>When your heart is not in it</i>

1819
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:27,262
Say bye to it...

1820
02:05:28,153 --> 02:05:30,155
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1821
02:05:30,222 --> 02:05:32,327
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1822
02:05:32,391 --> 02:05:35,133
<i>Say hi to happiness</i>

1823
02:05:36,662 --> 02:05:38,767
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1824
02:05:39,064 --> 02:05:41,101
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1825
02:05:41,166 --> 02:05:48,243
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1826
02:05:48,707 --> 02:05:51,779
<i>Love you life</i>

1827
02:05:53,212 --> 02:06:01,529
<i>Love you life</i>

1828
02:06:01,687 --> 02:06:07,694
<i>Love me life</i>

1829
02:06:26,445 --> 02:06:29,722
Koko, I'm sorry

1830
02:06:32,051 --> 02:06:33,291
I'm sorry

1831
02:06:36,455 --> 02:06:36,990
Hello?

1832
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:39,434
Hi Ma'am, I am calling from eBay,
are you happy with our services?

1833
02:06:39,491 --> 02:06:40,094
Yes why?

1834
02:06:40,559 --> 02:06:43,472
Please do continue shopping with us

1835
02:06:43,529 --> 02:06:44,473
Thank you

1836
02:07:00,245 --> 02:07:07,959
<i>Sometimes hold my hand,
and walk with me</i>

1837
02:07:08,354 --> 02:07:14,635
Sometimes leave <i>my hand,</i>
and let me go free

1838
02:07:17,463 --> 02:07:19,238
<i>I 'm</i> a <i>little moody</i>

1839
02:07:19,598 --> 02:07:21,475
<i>You're</i> a <i>little crazy</i>

1840
02:07:21,533 --> 02:07:25,709
<i>What a pair we are</i>

1841
02:07:25,971 --> 02:07:28,076
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1842
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,245
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1843
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:34,485
<i>Say hi to happiness...</i>

1844
02:07:34,546 --> 02:07:36,685
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1845
02:07:36,749 --> 02:07:38,990
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1846
02:07:39,051 --> 02:07:45,991
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1847
02:07:46,592 --> 02:07:56,274
<i>Love you life</i>

1848
02:07:59,738 --> 02:08:04,153
<i>Love me life</i>

1849
02:08:06,245 --> 02:08:09,488
You are different...

1850
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:15,223
you listen to me, you really listen

1851
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:20,466
I wish I had someone
like you in my life...

1852
02:08:20,659 --> 02:08:22,366
Am I making sense?

1853
02:08:22,728 --> 02:08:26,266
Not at all,
but that will be 3000 rupees please

1854
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:16,059
Where were you?

1855
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:17,723
Just disappeared

1856
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:21,390
I have to give proper
notice if I miss a session...

1857
02:09:21,453 --> 02:09:25,162
and you left me with one small note

1858
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:27,295
'Sorry'... that's not fair

1859
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:30,340
I know, life is unfair

1860
02:09:31,296 --> 02:09:32,400
Fine

1861
02:09:33,499 --> 02:09:34,637
Hide all your secrets

1862
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:42,084
You know...

1863
02:09:42,141 --> 02:09:46,021
my issues with my
parents may get sorted...

1864
02:09:46,311 --> 02:09:50,020
but with men!

1865
02:09:50,282 --> 02:09:52,387
I am never going to find anyone

1866
02:09:59,491 --> 02:10:00,629
Tell me something

1867
02:10:02,628 --> 02:10:07,134
ls there such a thing
as a perfect relationship?

1868
02:10:07,366 --> 02:10:11,314
Like just one special relationship?

1869
02:10:13,705 --> 02:10:15,616
Kaira I think...

1870
02:10:16,408 --> 02:10:21,118
why just that one
special relationship?

1871
02:10:21,747 --> 02:10:24,057
I think one can have
many relationships in life...

1872
02:10:24,116 --> 02:10:26,596
different relationships
for different experiences...

1873
02:10:26,652 --> 02:10:30,657
like a musical relationship...

1874
02:10:31,123 --> 02:10:35,538
someone who shares
our interest in music...

1875
02:10:36,195 --> 02:10:39,369
or the lets-get-coffee-together
relationship...

1876
02:10:39,665 --> 02:10:44,774
perfect to have coffee with...
but not anything else...

1877
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:48,381
Special gossip relationship...

1878
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:51,580
with whom you can
have the perfect gossip

1879
02:10:52,144 --> 02:10:55,148
Or the special
intellectual relationship...

1880
02:10:55,314 --> 02:10:59,057
for all those perfect
bookish discussions...

1881
02:11:00,085 --> 02:11:04,192
So many different,
special relationships...

1882
02:11:08,994 --> 02:11:13,773
The romantic relationship
is just one of many

1883
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:20,100
To expect a single relationship
to take on the burden of every need...

1884
02:11:26,345 --> 02:11:28,518
a bit unfair, right?

1885
02:11:35,454 --> 02:11:37,024
Never thought of it this way

1886
02:11:46,598 --> 02:11:48,373
I'm glad the camera is back

1887
02:11:48,433 --> 02:11:49,741
Me too

1888
02:11:57,542 --> 02:12:03,015
Jug, do you want to get
a cup of coffee or something?

1889
02:12:03,548 --> 02:12:07,223
No, our time's up

1890
02:12:10,656 --> 02:12:13,102
You won't bunk the next session right'?

1891
02:12:13,258 --> 02:12:15,238
It is the last week of our sessions...

1892
02:12:15,694 --> 02:12:17,367
how can I miss that?

1893
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:50,763
So, done sulking with Goa?

1894
02:12:51,363 --> 02:12:52,501
No more sulking

1895
02:12:54,433 --> 02:12:55,810
What about your work?

1896
02:12:56,101 --> 02:12:58,342
Actually I got an offer

1897
02:12:59,171 --> 02:12:59,808
What?

1898
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:04,382
A production company is interested
in funding my short film...

1899
02:13:04,676 --> 02:13:09,648
so I am thinking,
why not stay back here and shoot it

1900
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:26,438
Since it's the final class,
have I passed?

1901
02:13:27,299 --> 02:13:30,644
This isn't school, to pass or fail

1902
02:13:33,271 --> 02:13:36,377
I wish there were teachers
like you in school

1903
02:13:36,742 --> 02:13:38,517
I'm no teacher

1904
02:13:39,044 --> 02:13:41,388
Okay not teacher but...

1905
02:13:42,214 --> 02:13:43,522
you know what I mean

1906
02:13:44,116 --> 02:13:48,121
We are all our own teachers
in the school of life

1907
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:50,591
Okay, that got a bit heavy

1908
02:13:52,257 --> 02:13:57,229
Life is like a jigsaw puzzle

1909
02:13:57,662 --> 02:14:02,202
People like me can help
you find the missing pieces...

1910
02:14:02,367 --> 02:14:05,280
and put them back together...

1911
02:14:06,738 --> 02:14:10,083
but, only you can complete the puzzle

1912
02:14:19,051 --> 02:14:24,296
So now that this is over...

1913
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:33,439
can we meet outside of this...

1914
02:14:34,566 --> 02:14:37,342
just as friends or something?

1915
02:14:37,602 --> 02:14:40,208
No this is not possible Kaira

1916
02:14:40,338 --> 02:14:43,376
And what if I tell you...

1917
02:14:44,042 --> 02:14:45,783
that I like you...

1918
02:14:50,048 --> 02:14:51,118
In fact...

1919
02:14:55,187 --> 02:14:57,258
Go on, I'm listening

1920
02:15:00,192 --> 02:15:02,536
In fact I really like you

1921
02:15:05,664 --> 02:15:08,201
That's it, said it

1922
02:15:12,104 --> 02:15:14,141
I really like you too

1923
02:15:15,307 --> 02:15:17,184
I really like you

1924
02:15:18,143 --> 02:15:20,316
I respect your feelings...

1925
02:15:20,979 --> 02:15:24,153
but my job here is done for now

1926
02:15:24,649 --> 02:15:31,089
As unconventional and friendly
as my methods may be...

1927
02:15:31,356 --> 02:15:35,236
I am still your therapist...

1928
02:15:36,394 --> 02:15:42,606
any other 'friendship' would be outside
the realm of my own professional ethics

1929
02:15:46,438 --> 02:15:53,287
The closeness that you may feel to me,
your 'BD'...

1930
02:15:53,345 --> 02:15:56,019
is very normal

1931
02:15:58,416 --> 02:16:03,024
This happens, it's common

1932
02:16:03,188 --> 02:16:04,132
So I'm common?

1933
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:08,137
No, you are not common

1934
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:10,672
You are different, special...

1935
02:16:11,029 --> 02:16:12,565
you are unique

1936
02:16:14,499 --> 02:16:15,341
You know Kaira

1937
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:22,318
People feel all sorts
of strong emotions in here...

1938
02:16:22,541 --> 02:16:26,114
anger, hate, love

1939
02:16:27,078 --> 02:16:29,684
I shouldn't have said anything

1940
02:16:29,748 --> 02:16:31,659
No, you should have

1941
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:36,089
It's really good
you said what you said

1942
02:16:36,755 --> 02:16:41,500
You expressed your
difficult feelings...

1943
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:46,066
in a straightforward
and mature manner...

1944
02:16:46,398 --> 02:16:50,107
rather than letting them fester...

1945
02:16:50,268 --> 02:16:53,215
inside of you...

1946
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:55,484
and we don't want that...

1947
02:16:55,707 --> 02:16:56,185
<i>No</i>

1948
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:04,118
This Kaira, is huge progress

1949
02:17:18,463 --> 02:17:21,706
Okay but, tell me one thing

1950
02:17:22,167 --> 02:17:23,976
How can this be the last session?

1951
02:17:24,035 --> 02:17:26,379
No no...

1952
02:17:27,706 --> 02:17:29,413
No more stories?

1953
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:33,318
So many new problems I will have...

1954
02:17:34,179 --> 02:17:39,288
Yes there will be many problems...

1955
02:17:39,985 --> 02:17:46,334
but now you know how to solve them

1956
02:17:50,328 --> 02:17:52,604
But I'll need help

1957
02:17:54,232 --> 02:17:56,041
I need you

1958
02:18:03,575 --> 02:18:04,645
Kaira...

1959
02:18:05,477 --> 02:18:07,957
when you see a pattern
emerging in life...

1960
02:18:08,346 --> 02:18:13,989
a habit,
then it's time to think about it

1961
02:18:14,386 --> 02:18:17,629
Genius is about knowing when to stop

1962
02:19:24,522 --> 02:19:25,694
Okay then

1963
02:21:28,279 --> 02:21:33,251
Baby Fatima, can't believe it

1964
02:21:36,054 --> 02:21:41,402
<i>This is your godmother, Kokomaa</i>

1965
02:21:49,634 --> 02:21:52,581
Battle after battle

1966
02:21:53,238 --> 02:21:58,119
Corporal Balthazar fought
in the Portuguese army for 14 years

1967
02:21:59,611 --> 02:22:04,026
Nobody knew that Corporal
Balthazar was not Balthazar...

1968
02:22:04,082 --> 02:22:07,086
but Dona Maria, a woman...

1969
02:22:07,452 --> 02:22:10,365
disguised as a man

1970
02:22:10,622 --> 02:22:16,595
This was the only way for a woman
to safeguard her life and dignity

1971
02:22:16,761 --> 02:22:20,334
For 14 years Dona Maria
fought two battles...

1972
02:22:20,398 --> 02:22:24,210
one on the battlefield,
and the other with herself...

1973
02:22:24,402 --> 02:22:27,315
with her fears

1974
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:30,649
Finally, one day on the battlefield,
her true identity was revealed

1975
02:22:31,142 --> 02:22:32,177
As fate would have it...

1976
02:22:32,310 --> 02:22:35,086
in front of Captain Aphonso...

1977
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:42,460
Captain Aphonso...

1978
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:45,294
Commander of the fort and a doctor...

1979
02:22:45,456 --> 02:22:47,094
not only saved Dona Maria's life...

1980
02:22:47,158 --> 02:22:48,364
and nursed her wounds...

1981
02:22:48,493 --> 02:22:51,133
but made her fears disappear...

1982
02:22:51,763 --> 02:22:55,734
and freed her from the
ghost of Corporal Balthazar

1983
02:22:58,169 --> 02:22:59,773
For the first time...

1984
02:23:00,038 --> 02:23:02,746
Dona Maria had the courage
to face her true self

1985
02:23:03,474 --> 02:23:08,014
Finally she felt free, she felt alive

1986
02:23:10,381 --> 02:23:17,299
With her new found courage,
Dona Maria soon became Commander...

1987
02:23:17,488 --> 02:23:21,129
the first woman Commander
of the Portuguese army...

1988
02:23:23,194 --> 02:23:25,572
Now, Donna Maria fought
only one battle...

1989
02:23:26,264 --> 02:23:29,575
the one on the battlefield

1990
02:24:23,087 --> 02:24:24,566
Speech! Speech!

1991
02:24:24,622 --> 02:24:27,535
No speech, just shut up!

1992
02:24:28,693 --> 02:24:31,173
It was beautiful my darling

1993
02:24:33,064 --> 02:24:35,066
So proud of you

1994
02:24:39,537 --> 02:24:40,709
Beautiful film

1995
02:24:41,172 --> 02:24:41,479
Really?

1996
02:24:41,572 --> 02:24:42,448
Very impressed

1997
02:24:43,675 --> 02:24:47,145
People who make music with
the camera don't need musicians

1998
02:24:50,214 --> 02:24:52,558
I wrote a song for you,
want to listen?

1999
02:24:53,351 --> 02:24:54,625
Just kidding

2000
02:24:56,421 --> 02:24:57,491
I'm proud of you

2001
02:24:58,256 --> 02:25:00,497
You gave Kaira her first break right?

2002
02:25:00,558 --> 02:25:01,502
Yes

2003
02:25:01,592 --> 02:25:03,731
She could not have
done this without you

2004
02:25:03,995 --> 02:25:08,535
Actually if I was with her,
she couldn't have done this

2005
02:25:09,534 --> 02:25:11,172
Cheers!

2006
02:25:12,003 --> 02:25:14,574
To the longest project
of this century!

2007
02:25:16,007 --> 02:25:17,247
Cheers to my baby

2008
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:23,351
Hi!

2009
02:25:23,414 --> 02:25:24,392
Hi!

2010
02:25:25,650 --> 02:25:26,720
I was wondering...

2011
02:25:27,051 --> 02:25:30,055
Yes please tell me,
what were you wondering?

2012
02:25:30,254 --> 02:25:32,359
Would you be able to
live as a man for a few years?

2013
02:25:32,623 --> 02:25:33,567
Huh?

2014
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:37,597
It's a really interesting concept,
your story

2015
02:25:39,564 --> 02:25:40,770
How did you come up with the idea?

2016
02:25:43,034 --> 02:25:43,603
What's your story?

2017
02:25:45,036 --> 02:25:47,642
Do you make films too?

2018
02:25:47,705 --> 02:25:49,446
No, I make furniture...

2019
02:25:50,074 --> 02:25:52,645
tables, sofas, chairs

2020
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:54,515
Chairs?

2021
02:25:56,114 --> 02:25:58,219
<i>Like Kursi chairs?</i>

2022
02:25:58,649 --> 02:26:00,424
<i>Chairs like Kursi</i>

2023
02:26:00,952 --> 02:26:02,954
<i>Kursi like chairs</i>

2024
02:26:40,591 --> 02:26:41,763
Dear life,

2025
02:26:42,727 --> 02:26:45,606
I know we haven't been
in touch for a while...

2026
02:26:46,664 --> 02:26:48,007
So nothing

2027
02:26:48,699 --> 02:26:50,042
Just wanted to say hi

2028
02:27:03,514 --> 02:27:07,985
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi.</i> ..
