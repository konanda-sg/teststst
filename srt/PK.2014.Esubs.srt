<u>Fixed&Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick.</u>

2
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,346
How many stars in the sky.

3
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:51,086
Have you ever tried to count it?

4
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,800
If you try to count it, then...

5
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:58,601
It's about 6,000 billion at least.
That too just in our galaxy.

6
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,085
And how many such
galaxies in all?

7
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:05,688
Scientists say maybe it
is two billion or more.

8
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,327
Therefore, what if in these
so many planets.

9
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,709
There's probably someone
somewhere in...

10
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:15,311
Some planet that's look
just like us.

11
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:20,071
And like us, who's trying
to go to the Moon and Mars...

12
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:24,341
They too searching
for us and come here...

13
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:16,004
<b>Rajasthan - India.</b>

14
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:17,734
The thing that was stolen
is for calling back the spaceship...

15
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,567
Without the remote control, he can
never go back to his home planet...

16
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:24,344
He does not know our language...

17
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:26,558
And he does not have
any friends here...

18
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,827
Alone, helpless, he thought
about just one thing...

19
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,221
Now, how can I go home?

20
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,000
Sorry, but I raise
my hand first.

21
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh, sorry, but I ask first...
After that you came.

22
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,076
I'm a big fan of Raleigh
Rai Bachchan.

23
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,962
But I am a big fan
of Amitabh Bachchan.

24
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:58,100
I have read all the poems he's
written since 10 years...

25
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,343
From the age of five I memorized
all of his dialogue, that too without radio.

26
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:05,517
Who want this, final? -Give it to me,
he will not understand any poet.

27
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:06,976
100 Euros.

28
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,921
40 price, sell 100?

29
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:13,048
That too forged ticket? -Since
it took over 6 hours of queue.

30
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,610
Time is money.

31
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,134
You listen then...

32
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,471
No, no, you listen.
Ladies first...

33
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:30,368
Wait, what do you say
we split together?

34
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,027
First you hear poetry...

35
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:35,730
After free time, I see Amitabh sir...
Please...

36
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:40,293
That's a damn good idea!

37
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,688
10... 20... 30... 40

38
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,132
- 50... 6...
- 96

39
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,163
There are 96.

40
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:53,083
Small discount please. We're
from same country after all...

41
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:56,939
Motherland. Live! Bro...
Yes, long live... 100 Euros.

42
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,015
Can you lend 4 euro please?

43
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,570
You can take the watch
for that money.

44
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:12,558
Please Uncle, last ticket.

45
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:16,431
Its Full House already, you
won't get any tickets.

46
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,406
No Uncle, there's one Hero,
selling forged tickets.

47
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,842
Rascals...

48
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,881
People like him will tarnish
our country's name. -Right?

49
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:29,459
Boy, you stay here,
I'll get you tickets.

50
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,959
Thanks.

51
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:55,518
Uncle...

52
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,977
Who? -You ask who?
Where are my tickets?

53
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,184
Oh. Tickets?

54
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,795
100 Euro.

55
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,961
Bloody cheater...

56
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,754
You bastard, liar, shmucks...

57
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:09,301
Mind your language. -Mind
your language? To hell!

58
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:14,443
- Guards.
- Now go look inside... old man.

59
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:17,316
Come... come... come.

60
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,713
I'll take care of you.

61
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,324
- Go go go go.
- Cursing the girl.

62
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:25,221
Let me catch that old man...

63
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,213
Today, when...

64
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:41,942
What kind of generation...

65
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:43,393
Just give it up.

66
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:44,846
Never mind it...

67
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:46,608
How can I give up ...?

68
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:50,076
He's listening to good poem now
and I'm sitting here. -Give it up...

69
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:54,758
The past often hurt
out memories...

70
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,471
The future is waving its hand...

71
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:57,973
Come forward with me
toward it...

72
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:00,998
Me too write
a little here and there.

73
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,287
That's good. Tell
the rest of them.

74
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,247
No, cannot say the rest.

75
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,177
If you listen to the rest...

76
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:09,872
You'll end up proposing me.

77
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,546
- Are you crazy?
- No, really...

78
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,172
You really like Sir Rai
Bachchan...

79
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:17,735
Woman found him
in the morning...

80
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:19,245
He sang the words
of his poems...

81
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:20,886
By evening she married him.

82
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,330
- I've read it.
- Really?

83
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,243
What else?
Twelve waiting...

84
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:25,822
Just see...

85
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:27,543
Amitabh Bachchan.

86
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,208
Jaggu.

87
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:32,749
Jaggu...?

88
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:34,385
My name.

89
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,739
Papa put a long name to me...

90
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:37,932
Jhaggat Jhannani.

91
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,319
Everyone made fun
of that at the school.

92
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:41,478
- So I cut it short.
- Jaggu.

93
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:44,493
You live here?

94
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,805
No, Delhi. I'm hosting
a TV production here.

95
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,910
- And you?
- I'm Sarfaraz, study architecture here and doing part time job.

96
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,951
Here, at the Pakistan embassy.

97
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:56,387
Why Pakistan Embassy ...?

98
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,672
Because... I'm a Pakistani.

99
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,434
So, I cannot get a job
at Indian embassy right?

100
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:06,061
What happened ...?

101
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:08,067
No... nothing.

102
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:13,455
Pakistan mentioned...

103
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:15,613
And smile was gone ...?

104
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,613
Well then... God bless you.

105
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,659
Thanks.

106
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,460
Mom, Dad...

107
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,396
She's falling in love.

108
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:34,364
Fall in love?

109
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:36,769
He is so cute.

110
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,427
Come, show the picture.

111
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,236
What do the boy do? Not
a joint family, right ...?

112
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:45,053
Calm, I tell you everything.
First, What his name?

113
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:47,584
Sarfaraaz.

114
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,670
A Muslim?

115
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:53,115
Yes, Dad, study in architecture.

116
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,702
Family in Pakistan.

117
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,892
Pakistan... what Pakistan?

118
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:58,913
Mom... there's just
one Pakistan.

119
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:02,286
Over my dead body...

120
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,683
Do not disconnect. Do not move.
Hold on. I will be quick.

121
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,657
Lord, it will be
a catastrophe...

122
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:09,681
Please help.

123
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:12,244
I knew where Papa was going...

124
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:16,999
Ever since I'm a child, I saw Mr.Tapaswy
face... more than I saw my parents faces...

125
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:18,124
Bye Mom...

126
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,298
From school bag to home
bathroom wall, everywhere...

127
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,623
Mr.Tapaswi
is all over the place.

128
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:30,154
Good time for him to get lost.
Not protect the tooth.

129
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,756
Tapaswi has given father
a box of Gods.

130
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:38,557
For each task there's a god.

131
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:43,057
When Dad doing stock transaction,
he showed Lakshmi the computer screen.

132
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,311
While at treadmill, its
Hanuman he brought up.

133
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:52,009
Internet, Online,
blessing, all Mr.Tapaswi.

134
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:54,715
All these things
is because of Tapaswi.

135
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:10,963
Jaggu, come take blessing...

136
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,963
Why Jaggath Jhananni...

137
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,519
Why you want suicide...

138
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,010
Take down pencil.

139
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,248
And write... O Lord.

140
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,002
Please help...

141
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:38,199
Yes...

142
00:18:40,468 --> 00:18:41,491
Alright...

143
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
God... what you say.

144
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:47,292
Look at the reality
Jaggath Jhandni.

145
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:49,474
This Pakistani youth.

146
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:51,950
Which name is Sarfaraaz...

147
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:54,299
He will lie to you.

148
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,267
Sarfaraaz will not cheat on me.

149
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,298
Boy, bear witness to history.

150
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,885
These people is not doing
anything but lies.

151
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,091
He will take advantage on you.

152
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:12,289
He'll use you
but will not marry you.

153
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,765
Jaggu come home immediately.

154
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:17,281
If one more night you're there,
our relationship is over.

155
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,305
Sahani, sir...

156
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,066
I'll talk with the children.

157
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:21,556
Child...

158
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,278
Press the delete button.

159
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:26,571
And get him off your system.

160
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,030
Hello...

161
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:36,766
What happened ...?

162
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:39,686
Do you love me?

163
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:42,400
Of course I do, why?...

164
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,582
Will you marry me?

165
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:47,407
Hello, but what happened ...?
Yes or no, Sarfaraaz?

166
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,613
- Yes... b... but...
- tomorrow.

167
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,041
Tomorrow?

168
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:52,844
Tomorrow we will get married.

169
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:56,834
Mr.Tapaswi's prophecy is wrong.

170
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:58,794
I'll prove it.

171
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,481
Sir James Herrick and Miss Oprah
Brown, you are next

172
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,274
James isn't here yet.

173
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:17,885
Ah... talk to the Registrar.

174
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:22,572
Could you just hold this please...
Of Course.

175
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,050
This is for you...

176
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:30,010
- For me?
- Yeah.

177
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:31,534
Thanks.

178
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:38,144
It's a letter from Sarfaraaz.

179
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,183
We can't continue
because of our family...

180
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:44,960
Our countries, religions, people,
everything is different.

181
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,112
How can we be happy together?
We can't.

182
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:50,237
Do not try to contact me.

183
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,823
Sorry.

184
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,312
Where to go, young lady?

185
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:16,217
New Delhi.

186
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,684
New Delhi. Six months later...

187
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:21,866
I returned to my city...

188
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,136
But my father didn't
want me at home.

189
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,286
I join the news channel now.

190
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,976
Boss ordered to bring any dog.

191
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:30,653
He want to make it
a breaking news.

192
00:21:31,015 --> 00:21:32,348
Haven't got any new news.

193
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:34,057
Sometimes had to make
up some news.

194
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:55,853
Disappeared.

195
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,029
Missing.

196
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:00,965
If found please contact PK.

197
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,400
That man, a good story.

198
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,355
You go to the office.
I'll come later.

199
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:09,549
Come quickly.

200
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:24,444
Excuse me.

201
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,868
Why do you give these out?

202
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,224
My case is not
solved yet with him.

203
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:31,285
He do not contact me
and hadn't been found.

204
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:33,351
My life has been destroyed.

205
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:37,191
Don't even know
what world he go to sit.

206
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,659
You got any idea where is he?

207
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:43,603
No.

208
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:03,931
Why are you wearing this helmet?
I've learnt one thing.

209
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:08,010
This yellow color, can
be seen from afar.

210
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:11,391
Despite huge traffic, one know
a taxi even from far.

211
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,875
- So?
- So God can find me from far.

212
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:18,359
Or else, how would He know
me from among the crowd?

213
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:30,056
Yes, to the left side.
OK, Perfect.

214
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:31,706
Background...

215
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:33,389
Jaggu, que.

216
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:36,865
Who said that animals
don't commit suicide.

217
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:38,873
This is Nikku.

218
00:23:39,237 --> 00:23:41,784
Dr. Sweetie Singh's dog
from Ramesh Nagar, Delhi.

219
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,617
In the last month, it have
attempt suicide three times.

220
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:49,291
Try to jump off the roof,
ate sleeping pills,

221
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,513
And throw itself in fireplace.

222
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,743
Why did it do these things?

223
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:57,092
Is it have some mental illness?

224
00:23:58,179 --> 00:23:59,187
Is Nikku...

225
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,687
Jaggu, what happened?

226
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,830
What's this shit, Nitu?

227
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:15,098
We hope to talk more with the millionaire,
but after the break.

228
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:18,534
Well done. Coffee?

229
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:20,732
Bring coffee here, someone...

230
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:21,756
Jerry.

231
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:25,033
- Oh no.
- What do you think? This dog have depression?

232
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,874
And psychotic disorder, schizophrenia
tension deficit hyperactive disorder.

233
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:33,175
Whatever it is,
why would I care?

234
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:34,992
Exactly!
Why would anyone care?

235
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,420
So why show this
stupid news to people?

236
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,229
So what you trying to say?

237
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:43,459
Come here, take this.

238
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:47,371
Look at this. Today,
I met someone.

239
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,593
Who gives these
pamphlets to people.

240
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,847
He's looking for God.
He found Him?

241
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:53,981
No.

242
00:24:54,274 --> 00:24:56,045
Finding God, that's religion.

243
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,007
Found God, that's news.

244
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,504
If he found God then bring
him here, I'll put him on.

245
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:03,758
You know its company policy.

246
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:06,369
No news on religion and no
news on God. Finish.

247
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,385
What is wrong with you ...?

248
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:11,012
Where are the so called
fighter once before?

249
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,369
You wanna see the fighter.

250
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:14,948
Look here. Look at this.

251
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:18,614
There are three marks here. See?

252
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,891
They are not birthmarks.

253
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:23,168
Your father's friend,
that Tapaswi?

254
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:26,572
I have news program against him.

255
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:29,375
It's his devotees shoot my butt.
Yeah. Right in my bump.

256
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:34,381
From then on, I decided, if I want
to live in this country...

257
00:25:34,627 --> 00:25:36,404
Then do not mess with religion.
That's it.

258
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:38,904
I have a show now. You can go.
Bye bye.

259
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:44,474
Welcome come back from the break,
we were talking about businessman...

260
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:48,577
Boss never give me the opportunity
to follow up this story...

261
00:25:48,972 --> 00:25:52,821
But two weeks later, it
came back to my life story.

262
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,569
A thief... thief... thief.

263
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:48,107
Catch him. He steal
money from the box.

264
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,466
Hey... Where are you going?

265
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,545
Catch him.

266
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,981
Get away.

267
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:16,932
You idiot, dare
stealing from God?

268
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:19,519
Pandit... He is not a thief.

269
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:22,900
My purse fell through the box
when I want to give money in it.

270
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:25,408
He's helping me to get
it, that's all.

271
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,805
I'm telling the truth. Check it.

272
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,900
In the purse there's Rs 5,000.
You'll see.

273
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:50,317
Pandit... Those are mine.

274
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,928
Once, but when He
was named in your hands.

275
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,039
Now they are His.

276
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,888
Let them leave.

277
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:58,157
Hey...

278
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:00,966
What did you do there? I'm
taking my money back.

279
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,839
Payment has been taken, but didn't
do the work. -No, no wait.

280
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:09,400
I saw you begin to get some money,
and then you put some money back.

281
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:13,797
Rs200 for the register, I take that amount
from it and return the balance back in.

282
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:17,592
Before this, you wear
necklaces, rings, wasn't

283
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:19,589
you.? I reject it.
Now I won't wear it.

284
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:21,673
Then why are you wearing
these stickers?

285
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:24,255
Self-defense.

286
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,072
People always put Gods photo
in their wall, right?

287
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:31,564
So that someone would not kick it... I stick
it here. So that people won't hit me.

288
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,803
Nitu, where are you?

289
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:42,342
Come fetch me, I don't
have money to go home.

290
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,564
I'll tell you
what happened later.

291
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:47,992
There's a big temple
opposite that place.

292
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:50,119
Come quickly... Thanks... bye.

293
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,373
Take this. Keep it.

294
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:56,150
What's this? -For taxi,
so you can go home.

295
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:59,213
When I see somebody
couldn't go home.

296
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:01,871
I feel disheartened.

297
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,220
Listen. No more,
That's all I have.

298
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,546
No. I cannot take this.

299
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,847
Why? -You have to go
to your home too right?

300
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,640
And you don't have
any money too.

301
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,211
Even with money, I...

302
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:21,393
Still can't go home...

303
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:23,853
Why?
Where do you live?

304
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:33,715
Actually I...

305
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,927
Live in Bhauri...

306
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:40,054
But these days, the hotel
rent are high, you know...

307
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:42,466
So I have to Check
in at lock up.

308
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:44,124
Lock up?

309
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:48,053
As in the police lock up?
Yes, here in Delhi...

310
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:52,830
They give food for free - And you
want to check in there? Like a hotel?

311
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:55,933
Come, I'll show you.

312
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:06,236
Stay here.

313
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:13,561
Hey, look at this, idiot...

314
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,956
I'll take care of you.

315
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,415
Jaggu.

316
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:47,465
You sit behind.
I'll follow that car.

317
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:50,385
- Who's car ...?
- Our story.

318
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,561
Get your purse...
Need some money.

319
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:10,394
Hurry Nitu.

320
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Thank you, bye.

321
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:24,742
Excuse me.

322
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:29,091
- Yes.
- I want to go into the lock up.

323
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:30,869
Why?

324
00:31:32,153 --> 00:31:33,392
To meet that guy.

325
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:38,281
Lady, does this look
like a canteen to you?

326
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:41,963
Where you can eat and drink, have
fun with friends as you please?

327
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:43,828
This is lock up. Lock up.

328
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:47,883
Only someone who is faulty
is able to go in.

329
00:31:48,661 --> 00:31:52,176
Ma'am, bribe is banned.

330
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,668
That's why I give it.

331
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:58,604
You can even be put in.
Oh please do it.

332
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,554
Thank you, Mr. Pandit.
Just an hour.

333
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:10,554
Hi.

334
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:13,966
I want to know your story.

335
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:15,703
Tell me.

336
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:18,425
What is it?

337
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:21,029
I'm a TV reporter.
This is my job.

338
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:35,351
Ask.

339
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:38,113
Whatever you want to ask.

340
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:44,818
So...

341
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,310
What's your name?

342
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:48,476
I don't have name.

343
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,222
All I know is everyone
call me PK, PK.

344
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:52,674
What's your job?

345
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:57,755
Ash toro naut...
(ASTRAUNAUT)

346
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:01,484
Astronaut?

347
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,578
Meaning, job which go
to the Moon?

348
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:07,498
Moon miner... do not work.
Not trustworthy.

349
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:13,427
OK... so what's your favorite
planet, then?

350
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:16,855
My planet. No, no,
beside Earth...?

351
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,093
No, I know this
planet's a beauty.

352
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,220
I said my own planet.

353
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:29,330
At night, that's up there.
I can see my home.

354
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:32,004
We're surprised when
we learned that...

355
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:36,646
There are another world,
people just like us.

356
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,310
So they sent me here,
for research purpose.

357
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:42,415
But when I just got here.

358
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,946
Someone snatched
my remote control.

359
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:49,200
And without remote control
I can't give signals to my home.

360
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,739
Without signals, no one can
come and take me home...

361
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,730
Hello... Listen.

362
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:08,531
What ...? Open the door please.
I want to go home.

363
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:11,951
Madam, that can be decide by party
from outside, not from inside.

364
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:15,197
Look I'm not a thief.
That's what thieves always said.

365
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:19,038
Where Mr. Pandit? Please call him.
Mr. Pandit went on patrol.

366
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:21,196
Mr. Pandit.

367
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:25,933
- Pandit.
- Hey thief, shut up. Or I'll give...

368
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,210
You think I'm crazy,
talking nonsense?

369
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:50,654
If not then what?

370
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:55,304
Your planet people talking like BHOJPURI
(LANGUAGE FROM Indian STATE BIHAR)?

371
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:58,851
Our world did not
have any language...

372
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:01,858
We all are talking with mind,
never arouse confusion.

373
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,818
But here, say something else
but meant something else.

374
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:06,643
One word but four meaning.

375
00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:10,301
When saying something
good, it's like...

376
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:12,475
Everything is good, very good.

377
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,529
"Accha
(GOOD)" with big eyes...

378
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,310
When in wonder,
the tone is short...

379
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:20,330
"Your mother accident...
Really?"

380
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,846
When someone angry, the tone
sound even more high.

381
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,576
"Really? You want to teach me?
Really?"

382
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,115
When thinking, then
its long tone.

383
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:34,019
"Oh, that's it..."

384
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:38,003
You have to pay close attention.

385
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,146
Then one can understand
what they mean.

386
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,296
Because of so many confusion, I had
to learn it in full six hours.

387
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:47,672
Meaning you learned
all Bhojpuri language in just

388
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:50,104
six hours? -I can't touch
hands at that time.

389
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:54,470
Then I met one girl, I sit
together with her...

390
00:35:54,494 --> 00:35:56,977
I hold her hands and transfer
all the language she has to me.

391
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,342
Do you have a laughing brain?

392
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,746
There's a limit
to everything you know.

393
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,738
Is your hands
is like a USB cable?

394
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,992
That can transfer files
from computer to another computer?

395
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,998
And your clothes ...?

396
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:13,031
Your world's also wearing jeans?

397
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,261
No no no... Our world's don't
wear any clothes.

398
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:23,907
First time I got here, I think
that people's here different from each other.

399
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,396
Our world different
by the skin, the skin here...

400
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:32,871
Some have shining bright
skin, some have black skin.

401
00:36:34,037 --> 00:36:36,696
Some have coloured skin,
some have plain skin.

402
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:41,323
Some have a skinny skin
and some have hanging down skin.

403
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,949
Then one day I saw a car.

404
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,187
Dancing car.

405
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:59,408
Then I understood, that people's bodies
here is the same as my world.

406
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:03,378
The difference here
is that they all are wearing

407
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,805
something that fashion
over their body.

408
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:16,398
Now I can mix into the crowd.

409
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,969
But I don't know why all these
people are laughing at me.

410
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,478
After that, I understood
that men's clothes is

411
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,674
different and women's clothes
is different.

412
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:34,507
Day's clothes different
and night's clothes different.

413
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,038
Playing's clothes is different.
Eating's clothes is different.

414
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:44,307
Within my clothes I found
a kind of photo.

415
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:03,095
I slowly realize that this photo
is important to survive in this world.

416
00:38:03,587 --> 00:38:06,309
That if I give this photo,
I can get food to eat.

417
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,047
So I started to collect
pictures of this old man.

418
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,936
What man...

419
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,576
Why do you give me these ...?

420
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,797
This for bookstore, man...

421
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:45,954
Yes... right... here
is your carrots.

422
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:51,660
Now I realize that this picture
is useful in one paper only.

423
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,707
The other papers, the photo
is useful for nothing.

424
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:02,095
Now the need for money and clothes
I will always get from the dancing car.

425
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:05,412
It is my bank, and it
is also my tailor.

426
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:09,689
There's one time, I got
a strange clothes...

427
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,895
Where I don't need to show
any picture or photo...

428
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,982
And the food comes
to me on its own.

429
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,950
Mr. take this.

430
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,851
I realized that if I want
to find my remote

431
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:23,400
control I have to learn
this world language.

432
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:26,481
Without language, no
work can be done here.

433
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:33,735
Just like the man that I want to tell
that his style has some defect in my opinion.

434
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,097
I have a feeling
that I've damaged his fashion.

435
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:47,620
Here, let me correct it
just the way it was.

436
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,633
I met him down the road.

437
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,268
Some rascals hit
him and runaway.

438
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:24,784
The mind's not good.

439
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:28,133
He didn't respond anything.

440
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:31,077
Maybe he is deaf?

441
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:32,926
Oii...!

442
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,806
He hear. But give no answers.

443
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:40,286
It looks like a firm's hit
in the head.

444
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,234
Its memory lost.

445
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:44,202
Memory gone.

446
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,064
Do you remember who hits you?

447
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,730
Remember car plate number?

448
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,380
Remember anything?
Something?

449
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:35,975
Let's go brother.

450
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:38,324
Come with me.

451
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:43,395
As long as your memory don't come
back to you you will be my guests.

452
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,600
They say to cure memory lost...

453
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:50,774
Go to where your memory lost...

454
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:55,256
And you can get it back.
I've seen it in film.

455
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,764
What's he talking... It's important
to understand now...

456
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:01,661
I need to hold his hand
and transfer his language to me.

457
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,034
The name of the car is...

458
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:10,812
Memory gone, and now can't
differentiate man from woman?

459
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:12,257
Hold on a sec.

460
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:14,550
Look at my driver's license.

461
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:16,524
Gender.

462
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:18,842
Male. Man. Human.

463
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:20,762
Rascal, Bastard.

464
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,920
If I want to go
back to my home...

465
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:26,285
I definitely have
to catch someone's hand.

466
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:47,227
Mate, I met colorful friend.

467
00:42:50,464 --> 00:42:54,504
He is a strange man.

468
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:01,224
Mate, I met colorful friend.

469
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:04,811
He is a strange man.

470
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:08,223
You've been hard for us boy.

471
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:13,994
Do not do it... so...

472
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:18,573
The boy has truly
become my guest...

473
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:27,016
The boy has truly
become my guest...

474
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,764
I can understand
your pain, brother.

475
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:40,486
But don't openly hold hands.

476
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:45,175
Although it's a beautiful thing,
but it can be life threatening too.

477
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:50,889
You can wait no longer.

478
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,436
Come, come with me.

479
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:10,300
Here if you grasp anyone hands,
or legs, no one will kill you.

480
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:11,951
Come here, come on...

481
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:13,545
This is a good place.

482
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,918
Here they are very
nice and pretty.

483
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:20,758
Everyone inside was willing
to take my hand and take me home.

484
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,496
And then I've met a gentle girl...
Who has peace of mind.

485
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,007
Phuljaria.

486
00:47:26,765 --> 00:47:28,980
Phuljaria, take him
to the honeymoon room.

487
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:20,392
Phuljaria was sitting
there with Patience.

488
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,780
In the meantime, I...

489
00:48:21,804 --> 00:48:23,272
Over six hours...

490
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:25,788
Took her language into my body.

491
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,867
Pronunciation... X by J

492
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:31,525
I took everything
from her inside me.

493
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:43,761
First time, you useless...?

494
00:48:45,396 --> 00:48:47,156
It's first step
before the start, or what...?

495
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:53,717
Yes.

496
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,226
Where are you come from?

497
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:03,588
I came from very far away.

498
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:07,818
You have not even heard
the name of it.

499
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:10,238
But you talk like us.

500
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:12,508
It's you who teach me...

501
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:15,738
SO I speak exactly
like you, sister.

502
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:19,920
Hey, This sister will show you your mother!
Go, get out from here.

503
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,069
Brother...

504
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,894
Brother. Wake up.

505
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:27,782
Get up brother.

506
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:29,901
Brother.

507
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:33,139
You're talking, brother.

508
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:35,258
I want your help, brother.

509
00:49:35,282 --> 00:49:37,797
What magic did
Phuljaria do to you?

510
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:39,536
Come with me now.

511
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,425
This memory has a direct
connection to something.

512
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,449
This thing we must tell
the doctor, brother.

513
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,822
And you can be cured.

514
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:51,250
There is a very important job. Brother.
Please come with me, hurry.

515
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:01,510
Stop here. Stop here.

516
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,375
Brother...

517
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,676
That day, the chain
was taken from me here.

518
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:12,612
I want that chain, brother.

519
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,041
- Is it precious?
- Very much.

520
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:17,850
Listen brother.

521
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:21,230
The thief is from our village. But
the chain must have reach Delhi.

522
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:24,396
If you can trace where he sold
it, you can capture him.

523
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:28,816
So I have to go there, brother.
Where?

524
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:31,347
Delhi.

525
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,117
- Sir...
- What?

526
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:59,236
My remote control
has been stolen.

527
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:03,871
Are you drunk? Is finding
your remote TV a police job?

528
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:07,696
It's not a TV remote control.
Then what?

529
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,370
I cannot say that.

530
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:12,774
But it was fixed to a neck chain.
And it's worth much more.

531
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:15,901
Where did the theft happen?
At Mandawa.

532
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:18,663
It's stolen in Mandawa...

533
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,996
And you come to Delhi
to find it...?

534
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,956
But the thief must have
come to Delhi. So?

535
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:26,222
So where can I find the thief?

536
00:51:26,357 --> 00:51:28,598
Hey weirdo. There
are two million people in this city...

537
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:33,043
Policeman is human. Not God.

538
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:37,978
Only God can help you.

539
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:43,327
Hold God's two legs.
He's the only one able to help you.

540
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:48,469
Only God know. How can we know?

541
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,293
God know where, get out.

542
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,364
Have faith in the God, son.

543
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,315
Who is this Bhagwan?
That can help me.

544
00:52:01,648 --> 00:52:03,672
I see that everyone
mentioned his name.

545
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,989
After what I saw,
I was freaked out.

546
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,744
The people of this world...

547
00:52:09,768 --> 00:52:11,807
Made Them as pictures...

548
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:14,251
They themselves made a place
for Him in one place.

549
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:16,544
There are even streets
in His house.

550
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:19,614
Hundreds of thousands
of people go to Him.

551
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:23,130
He solve everyone's problems
for a small amount of charges.

552
00:52:23,606 --> 00:52:26,638
This kind of magic didn't
exist in my world.

553
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:31,257
I could not believe it. But I thought
I should try it once or twice.

554
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:35,971
Give me a God, brother.

555
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:39,875
Which one you want? This here is Rs.20...
50... 100... 500...

556
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,795
What's the difference
between Rs.20 and 500 ones?

557
00:52:44,017 --> 00:52:48,430
Only the size, everything else is the same.
The Rs.20's will work too, right?

558
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:53,223
Ok, Rs.15 then...

559
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,584
O God, I am very hungry.

560
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:10,806
Give me something to eat.

561
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,375
I've become totally
out of control.

562
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:27,097
This God is working.

563
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,311
Now I can go to my home.

564
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:32,501
God, someone took
my remote control.

565
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:34,969
Please bring it back,
I want to go home.

566
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,601
Sir, is this God out of battery?

567
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,244
I just used it once,
then it broke.

568
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:57,569
What do you mean...? -I mean,
put a new battery in him.

569
00:53:57,593 --> 00:54:00,767
It doesn't need any battery -Then
why this does not work...?

570
00:54:01,203 --> 00:54:04,537
Is it a defect one? No,
I made it perfect.

571
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,601
Is it you who created this God?

572
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,234
Yes, from my hands.

573
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:14,138
Did you created God
or did God created you?

574
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:16,900
God created us all.

575
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:19,154
But we make only His sculptures.

576
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:21,598
Why create his sculptures?

577
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,241
So that we can pray to Him.

578
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:25,495
Tell Him about our joys
and sorrows.

579
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:28,034
There's been installed
a communication device?

580
00:54:28,446 --> 00:54:30,558
How do we hear God say?

581
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:33,740
God does not need
any transmitter.

582
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:35,811
He hear directly.

583
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:38,692
If He hear directly, then
what's the need for sculpture?

584
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:41,811
What am I going to do
with this man...

585
00:54:42,818 --> 00:54:44,540
Trying to end our business, huh?

586
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:46,810
What is Your problem?

587
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:50,849
My remote control has been stolen.
I asked God...

588
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:52,960
To tell me where it is.

589
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:55,388
Are you Peekay (PK AS IN DRUNK)?
What does that mean?

590
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:58,593
Bro, this small God cannot do
something big like that...

591
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:01,339
He can't capture the thief,
the legs is short.

592
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:04,593
Go inside the temple.
There is a big God.

593
00:55:04,878 --> 00:55:07,409
Catch his feet.
He run very fast.

594
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:10,298
Give Him this nuts and some money to him.
Your job will be done.

595
00:55:10,624 --> 00:55:11,949
That will be Rs.200.

596
00:55:18,424 --> 00:55:20,835
Everyone was waiting for their turn
carrying nuts and money.

597
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,407
To make their work done.

598
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:25,542
Two hours later, it was my turn.

599
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:27,566
Oh God...

600
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:31,232
God. Give me back
my remote control.

601
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,716
B... Where is it?
Hurry, please.

602
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,628
Hold on, my remote
control's not received yet.

603
00:55:38,977 --> 00:55:43,413
Sir. He's not getting the job
done, I already gave money.

604
00:55:43,437 --> 00:55:45,571
You job will be done.
When will it be...?

605
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:47,975
Who can say when my son?
Your job will be done.

606
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,054
Move it. -But when
can I get my item?

607
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:55,593
Do not hold the queue, Go ahead.
What if someone else get my item?

608
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:58,553
Are you drunk? Hold on, ma'am.
What are you doing ...?

609
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:02,275
But where can I get my goods? -You
will find it in a mental hospital.

610
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:06,418
What? Paid money here,
and delivery at mental hospital?

611
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:09,132
Get this man out! Hey,
at least give me receipt.

612
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:12,965
Give me receipt so that I can ask
the man when can I get delivery?

613
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:17,735
Go on. Please go. But.
But my remote control.

614
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:28,702
I can't find my sandals.

615
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,321
Must be someone take it away.

616
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:32,315
Wear someone
else's sandals then.

617
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:34,440
That's what happen
at temples anyway.

618
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:52,858
Someone's take a full payment,
but never did the job.

619
00:56:57,278 --> 00:56:58,278
Say his name.

620
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,516
Bhagwan (GOD) - say
the full name.

621
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,380
Don't know his full name.

622
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,396
Where'd he live?

623
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,062
There, in front of the temple.

624
00:57:08,649 --> 00:57:10,435
You gave the money
to his own hand?

625
00:57:10,697 --> 00:57:12,332
No, I put it in a box.

626
00:57:12,356 --> 00:57:15,054
He said that your job will be done?
He does not speak.

627
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:17,466
- Why? He's mute?
- Maybe...

628
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:19,927
- Absolutely.
- Right...

629
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:23,363
Tell me his appearance.

630
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:28,417
He looks like this.

631
00:57:31,028 --> 00:57:32,266
Just the size is large.

632
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:35,750
Come here... Come here...

633
00:57:37,623 --> 00:57:39,503
Are you Peekay (PK AS IN DRUNK)?
(YOU'RE DRUNK?)

634
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:44,114
Err... Yes, but how do you all know that?
Am I blind?

635
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:49,503
20 years of police work. Just by seeing
I can tell who's drunk and who's not.

636
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,614
Mr. Singh, search him.

637
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:57,018
Give me his ID.

638
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:00,802
Dr. D'Mello.

639
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,953
Oh Dr. why did you drink so much
that you forgot your religion?

640
00:58:06,373 --> 00:58:10,342
You've mistaken
between temple and church.

641
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:12,889
You go to your church.

642
00:58:13,508 --> 00:58:15,341
To your own God.

643
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:18,317
Church...?

644
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:10,235
- Get out of here.
- But my item.

645
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:12,163
Beat it. Get out.

646
00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:15,707
Because of you, God
have been crossed.

647
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:18,869
What?
Nailed? God?

648
00:59:19,401 --> 00:59:22,131
- When?
- 2000 years ago.

649
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,686
For your sins.

650
00:59:24,368 --> 00:59:27,170
But what did I do?
I came here only just now.

651
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,106
Are you PK?

652
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:34,169
- Yup.
- God is watching you. He's looking at your behavior.

653
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:37,335
Where?
Where? Where is He?

654
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:40,525
- What's in that cup?
- Wine.

655
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:42,779
Wine...

656
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:45,707
At that time, I understand
just the thing...

657
00:59:46,342 --> 00:59:48,754
God have grown bored
with coconut water...

658
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:51,111
Now he's having fun with wine.

659
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:52,579
Now I will give wine.

660
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:55,309
So I started to collect money.

661
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,205
Some money I found
from the dancing car.

662
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,594
And some money,
from that gentleman.

663
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:04,459
Who stand at every bridge
everyday...

664
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:07,046
Who give me as much
money as I want.

665
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:31,955
Sir, is there any nearby God's house here?
Yes, just forward ahead.

666
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:53,649
Hold on.

667
01:00:54,744 --> 01:00:56,649
What's in your hand - Wine.

668
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:59,046
For God. Where is He?

669
01:01:40,252 --> 01:01:42,259
This madam looks very sad.

670
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:45,237
So I thought to know what happened,
I had to hold her hand.

671
01:01:46,084 --> 01:01:48,401
How dare you disturbed
a widow, asshole.

672
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:51,966
How do you know this
madam is a widow? You

673
01:01:51,978 --> 01:01:54,361
don't see she's wearing a white saree?
Asshole.

674
01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:07,660
Is everything fine?

675
01:02:12,502 --> 01:02:16,303
- I'm very sorry about the death of your husband.
- What? When?

676
01:02:16,826 --> 01:02:19,930
How do I know when? You're
wearing a white clothes.

677
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:24,700
I'm getting married that's why I wear it.
No, all people wear it for death.

678
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:27,597
They wear black for death, stupid.
Tell him. Get out of here.

679
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:42,149
Are all three of you
husband's dead?

680
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:44,760
Hey, I'm still alive!
You...!

681
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,307
After a lot of chasing
I came to understand...

682
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,243
That this world don't
have just one God.

683
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,925
But there are so many Gods.

684
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:54,385
And each of these Gods
have different rules.

685
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:57,282
And each Gods open
their own company...

686
01:02:57,726 --> 01:02:59,694
People have religion for them.

687
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,662
And each of these religion
have different manager.

688
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:06,424
In this world, everyone
have only one religion...

689
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:08,543
Meaning that they belong
only to one company.

690
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:13,273
And it's their company's God
which they worship, not of the others.

691
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:16,120
So, I'm a member
of which company then?

692
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,899
Which God should I pray to?

693
01:03:18,383 --> 01:03:21,430
If I want to know about my remote
control, knowing this is very crucial.

694
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:38,692
What are you doing?

695
01:03:39,176 --> 01:03:40,191
Where are the marks?

696
01:03:41,381 --> 01:03:42,396
What marks?

697
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,713
Religion's marks.

698
01:03:45,831 --> 01:03:47,879
How do I know which company
this kid belongs to?

699
01:03:48,998 --> 01:03:50,561
Where's the God's mark, brother?

700
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:53,219
Security!

701
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:03,003
It's getting hard to find
out my religion.

702
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:05,423
Now I can do just one thing

703
01:04:06,105 --> 01:04:08,296
I will worship every Gods
in every religion.

704
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:11,066
One of Them must
be the right One.

705
01:04:11,573 --> 01:04:12,843
And will hear to what I want.

706
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:27,865
O God...

707
01:04:27,984 --> 01:04:30,785
Where are you...?

708
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:37,467
Where are you... God...?

709
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:04,428
Where are you... God...?

710
01:07:10,316 --> 01:07:13,244
You have many names...

711
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:16,790
You have many faces...

712
01:07:17,353 --> 01:07:22,440
There's so many ways
to find you...

713
01:07:23,947 --> 01:07:26,772
I walked all the ways...

714
01:07:27,526 --> 01:07:30,137
But you could not be found...

715
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:35,922
I cannot understand
what you want...

716
01:07:37,644 --> 01:07:42,691
I cannot understand
what you want...

717
01:07:44,048 --> 01:07:50,000
I cannot understand
what you want...

718
01:08:28,082 --> 01:08:33,994
Where are you... God...?

719
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,773
I've had a mass confusion, God

720
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:50,081
I must have done
something wrong,

721
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,073
That makes you not heard me out.

722
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:55,882
Please tell me.

723
01:08:57,382 --> 01:08:58,652
Show me the way.

01:09:16,926 --> 01:09:18,490
I've speak

729
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:21,299

01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:22,648
Koran...

731
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:24,029
And verses of Bible.

732
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:27,513
Your different managers...

733
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,677

from the others...

734
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,797

735
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:34,706
Another says to sacrifices
on Tuesday...

736
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:37,757
One says to pray

737
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,161
Another says to pray
after the sunset.

738
01:09:41,153 --> 01:09:43,137
One says to worship cattle...

739
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:45,129
Another says to sacrifice it...

740
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:50,549
One says go to temples without any shoes,
another says go to church wearing boots.

741
01:09:51,905 --> 01:09:54,025
This... who's right
and who's wrong.

742
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:56,034
I do not understand anything.

743
01:09:58,906 --> 01:10:00,461
By mistake a came here...

744
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:04,889

756
01:11:45,507 --> 01:11:46,832
Shiva, destroyed the existing...

757
01:11:47,014 --> 01:11:48,641
Don't fear anything.

758
01:11:48,816 --> 01:11:50,538
Security!

759
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,522
Who are you? You
don't recognize me?

760
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:55,641
I'm PK.
(DRUNK)

761
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,646
Security.

762
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:03,339
Anyone out there? People come to drink
here. I hold a show in toilet?

763
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,378
Open the door.

764
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:09,346
First bring my remote control.

765
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:12,893
Which remote control?
My spaceship's remote control.

766
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:14,956
Spaceship?

767
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:17,956
Did you forget? How
many times I told you

768
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:21,322
I'm not from this world,
I came from faraway world.

769
01:12:21,577 --> 01:12:24,200
This way you. You find
my remote control, then

770
01:12:24,212 --> 01:12:26,622
I return to my home.
You understand, right?

771
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:28,209
Oh brother, leave me alone.

772
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:31,336
- I have small children.
- I know.

773
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:34,098
Your kids, They're not
so small anymore.

774
01:12:34,122 --> 01:12:38,344
They can live alone at home. You give me
my remote control and then go to your family.

775
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:40,732
Lord save me.

776
01:12:41,184 --> 01:12:43,009
Is there other God above you?

777
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:45,010
Where is He...?

778
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,089
Now presenting
the dance of Shiva.

779
01:12:50,732 --> 01:12:54,597
The Fearless - Help me!

780
01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:06,240
Help me...

781
01:13:07,914 --> 01:13:09,040
Help me!

782
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:54,788
I'm at Himalayas mountain...

783
01:13:55,772 --> 01:13:57,645
Remembering God.

784
01:13:58,645 --> 01:14:00,557
Suddenly there's a light.

785
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:03,795
Great light of nowhere.

786
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:10,056
The small light was raised
pointed down to earth.

787
01:14:10,961 --> 01:14:12,349
I looked at it.

788
01:14:13,055 --> 01:14:15,095
Remember that God is about.

789
01:14:15,547 --> 01:14:18,166
It quickly became a connection.

790
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,610
God. Pray to You...

791
01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:23,975
What is this light?

792
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:27,300
In the cold winter it
make me feel warm.

793
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:29,998
God said.

794
01:14:30,585 --> 01:14:35,672
This is from Shiva's. Take it...

795
01:14:36,323 --> 01:14:40,013
And built a shrine.

796
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,322
This is only appearance
devotees,

797
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:47,988
All that pain out of.

798
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,090
Do you want to see it?

799
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:57,106
Shiva's part of drum.

800
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:04,581
Bola Bola Bam Bam.

801
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:23,459
Bola Bola Bam Bam thanks God...

802
01:15:23,483 --> 01:15:27,357
Do not stop him, let him come.

803
01:15:27,381 --> 01:15:30,014
Come on, son, come on...

804
01:15:30,038 --> 01:15:32,649
Boy, not there. Come here.

805
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:37,442
Say what you want from here...

806
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:41,672
Bam Bam Bole. Thank God.

807
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:43,148
Where are you God?

808
01:15:43,528 --> 01:15:46,894
Come on, on stage.
I want to thank you Lord.

809
01:15:47,933 --> 01:15:49,322
He is here.

810
01:15:49,932 --> 01:15:54,012
I met Him in toilet.
I request for my property, but He ran.

811
01:15:54,828 --> 01:15:56,678
I thought He's running away...

812
01:15:56,797 --> 01:16:00,487
But no, he took me here.

813
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:03,082
To my property, thank
God, Thank God.

814
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:05,540
This is not a piece of Shiva.

815
01:16:05,564 --> 01:16:09,240
This one belongs to me. The
delivery mistakenly send it to you.

816
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,414
And your item may have
been send to someone else.

817
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:16,207
Just ask him. He's here. God
please come forward. Tell them.

818
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:21,594
Alright, I'll take
my property, ok?

819
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,926
Oh. It belongs to me.

820
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:36,307
Since when did you feel that you
came from another planet?

821
01:17:39,758 --> 01:17:40,758
Listen...

822
01:17:41,296 --> 01:17:45,662
You've to meet a psychiatrist,
mental doctor.

823
01:17:46,947 --> 01:17:47,947
Now go ma'am.

824
01:17:48,312 --> 01:17:50,752
- Rs.500 is able to give you so much punishment.
- Wait a minute.

825
01:17:57,963 --> 01:17:58,963
This is my card.

826
01:17:59,878 --> 01:18:01,942
There's my number...

827
01:18:02,163 --> 01:18:04,726
If you like, I can fix
you for an appointment.

828
01:18:05,202 --> 01:18:07,591
If you find time, call me, OK?

829
01:18:12,757 --> 01:18:13,844
Thank you Mr. Pandit.

830
01:18:16,478 --> 01:18:18,637
Do you think my story is a lie.

831
01:18:21,565 --> 01:18:24,485
Then go proceed
with your suicide dog on TV.

832
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:25,888
Nikku...

833
01:18:26,342 --> 01:18:28,128
That is your destiny.

834
01:18:35,705 --> 01:18:37,070
Mr. Pandit, Mr. Pandit...

835
01:18:37,094 --> 01:18:39,006
I want to go back
just two minutes.

836
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:43,085
What is going on these
going inside outside?

837
01:18:43,744 --> 01:18:48,275
Do this, give me another Rs.500,
and take this man with you.

838
01:18:48,656 --> 01:18:50,703
Nikku, The Suicide Dog...

839
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:53,417
When did I tell you about it?
You never did.

840
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,599
Then how do you know about it?

841
01:18:56,955 --> 01:18:58,440
When you hold my hand.
Then I know...

842
01:18:58,892 --> 01:19:01,661
You're doing a suicide
dog's story.

843
01:19:02,692 --> 01:19:06,104
You were thinking, if this story went awry.
Now Nikku is your destiny...

844
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:09,421
Do not lie. I must have told you about it.
Tell the truth.

845
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:13,437
I'm not capable of lying. Lie used mouth,
and I only use mind to communicate.

846
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:15,556
Our world can just
holding hands...

847
01:19:17,539 --> 01:19:19,062
- Give me your hand.
- No way.

848
01:19:19,086 --> 01:19:20,086
Give it!

849
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:23,102
Help me, son, my wife
is critical...

850
01:19:23,126 --> 01:19:26,714
Hospital has asked
for Rs.1000 to cure her.

851
01:19:27,452 --> 01:19:28,626
Only Rs. 500 is not enough...

852
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:32,324
If you can give Rs.500 son, my wife can...
I'll give it.

853
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:37,879
Here - If you give me your address,
I'll send money back.

854
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,926
Uncle, money order will not
reach my home, you keep it.

855
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,957
Thanks son.

856
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,750
Uncle...

857
01:19:45,559 --> 01:19:47,892
Take another Rs.100.
To give tip.

858
01:19:50,622 --> 01:19:52,122
Boy, God bless you.

859
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:55,947
You prove it already.

860
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:57,899
You cannot read anyone's mind.

861
01:19:58,264 --> 01:20:01,089
Don't you understand? That man
took the money by fooling you.

862
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:04,374
There is no hospital in this
neighborhood. I know.

863
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:07,644
He and his wife is taking
a meal at a five-star hotel.

864
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:09,929
Today, his wife's 75th birthday.

865
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:12,818
For 75 years he and his wife
never got to a five-star hotel.

866
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:15,826
He collected his pension
money little by little.

867
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:19,318
Then his wife ordered an ice cream,
the price had gone up a bit.

868
01:20:19,516 --> 01:20:22,032
Then he came here
to ask for money.

869
01:20:22,452 --> 01:20:23,579
Make up anything...?

870
01:20:25,095 --> 01:20:27,761
Madam, I told you
our world don't lie.

871
01:20:29,356 --> 01:20:30,364
The rest is up to you.

872
01:21:31,328 --> 01:21:33,733
Wait, wait, hold on.

873
01:21:34,137 --> 01:21:35,311
Give it with your hand.

874
01:21:36,295 --> 01:21:39,795
Today's your birthday,
give happy opportunity...

875
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,215
I told you no one lies
in our world.

876
01:22:42,318 --> 01:22:43,619
Have you told anyone...

877
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:54,807
Have you told anyone
that you an alien?

878
01:22:55,473 --> 01:22:57,418
If I said I will be put in lab.

879
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,878
They will cut me inside out.

880
01:23:01,877 --> 01:23:03,948
So why did you tell me?

881
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:09,416
Since I came here,
I only take people's money.

882
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:11,082
No one has given me money.

883
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:14,447
You're the first one given me by putting
in the box for charity in 5000.

884
01:23:15,486 --> 01:23:18,264
I've a feeling that you're
a gentleman, the one I can trust.

885
01:23:22,382 --> 01:23:24,049
I will find your remote
control, PK.

886
01:23:26,049 --> 01:23:27,049
How's that?

887
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,094
Now I don't know yet.

888
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:31,816
But you definitely will go
back to your house.

889
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:33,387
That's my promise.

890
01:24:21,588 --> 01:24:22,788
Why are you looking like that?

891
01:24:23,849 --> 01:24:24,849
At you.

892
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:27,583
It's not everyday alien
come to my house.

893
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:33,903
So... in your world, they hear
everyone out of the way, like you?

894
01:24:36,426 --> 01:24:40,156
The same. And
they all walks nude?

895
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:41,875
Don't you feel strange?

896
01:24:43,153 --> 01:24:44,513
See that bird, sitting
there nude...

897
01:24:45,374 --> 01:24:46,374
Is it feel strange?

898
01:24:47,176 --> 01:24:49,382
If it'd wear clothes,
then it looks strange.

899
01:24:52,357 --> 01:24:53,357
PK

900
01:24:54,008 --> 01:24:55,408
I did not sleep
all night yesterday.

901
01:24:56,277 --> 01:24:59,143
I was thinking how to get
your remote control.

902
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:04,317
Hello. Connect to Balbir
Singh, Room No. 4.

903
01:25:04,428 --> 01:25:05,428
Wrong number.

904
01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:07,801
Is this not a hospital?

905
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:10,786
Bro, you get a wrong number,
since yesterday I said that.

906
01:25:11,135 --> 01:25:14,762
How did I get the wrong number?
I have save the phone number personally.

907
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:17,730
Okay, so what did you thought?

908
01:25:22,015 --> 01:25:24,737
Hello. Connect to Balbir
Singh, Room No. 4.

909
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:27,721
Oh... you call late -why?

910
01:25:27,871 --> 01:25:30,956
Balbir Singh died this morning.
What do you mean ...?

911
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,815
But how did the surgery
hemorrhage can die?

912
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:37,522
It's unfortunate.
But don't worry.

913
01:25:37,681 --> 01:25:39,886
Let's write in death certificate
it's a heart attack.

914
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:41,909
So that family's reputation
will not be ashamed.

915
01:25:42,308 --> 01:25:44,529
So come on, OK, take the body.

916
01:25:44,632 --> 01:25:46,291
Ok - ok then bye.

917
01:25:49,314 --> 01:25:51,874
How can you say that?

918
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:54,410
It's nothing, Now he'll go to hospital.
Think about it.

919
01:25:54,422 --> 01:25:56,694
He'll see his friend is live
and how happy he will be.

920
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:01,939
He always call for wrong number, so
I'm having a little fun with him.

921
01:26:02,596 --> 01:26:05,906
- Fun ...?
- PK I was joking

922
01:26:15,388 --> 01:26:18,721
I understood. I saw the whole game.
They're kidding.

923
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:21,602
Mr. Tapaswi had called God...

924
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:24,610
He citing prayer and whatever...

925
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:27,078
But all his calls
is wrong number.

926
01:26:28,133 --> 01:26:30,538
A person who answered
his call is joking with him.

927
01:26:30,973 --> 01:26:34,941
Or else, how can he get
my remote control from Shiva?

928
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:37,845
It looks like...

929
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:43,059
Those who speak with God in this world have
a messed up telecommunications system.

930
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,257
Every call went
to the wrong number.

931
01:26:46,097 --> 01:26:48,137
What do you mean?
I always thought...

932
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:51,668
Why God did not
answer my problem.

933
01:26:52,414 --> 01:26:56,517
They say to scroll
down to get to him.

934
01:26:56,818 --> 01:26:58,850
Tell me. We are all children
of God, right?

935
01:26:59,358 --> 01:27:02,112
So which dad will tell
their children...

936
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:04,374
Scroll down to me
and everything will be done.

937
01:27:05,175 --> 01:27:07,292
Have your dad ever told you that?
"Child, scroll

938
01:27:07,304 --> 01:27:09,302
down to me if you want
to have a new outfit".

939
01:27:10,817 --> 01:27:15,087
And there's giving
away milk too...

940
01:27:15,976 --> 01:27:20,380
If the call go to the right
number, then what will God say?

941
01:27:21,085 --> 01:27:22,967
What will He say?

942
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:27,117
He'll say, every day millions of hungry
children are on the road sleeping in Delhi.

943
01:27:27,363 --> 01:27:30,506
Let them drink milk. Why
would I drink the milk?

944
01:27:30,982 --> 01:27:34,706
I'm sure there's someone joking with us.
Like what you did just now.

945
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,760
PK think that Tapaswi
is an honourable man.

946
01:27:38,062 --> 01:27:39,950
But I won't have him
confuse right now.

947
01:27:40,305 --> 01:27:43,115
Because in my head,
there's a nonsense idea.

948
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:46,273
An idea that can bring
back PK's remote control.

949
01:27:48,169 --> 01:27:51,630
- Who is this PK?
- Who? Where he come from? I know nothing of that.

950
01:27:52,097 --> 01:27:54,463
But he can see this world
unlike any of us see this world.

951
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:56,526
- What does that mean?
- Means...

952
01:27:57,049 --> 01:28:01,105
If he see you smoke, he'd call police
and tell someone's want to suicide.

953
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,843
Why? -Cause the cigarettes
packing has cancer picture.

954
01:28:06,843 --> 01:28:08,009
What do you think?

955
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:11,484
War.

956
01:28:12,301 --> 01:28:14,881
I would like PK to talk

957
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,826
I want him to talk
in a show on television.

958
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:20,864
Evaluate some values
in people's mind.

959
01:28:21,832 --> 01:28:24,268
Jaggu, there's already three marks
on my right side butt...

960
01:28:25,085 --> 01:28:27,925
Now you want the left side too so
that both sides are balanced, or what?

961
01:28:28,077 --> 01:28:32,355
No Jerry, it's important
to put PK.

962
01:28:32,657 --> 01:28:37,752
He will explain with love,
that everyone has call a wrong number.

963
01:28:38,204 --> 01:28:40,364
Tapaswi can not imagine
how he would deal with this PK.

964
01:28:41,505 --> 01:28:43,442
Jerry, Jerry.

965
01:28:44,164 --> 01:28:45,846
He's sitting out there.
See him once.

966
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:50,274
I challenge you, you cannot
answer his questions. Trust me.

967
01:29:01,612 --> 01:29:04,786
Sir, your cigarette fell just now.
Oh, thank you.

968
01:29:07,974 --> 01:29:10,641
This is not mine.

969
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:14,125
Kamasutra, Strawberry flavor.

970
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:21,633
I hate strawberries! Ask others...
It's not mine.

971
01:29:24,308 --> 01:29:26,387
Madam, is this yours?
How dare you?

972
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:30,061
- Just check your wallet. Maybe something's missing.
- Who are you? You rude.

973
01:29:31,782 --> 01:29:34,854
Uncle, this is yours, then?
No, it's not.

974
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:36,743
PK it is his.

975
01:29:37,068 --> 01:29:40,433
If you want to ask
anything, ask him.

976
01:29:42,075 --> 01:29:43,075
Come in.

977
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:46,797
What is this?

978
01:29:48,296 --> 01:29:49,336
Its condom.

979
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:53,479
What'd it do? To control
world population.

980
01:29:55,534 --> 01:29:58,343
- How's that?
- Have to wear it.

981
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:01,049
While having sex.

982
01:30:03,825 --> 01:30:06,713
You control world population
by wearing it? How?

983
01:30:06,913 --> 01:30:08,435
It's not me wearing it.

984
01:30:08,978 --> 01:30:12,014
Millions of people wear those things.
All of them get it from you?

985
01:30:12,903 --> 01:30:14,063
Everybody's got those things.

986
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:17,942
I have two questions. Just ask PK...
ask him.

987
01:30:18,815 --> 01:30:23,013
Why is that when people lost money
they all say "this is mine, this is mine".

988
01:30:23,203 --> 01:30:28,092
But when condoms is lost, everyone say
"this is not mine, this is not mine".

989
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,472
Here, sex is a private matter.

990
01:30:32,836 --> 01:30:35,654
How? -How can someone shout
that "today I will be having sex".

991
01:30:37,003 --> 01:30:38,439
But then at marriage party...

992
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:41,407
There's crackers,
orchestra, dance...

993
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:45,415
It looks like to tell everybody
in the city, "today I'm having sex."

994
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:49,978
Why? What?

995
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:53,112
I do not have an answer
to your question.

996
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:55,476
But I do have a job for you.

997
01:30:59,823 --> 01:31:01,783
Let's go, before this
guy change your mind.

998
01:31:05,186 --> 01:31:07,130
Watch you back now Mr. Tapaswi,

999
01:31:07,884 --> 01:31:09,019
Now it's my turn.

1000
01:31:13,789 --> 01:31:18,930
Mr. Tapaswi meet his followers here
everyday. They're talking about God.

1001
01:31:19,397 --> 01:31:22,215
We go in, listen
to his phone calls.

1002
01:31:22,509 --> 01:31:25,675
If you think that he is wrong,
then stop him immediately.

1003
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:28,937
Make him understand
that he is calling the wrong number.

1004
01:31:29,396 --> 01:31:30,856
If I do that, will he return
my remote control?

1005
01:31:31,054 --> 01:31:36,260
If he understand that what you say then
he will understand that chain is a joke...

1006
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:40,029
He'll return your remote control.
Yes, I'll make him understand.

1007
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,439
My wife has paralyzed
for six months...

1008
01:32:06,049 --> 01:32:09,851
Doctors not able to do anything.
I want...

1009
01:32:11,357 --> 01:32:12,358
O God...

1010
01:32:13,675 --> 01:32:15,159
Praise to you...

1011
01:32:22,165 --> 01:32:23,649
Yes...

1012
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:28,125
Do tell...

1013
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:35,710
Where?

1014
01:32:38,408 --> 01:32:39,408
God it's your choice.

1015
01:32:43,543 --> 01:32:46,843
- Have you heard Prathan...?
- No.

1016
01:32:47,955 --> 01:32:52,137
It's in Himalayas.
Go there by train...

1017
01:32:53,113 --> 01:32:54,557
From there, take a bus...

1018
01:32:55,112 --> 01:32:56,112
To GANGTOK...

1019
01:32:56,691 --> 01:32:58,770
Then to Padyathra
(BY WALK)...

1020
01:32:59,936 --> 01:33:03,935
Stay for 8 days and pray...

1021
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:06,205
At God's house.

1022
01:33:07,363 --> 01:33:09,909
Go with love. And
your job will be done.

1023
01:33:10,347 --> 01:33:12,958
Wrong number, this
is wrong number.

1024
01:33:13,593 --> 01:33:14,037
What is?

1025
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,522
Wrong number.

1026
01:33:15,712 --> 01:33:21,106
Tapaswi, you spoke to God with a messed
up telecommunication technology.

1027
01:33:21,653 --> 01:33:23,764
Every call you make
is wrong number...

1028
01:33:24,018 --> 01:33:27,803
The one answering is a duplicate one...
He's joking with you...

1029
01:33:27,938 --> 01:33:31,303
What are you trying to say?

1030
01:33:31,509 --> 01:33:33,946
I'll make you understand...
We all God's children, right?

1031
01:33:35,097 --> 01:33:39,954
Yes, so what? -So, what'd you tell
your sick child if they ask your help?

1032
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:42,936
Does you give him a cure?
Or tell him that...

1033
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:46,563
Go 4000 km from this house...
There's one more house there...

1034
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:51,674
Tell the one's in there
the same problem...

1035
01:33:52,722 --> 01:33:57,793
If he go to the real God, He
would say, Son, your wife is ill...

1036
01:33:58,324 --> 01:34:00,332
Go to someone else...
you're still alive...

1037
01:34:00,998 --> 01:34:03,848
If you're dead,
then come to me...

1038
01:34:04,189 --> 01:34:07,419
Now, you still alive aren't you?
Right?

1039
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:14,496
I can prove it, someone
took a joke for you.

1040
01:34:14,726 --> 01:34:17,908
Tapaswi, please
call God again...

1041
01:34:18,217 --> 01:34:20,820
Ask Him if He can give
some guarantee to this cure...

1042
01:34:21,098 --> 01:34:24,804
Uncle, before you got written
guarantee, do not leave here.

1043
01:34:25,351 --> 01:34:28,399
Call Him now, let's see here...

1044
01:34:29,304 --> 01:34:32,010
Tapaswi's lunch
time has arrived...

1045
01:34:46,413 --> 01:34:48,429
Tapaswi, that duplicate God...

1046
01:34:48,857 --> 01:34:51,372
Has given my item to you...

1047
01:34:55,854 --> 01:34:57,576
It's a fraud...

1048
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,226
Fraud. Fraud...

1049
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:04,710
Until now, man don't even see
God or heard from Him...

1050
01:35:05,488 --> 01:35:06,948
What God tells us to do...

1051
01:35:07,352 --> 01:35:09,003
Has been conveyed
by His managers only...

1052
01:35:09,654 --> 01:35:12,074
PK has presented an important issue.
What is?

1053
01:35:14,463 --> 01:35:17,771
Is these Manager's voice
has reached the true God?

1054
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:20,351
- No.
- He makes us understand that...

1055
01:35:20,779 --> 01:35:23,065
Is the calls made has
reached God, or a fraud?

1056
01:35:23,089 --> 01:35:27,160
- It's wrong numbers.
- So tell us PK, How can people react to this situation?

1057
01:35:27,184 --> 01:35:29,883
As long as the phone
line's not repaired...

1058
01:35:29,907 --> 01:35:33,771
Our problem will arise again and again...
We need to help each other.

1059
01:35:34,254 --> 01:35:39,072
PK tells important thing. As long as the Managers
can bring us to the right God...

1060
01:35:39,689 --> 01:35:44,309
We will not look to their aid.
We'll help each other.

1061
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:54,107
PK says not to build
this temple.

1062
01:35:54,131 --> 01:35:57,591
He told us that chain belongs to him.
What is in your pocket?

1063
01:36:00,766 --> 01:36:02,003
Do you smoke?

1064
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,288
- Yes.
- You do drink, right?

1065
01:36:07,088 --> 01:36:11,445
Yes, occasionally drink. You're a smoker.
Drink alcohol.

1066
01:36:11,469 --> 01:36:14,707
Knowing that both is poison.

1067
01:36:15,929 --> 01:36:17,794
The government gives permission.

1068
01:36:18,492 --> 01:36:20,762
Factory produced these poison.

1069
01:36:20,786 --> 01:36:26,270
The shops open sale these poison.
No one wants to question these.

1070
01:36:26,444 --> 01:36:31,610
But when I want to build in this
earth for the devotees of God...

1071
01:36:31,634 --> 01:36:36,451
Just want to build one temple...

1072
01:36:37,498 --> 01:36:39,172
Then why are these questions?

1073
01:36:40,306 --> 01:36:44,156
If you want to ask
question, go ask those...

1074
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:48,949
Who try to stop
building the temple.

1075
01:36:48,973 --> 01:36:52,084
Who is this PK?
He's not Pervez Khan.

1076
01:36:53,394 --> 01:36:55,179
Not even Pasha Kaman too...

1077
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,210
I ask you all...

1078
01:36:58,209 --> 01:37:02,646
If you want to ask, ask that PK.

1079
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:04,431
What's his religion?

1080
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:08,724
What's his religion, his sect?

1081
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,406
Long time ago there's someone
wanted to destroy a temple.

1082
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:17,033
Put our temples destroyed.

1083
01:37:18,105 --> 01:37:22,691
Today, someone else want
to do the same thing.

1084
01:37:22,975 --> 01:37:24,151
Yes, but...

1085
01:37:50,998 --> 01:37:55,132
Tapaswi, call your God now, you want
to know what's my religion, right?

1086
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,035
But first, ask Him what is His
children's religion...

1087
01:37:58,059 --> 01:38:02,471
What the hell are you doing here?
Cal Him, ask Him. Ask Him...

1088
01:38:02,495 --> 01:38:06,923
I don't have to call God for this.
Even I can answer this.

1089
01:38:07,391 --> 01:38:12,193
This is Hindu, Christian, this
is Sikh, this one of the Jains,

1090
01:38:13,057 --> 01:38:14,417
And this girl
is from your nation...

1091
01:38:15,935 --> 01:38:18,792
Guys, please tell Tapaswi
your names now...

1092
01:38:19,062 --> 01:38:22,252
Hello, my name
is Sukhwinder Singh...

1093
01:38:22,839 --> 01:38:26,014
Assalamu alaikum, I'm
Abbas Ali Yaqub...

1094
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:28,411
Hello, I'm Veer Jain.

1095
01:38:28,514 --> 01:38:30,585
Hi. I'm Christopher D. Souza.

1096
01:38:31,219 --> 01:38:34,561
I'm Jhaggat Jhandni Sahni.

1097
01:38:34,672 --> 01:38:36,910
Confused, right?

1098
01:38:37,236 --> 01:38:40,640
I have change
their appearance...

1099
01:38:41,131 --> 01:38:42,838
Religion's is always connect
to appearance, right?

1100
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,059
I'll show you. Come here...

1101
01:38:46,835 --> 01:38:49,399
With all this
appearance, a Sikh.

1102
01:38:50,018 --> 01:38:52,605
Take off the turban,
becomes a Hindu.

1103
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:56,367
Take off mustache,
then a Muslim.

1104
01:38:56,930 --> 01:38:59,644
This whole change was designed,
by that wrong number fake god.

1105
01:39:00,222 --> 01:39:03,969
If it's the right God, then it would be
marks on the body right? Show yours...

1106
01:39:05,048 --> 01:39:08,215
- Mine?
- Why turn back? Take off clothes, check it...

1107
01:39:09,572 --> 01:39:10,675
Why be shy?

1108
01:39:11,492 --> 01:39:15,579
Come on, removed all you clothes,
show your marks to Tapaswi...

1109
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:20,055
Why be shy? Ok, I too
will take my clothes off.

1110
01:39:23,094 --> 01:39:24,149
Look at this.

1111
01:39:26,983 --> 01:39:28,252
Any marked, huh?

1112
01:39:29,116 --> 01:39:31,688
Is there?
Nothing right?

1113
01:39:32,497 --> 01:39:34,950
Have any sign?

1114
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:38,799
And this too -Hey...
put this man out.

1115
01:39:39,394 --> 01:39:44,330
What is this, huh? I'm
going to prove it.

1116
01:39:48,908 --> 01:39:50,424
Goat cast eyes.

1117
01:39:58,916 --> 01:39:59,916
Jaggu.

1118
01:40:01,106 --> 01:40:03,757
Stop this program!

1119
01:40:06,312 --> 01:40:10,407
When you're 40 days born,
you got a name by Tapaswi.

1120
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:12,740
The one who gave you name...

1121
01:40:13,232 --> 01:40:14,652
Can take it out/back too...

1122
01:40:15,104 --> 01:40:17,216
Dad, he gave me name
Jhaggat Jhandni...

1123
01:40:17,763 --> 01:40:19,882
Who want that kind of name...
You!

1124
01:40:21,071 --> 01:40:22,659
How much money you want, huh?

1125
01:40:23,476 --> 01:40:26,127
You're doing all this
for money, right?

1126
01:40:26,476 --> 01:40:27,750
No.

1127
01:40:27,762 --> 01:40:31,619
You'll go to hell... Haven't
you any fear of God?

1128
01:40:37,269 --> 01:40:40,229
Thank you, Father. Thank you.

1129
01:40:40,767 --> 01:40:43,903
I give the idea but you
understand the rest of it...

1130
01:40:44,848 --> 01:40:48,887
This game is about fear. That wrong number
case did not just make fun out of us.

1131
01:40:49,212 --> 01:40:51,680
He's taking our fear and exploit it too.
Do you understand?

1132
01:40:52,717 --> 01:40:54,774
PK Can you make my father
understand too?

1133
01:40:55,075 --> 01:40:57,543
Yeah. I can. I can prove it too.

1134
01:40:57,567 --> 01:40:59,328
Let's go.

1135
01:41:00,113 --> 01:41:02,232
I don't have time to spend
for this nonsense.

1136
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:05,779
Dad, if this is nonsense,
I stop this program.

1137
01:41:19,522 --> 01:41:23,514
Father, This college is weird place.
Students here are all pretty scared.

1138
01:41:24,053 --> 01:41:27,942
Now I'm going to do business
about this fear. I'll show you.

1139
01:41:30,885 --> 01:41:31,885
Come.

1140
01:41:40,004 --> 01:41:42,083
This is the factory machine.

1141
01:41:48,137 --> 01:41:49,558
Invest some money.

1142
01:41:54,454 --> 01:41:57,049
And this is Unger...

1143
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:10,760
Now wait. 15 minutes
to double investments.

1144
01:42:17,783 --> 01:42:18,870
Look. Look.

1145
01:42:20,988 --> 01:42:22,354
He's trapped.

1146
01:42:23,486 --> 01:42:28,613
Hot hot tea. Look
there, man selling tea.

1147
01:42:28,756 --> 01:42:33,430
He's making expensive investment. Green
tea, sugar, thermos, water, glass,

1148
01:42:33,659 --> 01:42:36,644
And here it's just stone
and a little red...

1149
01:42:37,706 --> 01:42:39,190
Hot tea, hot tea.

1150
01:42:39,388 --> 01:42:41,333
He have to call
for customer there...

1151
01:42:42,078 --> 01:42:44,436
And here, by itself,
long customer queue.

1152
01:42:44,927 --> 01:42:48,879
Come on, hurry,
others want it too...

1153
01:42:51,784 --> 01:42:53,974
There, they bow
down to the customer.

1154
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:57,005
But here, the customer
bow down to it.

1155
01:42:59,124 --> 01:43:02,893
Look there. He has so much
fear, he plunged there.

1156
01:43:04,336 --> 01:43:08,439
That wrong number man is making a business.
Fear business...

1157
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:12,010
He knows that those who scared
will go to temples.

1158
01:43:12,843 --> 01:43:15,883
You're pretty scared too.
Remove these.

1159
01:43:17,141 --> 01:43:19,467
Don't ever question religion.

1160
01:43:20,173 --> 01:43:21,641
It's about faith and believe.

1161
01:43:22,546 --> 01:43:24,950
If God want us to not
raise questions...

1162
01:43:25,322 --> 01:43:29,259
They said that if we reason with him,
He'll never give his miracle.

1163
01:43:29,783 --> 01:43:33,187
These religion's man, if they can't
answer, then they will beat us.

1164
01:43:33,814 --> 01:43:35,807
People become afraid,
and shut their mouths.

1165
01:43:35,819 --> 01:43:37,512
But now, we will not
shut up anymore.

1166
01:43:38,099 --> 01:43:42,147
Until now PK only ask one question,
but now, he'll ask thousands of questions.

1167
01:43:43,163 --> 01:43:45,742
So guys, take up your phones.

1168
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:50,932
If you heard something wrong
number, record it on video.

1169
01:43:51,463 --> 01:43:53,424
We will broadcast
your recorded footages.

1170
01:43:54,201 --> 01:43:56,241
Pick up phones, and questions...

1171
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:07,531
Baba, Baba...

1172
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:11,816
One question Baba. If you can
make gold from your hand.

1173
01:44:12,133 --> 01:44:14,633
Why can't you end
the poverty in our country?

1174
01:44:15,069 --> 01:44:16,117
Answer please.

1175
01:44:17,553 --> 01:44:21,441
If you manage to make gold.

1176
01:44:21,465 --> 01:44:24,718
Why not aid us?
Answer.

1177
01:44:26,122 --> 01:44:28,789
Om... Om...

1178
01:44:28,813 --> 01:44:31,106
This is wrong number.
This is wrong number.

1179
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:32,852
Jaggu come with me.

1180
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:34,597
Come with me.

1181
01:44:34,882 --> 01:44:36,151
Just come.

1182
01:44:36,175 --> 01:44:38,405
I'm working. Come...

1183
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:40,788
Whole country send
us wrong numbers.

1184
01:44:41,288 --> 01:44:43,581
You did a terrific job.

1185
01:44:44,477 --> 01:44:45,978
Look now.

1186
01:44:50,816 --> 01:44:52,896
He says, if we give the bull
grass, we can get a job.

1187
01:44:53,617 --> 01:44:56,713
Should I include this cow in my bio data,
and go from a company to a company?

1188
01:44:56,919 --> 01:44:59,133
Or should I write
a monster.com bio data.

1189
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:01,999
This is wrong number. There is more.
There is more.

1190
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,124
He's saying become Christian,
or else I'll go to hell.

1191
01:45:05,433 --> 01:45:09,187
If God wants me to become Christian,
I would born in a Christian family.

1192
01:45:09,504 --> 01:45:12,218
Now why the need to switch religion.
This, wrong number.

1193
01:45:13,044 --> 01:45:14,845
Everybody here wants
to go to school.

1194
01:45:15,193 --> 01:45:18,178
But they said, if we go
to schools, they'll shoot us.

1195
01:45:18,718 --> 01:45:20,669
How can our God
be so low that...

1196
01:45:20,693 --> 01:45:24,899
If these children learned, He'll be angry?
This is wrong number.

1197
01:45:26,312 --> 01:45:29,319
That is what is written
in our book.

1198
01:45:29,994 --> 01:45:34,541
He have for the whole
universe, a master plan.

1199
01:45:34,565 --> 01:45:41,065
- You have to accept it.
- Outside the temple, you sale this book for Rs.10.

1200
01:45:41,089 --> 01:45:44,001
It's written in page four.
Read it...

1201
01:45:44,025 --> 01:45:45,526
"And I will have a son".

1202
01:45:45,962 --> 01:45:49,550
Meaning that, buy
and read a Rs10 book...

1203
01:45:49,574 --> 01:45:53,534
And you can destroy
that master plan...

1204
01:46:01,675 --> 01:46:05,588
PK Your program has been quite popular.
SMS around the world is coming.

1205
01:46:06,436 --> 01:46:07,523
Look, another one.

1206
01:46:12,672 --> 01:46:13,704
What happened?

1207
01:46:14,902 --> 01:46:16,142
Father send me a short message.

1208
01:46:16,647 --> 01:46:18,314
He's ashamed of his daughter.

1209
01:46:22,593 --> 01:46:23,632
You know?

1210
01:46:24,314 --> 01:46:25,394
I was ten years old when...

1211
01:46:26,331 --> 01:46:28,251
First time I write a poem.

1212
01:46:29,671 --> 01:46:30,782
For my father.

1213
01:46:32,647 --> 01:46:35,012
Everyone says I look
like my mother...

1214
01:46:35,838 --> 01:46:38,266
Everyone is right.

1215
01:46:39,044 --> 01:46:40,805
But I'm my father's daughter...

1216
01:46:42,344 --> 01:46:44,376
When I finished
recite my poem...

1217
01:46:45,447 --> 01:46:46,948
Everyone clapped...

1218
01:46:47,796 --> 01:46:51,852
But then, there's whistles
from far...

1219
01:46:53,058 --> 01:46:54,153
When the applause end...

1220
01:46:54,898 --> 01:46:57,040
That one whistle
and clap doesn't end...

1221
01:46:58,127 --> 01:46:59,253
It was my dad.

1222
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:01,923
He was so proud of me.

1223
01:47:03,634 --> 01:47:04,914
But the message he sent today...

1224
01:47:06,999 --> 01:47:08,101
Ashamed of you.

1225
01:47:08,878 --> 01:47:10,759
Your father's belief...

1226
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:14,044
And this thing happened...

1227
01:47:14,576 --> 01:47:16,456
We will show him these
wrong number...

1228
01:47:16,631 --> 01:47:20,083
Again and again until he come
to his sense...

1229
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:22,305
The day will never come PK.

1230
01:47:22,963 --> 01:47:25,686
Do not worry, get up.

1231
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:29,654
Get up, you know
what our world do when we sad?

1232
01:47:30,725 --> 01:47:33,027
- What is it PK?
- Do it with me.

1233
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:35,717
Batteries charge automatic.
What?

1234
01:47:36,248 --> 01:47:38,026
Copy me - PK.

1235
01:47:43,088 --> 01:47:44,390
What we are doing PK?

1236
01:47:51,426 --> 01:47:54,220
- Close your eyes.
- How can I copy you then?

1237
01:47:54,244 --> 01:47:55,966
Ok fine, open eyes...

1238
01:53:41,022 --> 01:53:43,426
Questions letter is more
than money in the money box...

1239
01:53:44,671 --> 01:53:48,727
Your pictures, books, medicines oil,
everything has stopped selling.

1240
01:53:50,004 --> 01:53:53,338
On Facebook and twitters also
millions of negative comments.

1241
01:53:55,669 --> 01:53:58,685
- Just this?
- This is the only one supported you.

1242
01:53:59,344 --> 01:54:00,637
The curses is in these ones.

1243
01:54:02,002 --> 01:54:03,105
Do something...

1244
01:54:03,946 --> 01:54:06,581
One more day and we can
be shut down...

1245
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:15,835
Phone that man...

1246
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,605
He got a lot of questions, huh?

1247
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:20,350
I'll ask him one question.

1248
01:54:20,802 --> 01:54:22,167
- Hey Jaggu.
- What?

1249
01:54:22,912 --> 01:54:23,912
What happened?

1250
01:54:24,841 --> 01:54:26,586
Tapaswi wants to be in our show.

1251
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,990
He wants to talk with PK.

1252
01:54:28,226 --> 01:54:31,133
That's awesome, PK will win.
It would be an amazing show.

1253
01:54:31,268 --> 01:54:33,879
You're prepare PK,
start advertising.

1254
01:54:40,225 --> 01:54:43,550
Do not forget...
"One more question"

1255
01:54:43,692 --> 01:54:45,677
6 o'clock Sunday afternoon.

1256
01:54:45,701 --> 01:54:50,232
Our boy has become a star.
Look, my bro's become a star.

1257
01:54:50,256 --> 01:54:53,581
He walked naked... naked...

1258
01:54:54,263 --> 01:54:56,493
I made him a star.

1259
01:54:57,271 --> 01:55:00,596
He sit in TV. And me?

1260
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:06,246
What am I doing in this village.
I should be in there drinking with them...

1261
01:55:06,436 --> 01:55:10,086
A big star...

1262
01:55:10,832 --> 01:55:12,181
Became a star... heh...

1263
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:31,416
PK, some Dheeru Singh
wants to speak.

1264
01:55:32,106 --> 01:55:34,106
- Brother...?
- Take that line...

1265
01:55:36,335 --> 01:55:38,922
- Brother.
- Oh, boy.

1266
01:55:38,946 --> 01:55:41,088
So... you became a star now?

1267
01:55:41,929 --> 01:55:45,032
- Where are you brother?
- Right now I'm in Mandawa.

1268
01:55:45,214 --> 01:55:49,770
I will come to you tomorrow.
And bring a present for you.

1269
01:55:50,571 --> 01:55:54,357
The one stole your item,
is here with me.

1270
01:55:54,761 --> 01:55:57,920
He sold your item at 40,000.

1271
01:55:58,531 --> 01:56:00,507
- Ask me to whom?
- To whom?

1272
01:56:01,094 --> 01:56:03,538
Tapaswi...

1273
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,908
God said...

1274
01:56:08,313 --> 01:56:13,138
Shiva's drum broke down.
Take it...

1275
01:56:14,328 --> 01:56:17,423
Take it and built a shrine.

1276
01:56:17,447 --> 01:56:20,994
Because this is appearance...

1277
01:56:22,525 --> 01:56:23,978
Hello. What happened?

1278
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,978
The one stole my remote...

1279
01:56:27,708 --> 01:56:29,660
- That thief got caught.
- What?

1280
01:56:30,088 --> 01:56:31,922
- Really?
- Brother said...

1281
01:56:33,159 --> 01:56:36,301
The thief sold he remote
to Tapaswi...

1282
01:56:36,467 --> 01:56:37,856
Then it's game
over for Tapaswi...

1283
01:56:38,816 --> 01:56:40,006
Take him home...

1284
01:56:40,474 --> 01:56:42,338
And tell Tapaswi to give
you that remote

1285
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:44,410
control... Or else we show
this thief on TV...

1286
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:48,600
Tapaswi got my remote control
on Himalaya's mountain...

1287
01:56:49,234 --> 01:56:51,122
This mean that Tapaswi a liar...

1288
01:56:52,485 --> 01:56:53,486
That means...

1289
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:56,327
It's not a wrong number
duplicate God...

1290
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:58,616
It's Tapaswi who got
it first hand...

1291
01:57:01,787 --> 01:57:04,009
Jaggu do you know of this?

1292
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:07,263
Remember when you first told
me about the wrong numbers?

1293
01:57:07,287 --> 01:57:09,731
Tapaswi who calls God...

1294
01:57:09,755 --> 01:57:11,755
They all are wrong number.

1295
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:14,874
I immediately realized
that you're misunderstanding.

1296
01:57:15,247 --> 01:57:18,047
But I did not explain your mess.
Because if you told that.

1297
01:57:18,059 --> 01:57:20,628
Tapaswi a liar, everybody
would have laughed at you.

1298
01:57:21,032 --> 01:57:23,343
People want something
new every day, PK.

1299
01:57:23,367 --> 01:57:25,183
This wrong number
you told people...

1300
01:57:25,207 --> 01:57:28,064
They are deeply touched
by its uniqueness.

1301
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:31,032
Today they're with you PK.
This is the wrong number.

1302
01:57:31,056 --> 01:57:34,492
My plan worked, PK. Understand
that you got your remote control.

1303
01:57:40,237 --> 01:57:41,253
Friend...

1304
01:57:42,142 --> 01:57:43,610
You'll go to your home
tomorrow...

1305
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:46,808
Gone...

1306
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:49,863
We'll never meet again...

1307
01:57:52,808 --> 01:57:55,022
I'll feel lonely, friend...

1308
01:57:57,093 --> 01:57:58,982
I'll really miss you.

1309
01:58:01,838 --> 01:58:03,118
Will you stop me?
(FROM GOING)...

1310
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:08,456
How can I stop you?

1311
01:58:09,987 --> 01:58:10,995
I'm serious.

1312
01:58:11,836 --> 01:58:15,376
I can work. I'll correct
everything.

1313
01:58:15,654 --> 01:58:16,733
I can settle down here...

1314
01:58:17,391 --> 01:58:21,495
You can find someone for me who can
spend time with me. Right?

1315
01:58:22,241 --> 01:58:23,947
I will marry her. Or what?

1316
01:58:24,907 --> 01:58:26,439
Who can marry you?

1317
01:58:27,264 --> 01:58:28,629
Why is that?

1318
01:58:29,216 --> 01:58:31,756
Your wife will be in trouble
to introduce you.

1319
01:58:33,161 --> 01:58:35,153
Meet my husband.

1320
01:58:35,305 --> 01:58:36,764
His name is PK
(DRUNK)

1321
01:58:37,985 --> 01:58:41,137
That's not my name. Everyone
call me that, nonsense.

1322
01:58:41,161 --> 01:58:43,454
- PK (DRUNK)
- I'll change my name.

1323
01:58:45,176 --> 01:58:47,430
Would you...

1324
01:58:47,715 --> 01:58:49,438
suggest my new name?

1325
01:58:50,255 --> 01:58:52,366
- Whatever name you like.
- Look.

1326
01:58:52,937 --> 01:58:55,580
The person's name
and his personality...

1327
01:58:56,127 --> 01:58:58,754
Have to be match.
Yes, you're right.

1328
01:58:59,444 --> 01:59:03,357
So... how is my personality?
Let me show a demo...

1329
01:59:04,793 --> 01:59:06,849
Kaka seriously said...

1330
01:59:09,348 --> 01:59:12,308
The difference
between name and face...

1331
01:59:12,332 --> 01:59:15,363
I do not want to hear poetry.
Say something else.

1332
01:59:16,307 --> 01:59:18,870
The name and image,
the difference...

1333
01:59:18,894 --> 01:59:22,100
Damn. How to make
her understand?

1334
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:24,243
Get another name...

1335
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:26,369
Get another face...

1336
01:59:27,043 --> 01:59:30,519
Fire has completely cooled...

1337
01:59:56,563 --> 02:00:00,539
That's very good... Here I have so
many cards and different names...

1338
02:00:01,515 --> 02:00:04,626
You choose any name. Look
inside and choose one you like...

1339
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:07,602
Tandu Ram...

1340
02:00:08,848 --> 02:00:10,308
Another...

1341
02:00:11,427 --> 02:00:14,149
Tuttari Singh.

1342
02:00:16,236 --> 02:00:17,601
Sarfaraaz...

1343
02:00:24,076 --> 02:00:26,941
What happened? There
are more inside...

1344
02:00:31,407 --> 02:00:32,462
Jaggu What happened?

1345
02:00:33,763 --> 02:00:34,763
Nothing.

1346
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:44,929
Hey brother...

1347
02:03:41,844 --> 02:03:45,082
One terrorist organization has claimed
responsibility for the attack.

1348
02:03:45,955 --> 02:03:49,304
They say this
is only one small example.

1349
02:03:49,708 --> 02:03:52,597
This is what happens
to those who attacked us.

1350
02:03:52,621 --> 02:03:55,343
We will defend our God.

1351
02:04:16,929 --> 02:04:17,938
Where are you going, PK?

1352
02:04:19,906 --> 02:04:23,159
The show. No, you
don't need to go.

1353
02:04:25,929 --> 02:04:26,929
It's important to go.

1354
02:04:42,844 --> 02:04:44,486
"One more question."

1355
02:04:44,866 --> 02:04:48,113
In this special program,
for all of you...

1356
02:04:48,232 --> 02:04:50,787
Where we bring together PK and...
Hold on...

1357
02:04:50,978 --> 02:04:52,358
Wait a bit.

1358
02:04:57,785 --> 02:04:58,785
Give me...

1359
02:05:05,284 --> 02:05:06,315
What is this thing?

1360
02:05:07,346 --> 02:05:08,704
God said that...

1361
02:05:09,394 --> 02:05:11,569
This is His broke down's drum...

1362
02:05:12,283 --> 02:05:13,339
But he said...

1363
02:05:14,124 --> 02:05:15,148
It belongs to him.

1364
02:05:16,632 --> 02:05:18,219
God said...

1365
02:05:19,013 --> 02:05:20,131
Build a temple.

1366
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:21,956
And he said...

1367
02:05:22,844 --> 02:05:25,297
Don't make temple...
Who should we listen?

1368
02:05:26,646 --> 02:05:27,670
Is it God?

1369
02:05:28,542 --> 02:05:29,566
Or. This guy?

1370
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:34,072
Wearing a yellow helmet,
and gave these out.

1371
02:05:34,936 --> 02:05:35,936
See this... look here...

1372
02:05:37,356 --> 02:05:38,380
First he said...

1373
02:05:39,316 --> 02:05:40,657
God is missing...

1374
02:05:41,125 --> 02:05:42,760
Then he called God a fraud...

1375
02:05:43,347 --> 02:05:44,664
Tomorrow he might say...

1376
02:05:45,291 --> 02:05:46,394
That God has died.

1377
02:05:48,592 --> 02:05:50,164
Boy, what do you want?

1378
02:05:50,973 --> 02:05:54,188
A world which doesn't have God?

1379
02:05:56,076 --> 02:05:58,676
Are you... so desperate...

1380
02:05:58,695 --> 02:06:00,234
To hurt people's feelings?

1381
02:06:01,185 --> 02:06:03,488
Some people do not
have bread to eat.

1382
02:06:04,065 --> 02:06:05,700
Some don't have roof to stay...

1383
02:06:06,929 --> 02:06:09,470
Those people don't even have
friend to talk to...

1384
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:13,547
Everyday how many people kill
themselves, do you know?

1385
02:06:14,063 --> 02:06:18,451
Wrists cut, hang neck on fan...
why?

1386
02:06:18,823 --> 02:06:21,054
Because they do not have hope...

1387
02:06:21,633 --> 02:06:23,625
If God come forward...

1388
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:25,847
Put tikka in forehead...

1389
02:06:26,894 --> 02:06:29,442
Put some thread
around their hand...

1390
02:06:29,466 --> 02:06:32,345
Giving them some hope to live...

1391
02:06:32,369 --> 02:06:36,870
So who are you to deny
this hope from them?

1392
02:06:37,322 --> 02:06:38,322
And if you...

1393
02:06:38,893 --> 02:06:42,036
Really want to snatch God
from those people's lives...

1394
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:45,377
Tell me, what do you want
to give them instead?

1395
02:06:46,266 --> 02:06:49,670
You always said these wrong number.
Wrong number. Right?

1396
02:06:50,662 --> 02:06:55,074
So tell everyone here now,
what is the correct number...?

1397
02:07:04,422 --> 02:07:06,471
You're exactly right Tapaswi...

1398
02:07:08,225 --> 02:07:10,331
There's one time, when...

1399
02:07:10,462 --> 02:07:13,161
I too, could not
find food to eat.

1400
02:07:14,375 --> 02:07:15,716
I don't have home to stay.

1401
02:07:16,794 --> 02:07:18,049
I cried a lot.

1402
02:07:19,422 --> 02:07:21,231
I don't even have friends.

1403
02:07:23,254 --> 02:07:26,048
I only had one thing...

1404
02:07:28,927 --> 02:07:30,006
God...

1405
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:34,180
Everyday I thought
tomorrow will be better...

1406
02:07:35,283 --> 02:07:36,830
God will show me some way out...

1407
02:07:39,646 --> 02:07:40,663
I agree...

1408
02:07:41,972 --> 02:07:44,417
That putting faith in God...

1409
02:07:45,028 --> 02:07:46,393
One can find hope...

1410
02:07:48,115 --> 02:07:51,535
The difficulties will go away... courage
will come. Will get strength...

1411
02:07:53,328 --> 02:07:54,820
But I have one question.

1412
02:07:58,684 --> 02:08:00,437
Which God should I believe in?

1413
02:08:02,532 --> 02:08:04,992
You all say that,
it's only one God.

1414
02:08:06,865 --> 02:08:07,968
I say, no...

1415
02:08:09,721 --> 02:08:10,721
There are two Gods...

1416
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,340
One is the one who created
us all.

1417
02:08:16,657 --> 02:08:19,450
The other one is the one created
by people like you.

1418
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:24,434
We know nothing about the God
who made us all.

1419
02:08:25,132 --> 02:08:26,759
But the God people
like you made...

1420
02:08:27,211 --> 02:08:29,092
Is exactly like you...

1421
02:08:30,163 --> 02:08:32,258
Liar. Pretend to act...

1422
02:08:32,901 --> 02:08:34,083
Giving false promises.

1423
02:08:34,885 --> 02:08:36,416
Meeting rich people sooner...

1424
02:08:37,415 --> 02:08:38,851
Letting the poor neglected...

1425
02:08:39,256 --> 02:08:40,478
Happy when get praised...

1426
02:08:41,176 --> 02:08:42,536
People are afraid
to even say word.

1427
02:08:44,533 --> 02:08:46,454
My right number is very simple.

1428
02:08:48,334 --> 02:08:51,128
The God who created us all...

1429
02:08:51,818 --> 02:08:53,001
Put faith in Him...

1430
02:08:54,683 --> 02:08:57,612
And the God people like you created...
The duplicate god...

1431
02:08:58,905 --> 02:08:59,913
Destroy it...

1432
02:09:03,301 --> 02:09:08,548
You talking about our God
and you'd think I will sit idle?

1433
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:11,697
Boy, we will protect our God.

1434
02:09:11,721 --> 02:09:13,871
You can protect God ...?

1435
02:09:14,283 --> 02:09:15,347
You ...?

1436
02:09:16,665 --> 02:09:18,418
This world is very small...

1437
02:09:19,005 --> 02:09:21,648
This world is very small
compared to the whole universe.

1438
02:09:22,045 --> 02:09:26,433
And you... by sitting in this little world,
this little place, this little street...

1439
02:09:27,123 --> 02:09:30,020
Saying that you want to protect the God
who created all these universes?

1440
02:09:31,773 --> 02:09:33,209
He doesn't need
your protection...

1441
02:09:34,804 --> 02:09:36,717
He can protect Himself...

1442
02:09:40,303 --> 02:09:44,541
Today, one of my friends
died trying to help me...

1443
02:09:46,485 --> 02:09:48,271
I was left only his shoe.

1444
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:52,398
Stop trying to defend God.

1445
02:09:52,811 --> 02:09:53,945
Or else in this world...

1446
02:09:54,501 --> 02:09:56,342
People will not
only leaving shoes.

1447
02:09:56,453 --> 02:09:58,318
One Muslim blasted bomb...

1448
02:09:59,763 --> 02:10:01,024
And one Hindu Guru...

1449
02:10:01,548 --> 02:10:04,048
Sitting here listening
to your speech.

1450
02:10:05,413 --> 02:10:07,397
Who's Hindu and who's Muslim...

1451
02:10:08,127 --> 02:10:09,992
Where are the marks...
show me...

1452
02:10:11,690 --> 02:10:14,142
This difference created
by you people, not God...

1453
02:10:14,872 --> 02:10:15,919
And this...

1454
02:10:16,291 --> 02:10:18,855
This world's dangerous
wrong number...

1455
02:10:19,299 --> 02:10:20,735
Is the most dangerous
wrong number...

1456
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:23,790
Where people dies.
Torn each other apart.

1457
02:10:24,242 --> 02:10:25,678
This kind of wrong
number, you...

1458
02:10:25,948 --> 02:10:28,694
Lied to Jaggu's parent...
and separate her from Sarfaraaz...

1459
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:32,368
What wrong number? -That
Sarfaraz will lie to her...

1460
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:34,717
That Muslims are hypocrites,
who said that...?

1461
02:10:34,876 --> 02:10:36,883
So... he did deceived her.

1462
02:10:37,049 --> 02:10:38,997
It's not a lie.

1463
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,558
Hold on. What is this ...?

1464
02:10:40,582 --> 02:10:43,010
- Look.
- You wait.

1465
02:10:44,732 --> 02:10:46,335
You're saying that...

1466
02:10:47,192 --> 02:10:49,414
The prophecy I said
about Sarfaraaz...

1467
02:10:50,676 --> 02:10:51,676
Is a lie?

1468
02:10:52,501 --> 02:10:54,295
Yes, that's what I said.

1469
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:57,588
So prove it. Prove it
that my prophecy is a lie...

1470
02:10:57,897 --> 02:10:59,707
If you cannot prove it...

1471
02:11:00,072 --> 02:11:02,508
You've to touch my feet
and apologize...

1472
02:11:02,532 --> 02:11:06,397
And you must admit in front of everybody,
that you have launch a lie to me...

1473
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:10,770
And if I can prove it?
Don't PK.

1474
02:11:17,238 --> 02:11:18,974
That, my son, is yours.

1475
02:11:24,982 --> 02:11:26,244
Conditions agreed...

1476
02:11:27,046 --> 02:11:31,498
Please focus the camera
on Jhagat Jhananni.

1477
02:11:37,877 --> 02:11:39,925
Jhaggat Jhandni... I hope that,

1478
02:11:40,687 --> 02:11:44,162
You would honestly
answer my questions.

1479
02:11:47,003 --> 02:11:51,741
In Belgium, you've been in love
with a Pakistani boy.

1480
02:11:53,485 --> 02:11:54,597
True? Or false?

1481
02:11:55,129 --> 02:11:57,406
Why would we discuss
about my personal life?

1482
02:11:57,430 --> 02:11:58,866
On Friday...

1483
02:11:59,921 --> 02:12:03,801
I told one of my prophecies
that...

1484
02:12:04,309 --> 02:12:05,888
This boy will betray you...

1485
02:12:06,491 --> 02:12:07,499
The next day,

1486
02:12:08,411 --> 02:12:10,721
You went to marriage
registrar office...

1487
02:12:11,379 --> 02:12:12,665
But the boy did not come.

1488
02:12:13,522 --> 02:12:14,522
True or false?

1489
02:12:15,315 --> 02:12:18,403
Yes, he didn't come, can
you please stop this?

1490
02:12:21,124 --> 02:12:22,124
Now...

1491
02:12:22,830 --> 02:12:26,695
You'll come to my feet?
Or I bring my feet to you...?

1492
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:28,822
Sarfaraz did not betray you.

1493
02:12:29,313 --> 02:12:33,385
Let it go, PK. Please. No, tell
everyone what happened that day.

1494
02:12:34,194 --> 02:12:36,662
- Please PK.
- Only once.

1495
02:12:37,875 --> 02:12:38,932
For me.

1496
02:12:44,964 --> 02:12:47,082
I was in the marriage
registrar office...

1497
02:12:48,947 --> 02:12:51,756
I got a letter... Sarfaraaz
came to gave that letter?

1498
02:12:53,811 --> 02:12:54,811
No.

1499
02:12:56,668 --> 02:12:59,247
One little boy sent me that. -His
name written in that letter?

1500
02:13:00,334 --> 02:13:01,334
No.

1501
02:13:01,715 --> 02:13:03,945
Then how do you know
that Sarfaraz sent it?

1502
02:13:08,268 --> 02:13:09,268
It can be that...

1503
02:13:09,878 --> 02:13:11,158
That letter is for another girl?

1504
02:13:15,297 --> 02:13:16,822
There were no other girls there?

1505
02:13:17,449 --> 02:13:19,663
There's one right?
Who'd carried a cat?

1506
02:13:21,406 --> 02:13:24,851
She'd gave you that cat
to hold, right?

1507
02:13:26,501 --> 02:13:29,374
Did you recognize the boy
who sent you that letter?

1508
02:13:31,056 --> 02:13:32,508
- No.
- Did he recognized you?

1509
02:13:34,127 --> 02:13:36,151
- No.
- So how did he know...

1510
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:37,968
To give you that letter?

1511
02:13:38,976 --> 02:13:41,636
Could it be that he forgot...

1512
02:13:42,267 --> 02:13:43,863
And gave that letter...

1513
02:13:44,601 --> 02:13:45,601
To anyone there?

1514
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:49,727
He gave you that letter.

1515
02:13:50,409 --> 02:13:51,409
You read it.

1516
02:13:52,337 --> 02:13:54,028
Then you did not
call Sarfaraz...

1517
02:13:55,607 --> 02:13:57,247
Why would you assume
all this of Sarfaraz?

1518
02:13:58,757 --> 02:14:00,074
Because this Tapaswi...

1519
02:14:00,495 --> 02:14:02,478
Had given you
the wrong number...

1520
02:14:03,152 --> 02:14:05,208
That Muslims are all deceivers.

1521
02:14:06,248 --> 02:14:08,279
Sarfaraz didn't
deceived you, Jaggu.

1522
02:14:08,541 --> 02:14:10,104
What's going on here?

1523
02:14:10,126 --> 02:14:13,540
This cats and dogs.
I mean, you can tell any story...

1524
02:14:13,564 --> 02:14:15,684
And I'll just sit here listening
to whatever you talk?

1525
02:14:15,872 --> 02:14:18,436
Hold on. We'll know
the truth in this show...

1526
02:14:18,448 --> 02:14:20,853
Jaggu take out your phone.
Call Sarfaraz.

1527
02:14:21,148 --> 02:14:22,886
Jaggu Hurry,

1528
02:14:25,695 --> 02:14:29,195
"This number did not exist."

1529
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:32,877
Another number? Friend,
college, something.

1530
02:14:33,551 --> 02:14:34,766
Come on Jaggu.

1531
02:14:34,790 --> 02:14:36,321

1532
02:14:41,225 --> 02:14:42,614
Hello.

1533
02:14:42,828 --> 02:14:46,757
Hello, I need to get in touch
with one of your grads student?

1534
02:14:47,685 --> 02:14:51,058

Has he left a number? Sorry, We're

Have a nice day dear.

Pakistan's number?
His home number? No.

1541
02:15:05,351 --> 02:15:07,104
Think, Jaggu think.

1542
02:15:09,072 --> 02:15:11,842
I have a part time job
at Pakistan Embassy.

1543
02:15:12,088 --> 02:15:14,254
He has a part time job
at Pakistan Embassy.

1544
02:15:15,404 --> 02:15:18,396
Nitu, call the Pakistan
Embassy, Belgium...

1545
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:20,015
And put it on loudspeaker.

1546
02:15:23,402 --> 02:15:25,378
Salam... Pakistan Embassy.

1547
02:15:26,164 --> 02:15:27,600
Hello.

1548
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:32,100
Is there a student
from Lahore working there?

1549
02:15:32,933 --> 02:15:35,354
Sarfaraz Yusuf?
Is your name Jaggu?

1550
02:15:39,042 --> 02:15:41,168
Hello, is your name Jaggu?

1551
02:15:41,842 --> 02:15:43,096
Yes, how do you know?

1552
02:15:43,850 --> 02:15:45,715
That call came.

1553
02:15:45,739 --> 02:15:49,492
That Delhi girl's call came.
Jaggu's call came.

1554
02:15:49,516 --> 02:15:52,420
Come on everyone.
Jaggu's call came.

1555
02:15:52,444 --> 02:15:55,912
India's call came, hurry come...

1556
02:15:58,673 --> 02:15:59,705
Ma'am,

1557
02:16:00,006 --> 02:16:04,594
Sarfaraz Yusuf call us
everyday, 9a.m, from Lahore.

1558
02:16:05,316 --> 02:16:09,308
And in all his call,
he asked only one thing...

1559
02:16:09,816 --> 02:16:13,212
Is there any call from India,
Jaggu's call for me?

1560
02:16:14,791 --> 02:16:17,831
We told him no, and he called
off the phone.

1561
02:16:18,212 --> 02:16:19,569
He make everyone crazy.

1562
02:16:20,299 --> 02:16:22,600
You hang in there,
I'll contact him.

1563
02:16:38,202 --> 02:16:39,202
Hello.

1564
02:16:40,329 --> 02:16:43,503
- Sarfaraz Yusuf?
- Yes, Salam...

1565
02:16:43,955 --> 02:16:45,312
From where are you talking?

1566
02:16:45,716 --> 02:16:47,835
From Lahore, why?

1567
02:16:48,168 --> 02:16:50,088
From where are you talking
right about this time?

1568
02:16:50,382 --> 02:16:53,112
I'm in my house, why?

1569
02:16:53,707 --> 02:16:57,350
Are there any chairs around you?

1570
02:16:57,794 --> 02:17:02,429
If there is, please sit down. You're
going to drop hearing this...

1571
02:17:03,421 --> 02:17:05,524
Oh sorry. I don't
understand what you said.

1572
02:17:06,889 --> 02:17:08,651
There's a call
from Delhi for you.

1573
02:17:15,386 --> 02:17:17,268
Now talk to her...

1574
02:17:19,974 --> 02:17:22,315
- Hello.
- Sarfaraz...

1575
02:17:27,391 --> 02:17:28,391
Jaggu...

1576
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:31,993
Hello.

1577
02:17:34,183 --> 02:17:35,850
Hello, you're not Jaggu?

1578
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:42,000
- You did came to the marriage registrar office?
- Yes I did.

1579
02:17:43,262 --> 02:17:45,111
But you're not there.

1580
02:17:46,071 --> 02:17:47,468
Why you didn't call me?

1581
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,142
What to do?
I got your letter.

1582
02:17:50,737 --> 02:17:53,451
It was written, do not
try to contact me.

1583
02:17:54,133 --> 02:17:56,260
I knew your family
had pressured you.

1584
02:17:56,816 --> 02:17:59,474
But I don't know... Jaggu...
I've a feeling that...

1585
02:18:00,030 --> 02:18:03,355
You will try to call me...

1586
02:18:05,966 --> 02:18:07,799
I called you a lot Jaggu...

1587
02:18:09,854 --> 02:18:10,910
What to do?

1588
02:18:12,647 --> 02:18:14,235
I have your wrong number...

1589
02:18:21,758 --> 02:18:23,820
Just now a friend found
me the right number...

1590
02:18:51,755 --> 02:18:52,755
Thank you, son.

1591
02:19:28,094 --> 02:19:29,776
Please hold this...

1592
02:19:54,081 --> 02:19:57,287
PK, you're going to take a bag
full of batteries with you?

1593
02:19:57,834 --> 02:20:00,137
I can't find them there, no?

1594
02:20:00,161 --> 02:20:02,310
But what will you do
with so many batteries?

1595
02:20:02,674 --> 02:20:04,992
This tape
recording's sound, right?

1596
02:20:05,302 --> 02:20:07,936
I want to hear them, at my home.
What kind of sound?

1597
02:20:08,507 --> 02:20:10,475
That of everyone's in this
world...

1598
02:20:10,958 --> 02:20:12,895
Animals, music
and traffic noise.

1599
02:20:13,062 --> 02:20:15,133
You're gonna hear
the traffic noise?

1600
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:18,275
If I miss this world. Then...

1601
02:20:19,028 --> 02:20:20,543
I will hear them all...

1602
02:20:23,232 --> 02:20:24,303
Hey Wait ...!

1603
02:20:24,453 --> 02:20:26,541
There's a second bag still...

1604
02:20:26,565 --> 02:20:28,144
PK, let it go...

1605
02:20:28,168 --> 02:20:31,675
How can I? It's all batteries
in there...

1606
02:20:32,262 --> 02:20:33,865
Listen...

1607
02:20:54,598 --> 02:20:57,987
You can listen to everyone
in your world?

1608
02:20:59,455 --> 02:21:02,376
Then they all walks nude?

1609
02:21:04,288 --> 02:21:06,793
What're you looking?
Something in my house?

1610
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:12,270
You know?

1611
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:14,413
I was ten years old.

1612
02:21:15,048 --> 02:21:16,762
When I first write a poem.

1613
02:21:18,397 --> 02:21:19,517
It is written for my father.

1614
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:23,730
Everyone says I look
like my mother.

1615
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:27,087
Everyone is right...

1616
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:36,390
Poetry that is...

1617
02:21:36,666 --> 02:21:38,358
Ensuring sound a few big story.

1618
02:21:40,556 --> 02:21:42,548
You're so cute.

1619
02:21:44,158 --> 02:21:47,158
One more to a friend who...

1620
02:21:53,602 --> 02:21:55,610
No animal sound nor music...

1621
02:21:56,125 --> 02:21:57,165
Nothing of traffic sound...

1622
02:21:58,387 --> 02:22:00,299
Every tape was just my voice.

1623
02:22:15,684 --> 02:22:16,684
I got it.

1624
02:22:22,525 --> 02:22:23,961
I was...

1625
02:22:28,491 --> 02:22:30,928
What did you record in this, PK?

1626
02:22:32,872 --> 02:22:35,531
I told you. Animal,
music, traffic's sound...

1627
02:22:48,053 --> 02:22:49,553
When I recall of this Earth...

1628
02:22:50,434 --> 02:22:51,910
Then, I'll listen to the tape.

1629
02:22:53,402 --> 02:22:57,084
I'll wave my hand
to you from there...

1630
02:22:57,813 --> 02:22:58,813
Like this...

1631
02:23:01,113 --> 02:23:02,962
I see you from there,
when you'll come...

1632
02:23:04,049 --> 02:23:05,247
Get the time...

1633
02:23:07,009 --> 02:23:08,609
You didn't have my voice
in there, right?

1634
02:23:10,429 --> 02:23:11,913
Your voice...

1635
02:23:13,198 --> 02:23:14,198
There is...

1636
02:23:14,857 --> 02:23:17,626
You read your poetry, yes?
I have it.

1637
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:21,118
Only one poetry?

1638
02:23:24,466 --> 02:23:26,386
Your love story maybe in it...

1639
02:23:27,322 --> 02:23:28,965
Which you waste
your time together...

1640
02:23:49,296 --> 02:23:51,205
He didn't look back even once...

1641
02:23:52,657 --> 02:23:54,348
Maybe he wants
to hide his tears...

1642
02:23:55,975 --> 02:23:57,118
He did learnt something...

1643
02:23:58,133 --> 02:23:59,213
He also taught something...

1644
02:24:01,244 --> 02:24:02,744
He learned to lie.

1645
02:24:04,132 --> 02:24:05,291
What did he taught...?

1646
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:07,791
The true meaning of love...

1647
02:24:09,172 --> 02:24:11,664
That "love
is enough to let me go".

1648
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:16,518
Just like when children come
to this world. Naked...

1649
02:24:16,838 --> 02:24:17,862
He too came naked.

1650
02:24:19,409 --> 02:24:21,457
Just like kids asking
many questions...

1651
02:24:22,933 --> 02:24:25,350
He also asked a lot
of questions.

1652
02:24:27,329 --> 02:24:28,575
Then one day...

1653
02:24:31,789 --> 02:24:32,789
He went away.

1654
02:24:35,741 --> 02:24:38,638
We are very far
from each other...

1655
02:24:41,662 --> 02:24:44,185
I think I was given a beautiful
gift...

1656
02:24:47,502 --> 02:24:48,621
Sarfaraz...

1657
02:24:50,765 --> 02:24:51,765
And my father.

1658
02:24:55,892 --> 02:24:57,312
As long as I live...

1659
02:24:58,137 --> 02:24:59,931
Every night I'll look
at the star...

1660
02:25:01,225 --> 02:25:02,248
Waving him...

1661
02:25:05,017 --> 02:25:06,040
I'm sure...

1662
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:08,008
He'll do like this too...

1663
02:25:12,809 --> 02:25:13,904
I miss him.

1664
02:25:48,578 --> 02:25:52,872
One year later...

1665
02:25:54,403 --> 02:25:58,475
Brothers. We are one hour
to land on Earth.

1666
02:25:58,903 --> 02:26:02,712
Don't forget what I taught you.
Just 4 points.

1667
02:26:03,116 --> 02:26:05,839
First, walking nude
is prohibited on Earth...

1668
02:26:06,355 --> 02:26:08,648
Kissing and the likes,

1669
02:26:08,672 --> 02:26:11,656
People here do it secretly
and discreetly...

1670
02:26:11,798 --> 02:26:15,806
Beside that, peeing, pooping, beating,
all can do loud and openly...

1671
02:26:16,258 --> 02:26:19,774
Second, the big confusion
here is the language.

1672
02:26:20,021 --> 02:26:21,837
If you listen something like...

1673
02:26:21,861 --> 02:26:23,646
I love chickens, I love fish...

1674
02:26:23,805 --> 02:26:27,249
That doesn't mean
that they love that animals...

1675
02:26:27,558 --> 02:26:32,138
But it means that, they love eating
chickens, or eating fish for lunch.

1676
02:26:32,622 --> 02:26:35,471
What they think, what they say,
and what they mean.

1677
02:26:35,496 --> 02:26:37,249
We have to research about it...

1678
02:26:37,939 --> 02:26:41,209
Third, collect clothes
from the dancing car...

1679
02:26:41,566 --> 02:26:44,748
And hide your remote control
in your underwear...

1680
02:26:44,882 --> 02:26:48,613
Nobody will steal it if you
put it deep inside...

1681
02:26:49,049 --> 02:26:52,081
And fourth
the most important point.

1682
02:26:52,596 --> 02:26:56,707
If you ever meet with someone
saying he can contact God.

1683
02:26:56,873 --> 02:27:01,207
Do not research it... Just get
ready, and run at full speed.

1684
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:16,490
Come bro. Don't be scared.
Come...

1685
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:23,686
What are you staring at, huh?

1686
02:27:25,415 --> 02:27:27,733
- I have a question.
- What is it?

1687
02:27:29,034 --> 02:27:33,653
That last trip,
how many slap did you get?

1688
02:27:41,563 --> 02:27:43,610
What's these?

1689
02:27:43,719 --> 02:27:46,720
Self-defense. Really, Safety?
Yup.

1690
02:27:47,323 --> 02:27:48,799
- Ok, Come on...
- Go.

1691
02:27:48,823 --> 02:27:51,315
Where are you going?
Go here...

1692
02:27:51,339 --> 02:29:51,439
Hope it helped... >bozxphd
