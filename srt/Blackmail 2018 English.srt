00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,890
Pandey, You Need glasses!

3
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Who's that?

4
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,550
Is that you... Dev Sir?

5
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
You're always cropped
under the table..

6
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,800
How will I see you? One sec...

7
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,180
Sir, if I may ask..

8
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,390
Why don't you go home early?

9
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,470
Aren't you married?

10
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,826
Marriage is a celebration
in countryside.

11
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,550
In Big cities, it is a regret.

12
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,100
Oh no.

13
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,800
"O crazy heart better
brace yourself."

14
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,800
"You must know how to
pleasure yourself."

15
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,890
"Don't think twice and,
just do-do-do it.."

16
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,220
"Just do this sin...!"

17
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,970
"The world's full
of disappointment."

18
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,800
"Your happiness is
in your Palm.."

19
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:40,220
"Don't wait..and
celebrate this joy."

20
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,390
"Just do this sin...!"

21
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,140
"As they say that.."

22
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,010
"even walls have ears."

23
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,026
"So do it without
making a noise."

24
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,890
"You don't need anyone's help.."

25
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,550
"cause you're a proud man."

26
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,470

Hello-Hello-Hello..

41
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:01,430
"I gave you..my delicate heart."

42
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,390
"Don't ever break it..my love."

43
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:18,720

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,550
"don't ever share it
with anyone else."

45
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,470
Did you pay for the
Danadhan Tv subscription?

46
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I'll do it today.

47
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,600
"Julie-Julie-Julie..
You're not ordinary."

48
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,866
"I can even give my
life for your love.."

49
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,986
"Hey lover-boy, don't
try to flirt with me."

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,640
"Don't try to get in my way..."

51
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,760
Alright, listen up, listen up.
Boss is talking.

52
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,350
Everyone has a roll?

53
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:56,236
Awesome!

54
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,760
Okay, we've two big
announcements today.

55
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,406
First; We have a new addition
to the 'My Handy' team.

56
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,010
Prabha Ghatpande.

57
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,260
Please give her a big
round of applause.

58
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:11,486
Never mind.

59
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,760
- Pandey.
- Yes, sir.

60
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,760
Sensation is the new
motto of our company..

61
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,986
She's a virgin.

62
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,236
And what you are holding is
our new toilet paper rolls.

63
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,510
I can tell by just
looking at her.

64
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,486
3 times softer, more
absorbent, and colorful.

65
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,260
And now..

66
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,640
Just close your eyes..

67
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,050
And feel this toilet paper.
Like this.

68
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,430
You felt it!

69
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,986
I saw your eyes open.
You felt it.

70
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,776
- Sir..
- You felt it.

71
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,276
- Yes.. tell me..
- Sir, it's the pin..

72
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,680
No, even my eyes
opened like this.

73
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,640
When I first felt it
on my cheeks, it was..

74
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,470
Magical.

75
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,760
You know, I always wondered..

76
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,470
In a country, where we don't
have enough water to drink..

77
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,390
How do people find water
to clean their backside?

78
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,680
And then I realized..

79
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,300
It's not about the water.

80
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,680
It's about the
touch of the hand!

81
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,760
And this toilet paper comes
closest to that touch!

82
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,930
What? You don't believe me.

83
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,720
Oh you will.

84
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,736
Now, one by one..

85
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,430
You will rub this
on your cheeks.

86
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,930
No, I am not talking
about these cheeks.

87
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,390
I'm telling you, dude.

88
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,430
His father was doing a good job.

89
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,026
Sales were good.

90
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,890
God knows what knowledge this
Jackass has got from America.

91
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,800
Wiping one's butt has become
a psychological research.

92
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,076
In fact, given a chance
this guy would..

93
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,390
Pull down people's pants
himself, and..yuck!

94
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,800
He is crazy. Coming?

95
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,220
"Disappear into your
own little world."

96
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,430
"Make yourself scarce
like a secret."

97
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:37,050
"Make your plans right now."

98
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,100
Prabha.

99
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,100
What a divine name.

100
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
No one keeps such names anymore.

101
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,760
But if you think, the
name can even arouse you.

102
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,760
Say it.

103
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,010
Prabha!

104
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,930
What's up bro... I've noticed you're
always in a bad mood these days.

105
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,550
Is everything okay at home?

106
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,696
I mean, Pandey told me..

107
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,850
You stay in the office
till late hours.

108
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,100
Don't mind..and, I don't
mean any disrespect.

109
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,760
Your wife's really gorgeous.

110
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,850
But..you don't value her.

111
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,300
Your Marriage is
like a Rock Ballet..

112
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,390
Don't turn it into
a Church Gospel.

113
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,600
Trust me; just give
it to her tonight!

114
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,850
Surprise!

115
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,890
Women love surprises.

116
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,680
And don't forget
to take flowers.

117
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,300
I'm speaking from experience.

118
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Got it.

119
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,890
Leaving early, sir?

120
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,276
There is a flower shop
downstairs, right?

121
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,276
- Will it be open?
- I think..

122
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,850
Ohh... it's Wednesday.

123
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,210
Flower market's closed today.

124
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,510
- The entire flower market's closed today?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:47,640
[Song playing on TV]

126
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,050
- Yeah Baby.
- What are you doing Ranjit.

127
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,260
Surprise..

128
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,760
One day he'll barge
in saying that.

129
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,800
And we'll be gasping.

130
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,600
Stop it, Ranjit.

131
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,850
You make everything
sound so vulgar.

132
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,600
Dev always texts me before
he leaves for home.

133
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,800
That's true.

134
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,680
By the way.. What does
this Dev look like?

135
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,390
Like a husband.

136
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,470
- Dev..
- We didn't do it.

137
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,640
Dev! Dev! Dev! Dev..

138
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,800
- No, no.. Dev..
- We didn't do it.

139
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,890
- No, no.. Dev..Dev, please.
- No! No!

140
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,550
"I gave you.."

141
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,100
"my delicate heart."

142
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:54,100
"I gave you..my delicate heart."

143
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:01,930
"Don't ever break it..my love."

144
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:11,100
"The bond we share.."

145
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:18,390
"don't ever share it
with anyone else."

146
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,890
"Never.."

147
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,196
"Because you're my bliss.."

148
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,850
"Because you're my bliss.."

149
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,696
"Because you're my bliss.."

150
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720

"Because you're my bliss.."

153
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,776
"Because you're my bliss.."

154
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,100
"my love."

163
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,350
"my love."

164
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,390
You're back, Tommy.

165
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,550
Tommy..

166
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,010
Come here. Here Boy.

167
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,680
What's this 'Tommy' nonsense?

168
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
So should I straight
call you a Dog!

169
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,720
- Dolly, please..
- Tommy wait, stop..

170
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,180
Wait..stop..excuse me.

171
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,550
Where were you dicking around?

172
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Hey..

173
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,003
Whose rotten food were you
feasting on... Tell me.

174
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:48,390
Dolly!

175
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,260
Hey, Tommy.

176
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,010
Forget it.

177
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,140
Let me take a look at your neck.

178
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,180
What if someone put
a leash on you?

179
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,100
But how can someone
put a leash on you?

180
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,800
After all, you're a mangy cur.

181
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,576
Must be lying in a dumpster!

182
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,300
Dolly!

183
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,430
Don't bark!

184
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,640
Just tell me where you had been.

185
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,526
Otherwise..I'll tell papa..

186
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,430
To stop giving you the
10,000 rupees every week.

187
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
I went to a bar..

188
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
With my friends.

189
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,970
Bar?

190
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,850
Friends?

191
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,180
Vishal, Sumit, and Bhonsle!

192
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,026
My old gym trainers. We
used to work together.

193
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,050
Feel free to ask.

194
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,850
Who paid?

195
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,100
It was Bhonsle's treat.

196
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,100
You're such a freeloader.

197
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,430
You're already sucking us dry..

198
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,120
At least leave your
friends alone.

199
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:50,144
Friends don't mind.

200
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,510
Then let them pay for
your expenses as well.

201
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,390
And leave me alone.

202
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,350
And stop cutting your
nose hair all the time.

203
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Mister..

204
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,300
Please call Jatin.

205
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,576
- Who?
- Jatin. Jatin.

206
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,680
He just went inside.

207
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,220
There is no Jatin here.

208
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,890
- Isn't this Jatin Gupta's house?
- No.

209
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
I see..

210
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,760
10 secrets ways to find
out someone's name..

211
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,930
Even I have this
Whatsapp message.

212
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,430
You want his name?

213
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,720
Do you want his name?

214
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,076
Yes.

215
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,220
100 rupees.

216
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,140
Dolly Verma.

217
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,800
Corporator Digpal
Verma's daughter.

218
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,220
And the guy who
just went inside?

219
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,010
100 rupees more.

220
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,800
Ranjit Arora..

221
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,800
Dolly Verma's husband!

222
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,850
Did you pay the
Dhanadan Tv Bill?

223
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,350
Dev.. I am asking you. Bill..

224
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,850
So..how was the surprise?

225
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,470
What's wrong? She
didn't like it.

226
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,050
I see.

227
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,100
Which flowers did you take?

228
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Roses?

229
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,260
Damn...

230
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,260
That's where you went wrong.

231
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,850
You should've got
orchids instead.

232
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,140
She would've kissed you.

233
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,760
I'm speaking from experience.

234
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,866
Anyway..let me lighten
your mood with a joke.

235
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,890
Don't worry.

236
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,180
After dinner, husband
to his brother.

237
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,800
'You know what, your sister-in-law
is really blessed.'

238
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,530
'The food she makes
satisfies my soul!'

239
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,001
Brother to husband, 'why of
course, she is truly blessed.'

240
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:55,010
'Because it's not just you, it's the entire
neighbourhood that she has satisfied'

241
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,050
Husband faints.

242
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,866
- Dev my man.
- Sir.

243
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,550
I've got a present for you.

244
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,890
I bought this during
my college time..

245
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,100
At George Town, Kentucky..

246
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,050
It got me through
my darkest hours.

247
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,800
And now, it's yours.

248
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:16,276
Sir.

249
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Take it.

250
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,470
The point is that
now you need it.

251
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,446
I know you're reeling under a lot
of pressure of your Home Loan.

252
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:25,986
Sir.

253
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,050
- And you've raise due as well.
- Sir.

254
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,800
But, I can't give you
a raise at this time.

255
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,850
Sir..m..my..my EMI..

256
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,826
- Sir, my EMis are..
- I get it.

257
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,390
- My..
- No, no, I get it.

258
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,430
But the company is going
through a transition..

259
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,100
For it's ultimate glory.

260
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,010
And we need all the funds.

261
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,930
First of all; Our sales
are an all-time low.

262
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,300
And we're up against
our greatest threat.

263
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,010
The jet-spray.

264
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,470
Typical middle-class invention.

265
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Have you tried it?

266
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
Have you tried it?

267
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:04,576
What, sir?

268
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
The jet-spray.

269
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
No, sir.

270
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,906
- Should I?
- No!

271
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,276
It's disgusting.

272
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,860
Half the time's wasted
in trying to aim.

273
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,680
Such a waste of water.

274
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,640
Sit-sit-sit.

275
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,010
I've got to stop it
at all cost, Dev.

276
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,050
For the future of the
next generation.

277
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,800
Because I care.

278
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,470
And I know you do too.

279
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,100
Before..I saw your eyes open.

280
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,300
No, sir, it was
just a pin that..

281
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,100
You see, the Third World War..

282
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,890
Will be fought for water.

283
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,930
And the only thing that
can save it, is this.

284
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,260
Do you want to see the
Third World War, Dev?

285
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Huh, Dev?

286
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
No, sir.

287
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,220
Yeah..exactly..

288
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,600
And that's why I have decided..

289
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,220
That you'll be leading our
new toilet-paper campaign.

290
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,100
This is much better
than a raise, Dev.

291
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,720
So make sure you
shake it up, Dev.

292
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,470
Alright.

293
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Shake it up!

294
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,550
Hello, is that Mr. Dev speaking?

295
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,050
This is Vaishali speaking from
New Bombay Co-operative Bank!

296
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,100
Sir, your last
month's EMI is due.

297
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,300
When will you make payment?

298
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,770
'Did you pay for the
Dhanadhan Tv subscription?'

299
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:31,850
'Surprise.. Someday he'll come
barging inside saying that!'

300
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,180
'The company is going
through a transition.'

301
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,220
'And we'll be gasping.'

302
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,720
'I can't give you a
raise right now.'

303
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,720
'Ranjit Arora..'

304
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,050
'Dolly Verma's husband.'

305
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,656
'How does he look?'

306
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,260
'Like a husband.'

307
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,010
'When will you make payment?'
Tomorrow or day after..

308
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Hello.

309
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,470
Day after..

310
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,010
Sir, cash or cheque?

311
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,890
Hello.

312
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,076
Cash!

313
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,010
- Morning or evening?
- Evening!

314
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,300
Thank you sir.

315
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,236
It's got dual-sim, radio, LED
torch, 20 hour battery life.

316
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
Only 1500.

317
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
1500?

318
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,100
Fine, I'll take it.

319
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,600
And a prepaid sim-card as well.

320
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
"Revenge!"

321
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,220
He could've sold credit-cards
or even underwear..

322
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,640
But toilet paper?

323
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,076
Fine..I know it's
nothing to brag about..

324
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,930
But, it's not all that bad.

325
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,180
You know..

326
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,600
You were really hasty
in getting married.

327
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
What?

328
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,350
I got married in a haste?

329
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,930
What did you say to me?

330
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm going to Igatpuri for
four weeks to learn Yoga.

331
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,930
But you returned after 6 months
with a Mercedes and a wife.

332
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,470
And I was hasty?

333
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,300
Speak up.

334
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,600
Soy milk reduces cholesterol.
Try it.

335
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,890
Shut up.

336
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,970
Idiot.

337
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,640
It's such a pain to
read these texts.

338
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,300
Ma..Married..

339
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,930
Married woman..

340
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,076
Affair!

341
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,260
Text: Affair with
a married woman??

342
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,720
Text: What do you want?

343
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,510
He's not picking up.

344
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,510
Who is it?

345
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,670
He is asking for just 100,000!

346
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,510
- Do you have 100,000?
- No!

347
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,140
- Then how is it 'just' 100,000?
- Yeah..

348
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
Correct!

349
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,510
Who can it be?

350
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
I don't know.

351
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,850
Damn, He wants it tomorrow!

352
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,600
Just pay him.

353
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,430
- Pay him?
- Yes.

354
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,366
I don't even have money for protein powder.
There is no money.

355
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,050
Then ask your wife.

356
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,140
You married her for money right?

357
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,430
No money.

358
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,430
You know I am treated
like a dog in that house.

359
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,406
I get meat only on Sundays.

360
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,446
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

361
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,930
Ranjit, please.

362
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,430
Your wife is our only hope.
You get it!

363
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,366
Do something.. anything..

364
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,910
Make some excuse, or
cook up a story..

365
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:34,144
But you have to do something, or
else we'll get in big trouble.

366
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,010
What if Dev finds out?

367
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,236
He says he'll tell Dolly.

368
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,470
- S♪♪♪ - Ranjit! Ranjit!

369
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,300
"Teach the king a lesson."

370
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,970
"Show him the might
of a knight."

371
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:17,220
"Go on a picnic with the queen."

372
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,510
Baby..

373
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,890
Baby?

374
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,550
Last time you called
me 'baby' was in 2010.

375
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,930
Back then you wanted a Mercedes.

376
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,510
What do you want now freeloader?

377
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,220
Exactly.

378
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,850
I am tired of begging.

379
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,510
From You! From Papa.

380
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,010
I've finally decided.

381
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,410
I'm going to start
my own business.

382
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,510
But..

383
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,180
Business?

384
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Okay..

385
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,350
What business?

386
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,390
Huh?

387
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,010
What business are
you going to do?

388
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,350
Import business.

389
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,430
Only import. And no export.

390
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,350
No..I'll export as well.

391
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,640
Import and Export.

392
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,970
Okay.

393
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,140
So what are you going to import
and what will you export?

394
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,430
So what are you
going to import..

395
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,010
And what will you
export, you dog?

396
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
Dogs!

397
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,180
Huh!

398
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,470
Dogs!

399
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,236
I'll import them from Taiwan..

400
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,680
And export them to China.

401
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,010
It's got a great scope.
No one else is doing it.

402
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,866
I have a friend who's
a dog breeder..

403
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,406
And he has all the information.

404
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,930
We are in it together.

405
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,050
Which friend?

406
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,470
That..Dev

407
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,470
Dev..

408
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,446
Why are you sc♪♪♪
up poor Dev's life?

409
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,140
Dolly, listen..

410
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,470
I want to change..

411
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,850
Honestly.

412
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,010
For me.

413
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,510
For you.

414
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:26,970
For us!

415
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,350
And guess, what I
need for all this?

416
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,470
Just 100,000 rupees.

417
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,300
There..now you're showing
your true colors.

418
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,866
Baby, if I was sc♪♪♪ with you..

419
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,100
Would I have said anything
less than 5 million?

420
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Think?

421
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,720
Am I going to lie for 100,000?

422
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,550
Please, baby.

423
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,350
Please..

424
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,300
I'll think about it.

425
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Huh!

426
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,510
I'll think about it.

427
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,550
Okay.

428
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,430
I said Hello!

429
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:18,616
To Whom?

430
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,406
The new girl...

431
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,430
Prabha.

432
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,510
She's a very decent girl.

433
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,140
I am sure she has never
French-kissed in her life.

434
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,180
Girls who French-kiss
have puffy lips.

435
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,140
But her lips are very
delicate, sweet.

436
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,970
There she is.

437
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,350
- Prabha.
- Yeah.

438
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Have you met Dev?

439
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,326
- Hi.
- Nice meeting you.

440
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,696
In case you need anything..

441
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Or you need help with something...
you can ask Dev.

442
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,156
Of course... after all you're
heading the new campaign.

443
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,850
Yeah.

444
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,260
We will talk later.

445
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,300
Cool.. See you then.

446
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,220
Some rascal stole
my wife's photo.

447
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,300
Who, sir?

448
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,390
Come, let me show you.

449
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,100
That MOFO..Pandey.

450
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,526
He lusts after my wife.

451
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,470
I have seen it in his eyes.

452
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,220
But sir, Pandey..

453
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,220
You just keep an eye on him for me.
Okay.

454
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:31,156
Yes, sir.

455
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:31,680
Alright.

456
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,970
Now let's get to work.

457
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,100
Something incredible
happened today.

458
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,946
This morning, I was using the
toilet paper like always..

459
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,640
When suddenly, I
had an epiphany.

460
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,236
An idea which will make people..

461
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,010
Desperate to buy
our toilet paper.

462
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,470
Guns don't kill
people, bullets do.

463
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,430
Without the bullet,
the gun won't fire.

464
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,550
You get it.

465
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,010
- I get it.
- Alright.

466
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,550
Now, on the day of
our product launch..

467
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,350
You'll turn off the water
supply for this entire area.

468
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,220
I will turn off the water
supply for this entire area?

469
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,100
Me? I can't do it, sir.

470
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:28,550
Dev..a woman in Jharkhand
married a dog.

471
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,600
- Sir..
- Dev.. Dev..

472
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,800
This is India.
Anything is possible.

473
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,156
So..go to the Municipal
Commissioner's office..

474
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,890
And get it done.

475
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,260
Cut off the water supply.

476
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,300
And let's see how these
people wash their backside.

477
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,720
Seriously..Jharkhand.

478
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,720
That reminds me of
an incredible joke.

479
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,026
These days there's a very popular
cougar joke doing rounds...

480
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,100
Name's Moon.

481
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:08,760
Pappu returns from school
and tells aunt Moon.

482
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,760
Aunt Moon.. Aunt Moon...

483
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,800
- You know the teacher today..
- I'll tell you a joke today.

484
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,446
- Huh..
- I'll tell you a joke today.

485
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:15,930
Listen..

486
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,100
You?

487
00:45:17,266 --> 00:45:19,026
- You're going to tell a joke.
- Just listen.

488
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,196
- No, no, no..
- Just listen.

489
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,800
Fine..tell me.

490
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,180
Hold on..

491
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,220
- Now tell me.
- One day..

492
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,640
A husband returns home
early from work..

493
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,640
With flowers to
surprise his wife.

494
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Flower.

495
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,720
He gets home.

496
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,970
But in the bedroom..

497
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:46,736
He sees his wife is
sleeping with another man.

498
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,510
What the.. That's
my kind of joke.

499
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:50,656
Listen..

500
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
Yeah, what next.

501
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,760
- Guess what the husband does next?
- What?

502
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,890
The husband starts
blackmailing the guy.

503
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Your wife?

504
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,180
Oh my, God.

505
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,100
Ohh... that rose day?

506
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,640
Why didn't you catch
her red-handed?

507
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,260
I want to teach them a lesson.

508
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,890
Ohh for god's sake...

509
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,100
That guy was bonking your wife.

510
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,100
Why didn't you beat him up?

511
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,720
I don't like violence.

512
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:52,100
Great... You don't like violence
but you are okay with blackmail?

513
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,180
Because I need the money.

514
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,180
Hold on..

515
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,550
Do you want to teach him a
lesson or take money from him?

516
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Both.

517
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,640
Both.

518
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,680
Buddy..

519
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,850
I've seen in films..

520
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:25,050
Its people like you who turn out to
be the serial killer in the end.

521
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,390
How much did you ask for?

522
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,600
"Revenge."

523
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,050
"When life screws your plans.
Embarrasses you, my man."

524
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,680
"Plays you like a fiddle. Makes
and example out of you."

525
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,986
"When you're out for revenge and
you're hit below the belt.."

526
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,530
"You see the devil
in beloved's face."

527
00:48:13,554 --> 00:48:14,616
"Only one way to get out."

528
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,026
"Dump your problems on someone
else, your happiness, his fear."

529
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,116
"Forget the rest and
do what you care."

530
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,406
"Your life is yours to bear."

531
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,076
"Life's going to stab you in the
back stick it all the way across."

532
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,140
"It's going to tear up your plans.
So be prepared.."

533
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:26,446
"No one knows which
way the world spins."

534
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,760
"The crow takes the shine,
and the crane's polluted.."

535
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,196
"Money's the main factor
here, creating a stir."

536
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,656
"This jungle's disdain.
Your loss is his gain."

537
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,196
"Don't be greedy, What
is the worth of money."

538
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,656
"You're smart, you know it, don't
let the out of your head."

539
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,406
"Like a butterfly
chasing a cheater."

540
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,550
"They look decent, but
inside they are evil."

541
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,616
"Make them all pay.."

542
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
"Keep all the money
for yourself."

543
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,446
"It's the new rule of life.
- Cheat your own people."

544
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,850
"You must beat your own
people, in order to win."

545
00:48:51,986 --> 00:48:52,986
"Game on baby."

546
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,470
"Revenge."

547
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,576
"Who won, and who lost."

548
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,076
"Flip a coin and do a toss."

549
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,776
"The world is unforgiving,
so don't be Santa Claus."

550
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,196
"He's dipping his
chips, in your sauce."

551
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,576
"Cross plus double cross."

552
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,406
"The world's unforgiving, it
deserves to be taught a lesson."

553
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,906
"It deserves to be
taught a lesson."

554
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,576
"It deserves to be
taught a lesson."

555
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,600
"Revenge."

556
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,930
"Revenge."

557
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,600
"Revenge."

558
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,220
"Revenge."

559
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,050
He wasn't ready to believe it.

560
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,390
It was really incredible,
Dolly, you know..

561
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,970
Import-Export!

562
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,350
Yes, papa.

563
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,100
Dolly told me..

564
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:11,550
That you're going to start
an import-export business.

565
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,260
Yes, papa.

566
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,390
Bravo, son.

567
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,276
Dolly, I always knew he'll
do something so great..

568
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,220
That I will be forced to
proudly shake hands with him.

569
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,100
Dolly dear, get me a drink.

570
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,390
You dog, your entire family..

571
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,220
Rummaged leftovers
from the garbage.

572
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,930
And you will do import-export?

573
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,390
You pulled a fast
one on my daughter.

574
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,390
But don't try to fool me.

575
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,470
You know my history, don't you?

576
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,550
I tried to get you
killed three times.

577
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,526
But, thanks to my
daughter's prayers..

578
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,100
You survived every time.

579
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,600
If you don't return this
money in three days..

580
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:11,260
I will make sure the prayers
go unheard this time.

581
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,100
Malti.

582
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,970
Get the ice.

583
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,760
- What's going on?
- Handshake.

584
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,850
Happy Anniversary Dolly dear.

585
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,550
Happy Diwali Dolly dear.

586
00:52:02,076 --> 00:52:03,076
Happy Birthday.

587
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,220
- Yes, papa.
- Smile, please.

588
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:53,680
E-mail: Affair with
a married man.

589
00:52:55,890 --> 00:53:01,050
E-mail: I want 1,20,000/-
or I will tell Dev.

590
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,010
The entire city is
demanding more water..

591
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,300
And this guy wants me to shut the
water supply for an entire day.

592
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,470
Not the entire day.

593
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,430
10 pm to 10 am.

594
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,760
12 hours..

595
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,866
There's a guy protesting
outside my office..

596
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,140
Because he didn't get water
supply for four hours.

597
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,736
Mister..I don't want
to turn my office..

598
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,260
Into a protest area, understand.

599
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,026
I thought we'll do as you say..

600
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,220
A little give and take..

601
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,430
What did you say?

602
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,550
- You did.
- No.

603
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,260
Come back later.

604
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,800
Hey..

605
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,100
Sit down. Sit down.

606
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,800
I said sit down.

607
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:55,850
Go on.

608
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:59,390
Yes.

609
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,640
You know I think it's awesome!

610
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,470
I had one idea..

611
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
Just a moment.

612
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,390
Hey Dev..

613
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Yeah, sir..

614
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,300
It's difficult.

615
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,260
He's demanding 2.4 million.

616
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,100
That's a great deal.

617
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,720
Sir..I said 2.4 million.

618
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,180
That's 200,000 per hour.

619
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,366
Dev, you're a
brilliant salesmen..

620
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,430
But you have no clue
about business.

621
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,850
Mark my words.

622
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,616
My marketing strategy..

623
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,720
Will be taught in Princeton,
Harvard, and Cambridge.

624
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,260
So shake on it, Dev.
Shake on it.

625
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,720
I've got two words.

626
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,300
Russian Blondes.

627
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,180
'Okay stand straight.'

628
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,430
'Super.. Now put your
hand on the shoulder.'

629
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,580
What kind of place
is this, Ranjit?

630
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:57,050
Where else could we meet?

631
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,930
This is the safest place.

632
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,050
Listen..

633
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,600
We're getting blackmailed
by the same guy.

634
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
Really?

635
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:09,470
Look at the message.

636
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,890
Both the messages are
in the same style.

637
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,350
Hindi spelled in English.

638
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,430
Yeah..

639
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,390
But where will I get
120,000 rupees?

640
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,890
We can't go to the
Police either, right?

641
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,470
Police.. not at all.

642
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:32,800
You had a job before
marriage, right?

643
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,180
You must have some savings.

644
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,850
What savings?

645
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,220
I guess... its hardly 30,000.

646
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,550
We still need 90,000/-

647
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:44,550
You have to pay.

648
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,470
Mom, I need some money.

649
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,720
90,000!

650
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:01,640
90,000?

651
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,100
Have you seen our condition?

652
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,640
We've nothing left.

653
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,970
We've sold everything for
your father's treatment.

654
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:11,100
And now he's even lost
control on his bladder.

655
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,030
I've to make these
adult diapers for him.

656
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,570
In fact, Dev should be
lending us a hand..

657
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:19,274
But, he wants to borrow
from us instead.

658
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:20,850
He's only asking for a loan.

659
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,140
He will pay it back.

660
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:23,390
Pass me bobbin..

661
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,640
If that scoundrel Ranjit
hadn't ditched you..

662
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,260
We wouldn't have forced
you to marry Dev.

663
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:35,010
Who knew there's a rascal
behind that innocent face?

664
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,220
Please, mom.

665
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,680
Can you lend me the money?

666
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,640
You know what..

667
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,100
Sell your father's kidney.

668
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,180
Drinking water again.

669
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,010
How many times do
you drink water?

670
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,120
The doctor has advised
you against it.

671
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:54,304
But why sell my kidney?

672
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,140
Forget it.

673
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,050
Dev..

674
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,510
Dev, I needed 90,000.

675
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,350
90,000? But why?

676
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,550
Papa needs to get
some tests done.

677
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:16,220
What test cost 90,000?

678
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:18,970
Angiography.

679
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:24,640
Dev..I wouldn't have asked
if it wasn't for father.

680
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:28,970
Please.

681
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,300
Fine, I'll give you tomorrow.

682
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,350
Congratulations, buddy.

683
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,180
Prabha has agreed for a date.

684
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,790
I am taking her to
our usual bar..

685
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,330
That's where I'll get her drunk.

686
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,790
She's a virgin, after all,
that's the way it's done.

687
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,010
Same old trick.

688
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,680
One coke bottle and
four large vodkas.

689
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,220
Doesn't smell, you know.

690
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,970
And then..I'm going test
the suspension of my car.

691
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,350
That's called rape.

692
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:04,930
What..

693
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,430
Yeah right..

694
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,850
As if you are doing
social service.

695
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,100
Blackmailer.

696
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,300
Right?

697
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:17,930
What did you call me?

698
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,116
Don't you dare say
that word again?

699
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,390
You better forget..

700
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,930
Everything that I
told you yesterday.

701
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,260
I have.

702
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,100
What?

703
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:29,350
I forgot.

704
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,100
I mean..

705
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,220
I am only joking, dude.

706
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
Look at your face.

707
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,100
Okay listen.

708
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,680
- Have you ever done it in a car?
- A car?

709
00:58:47,576 --> 00:58:48,576
Yeah, baby..

710
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,510
Dev gave me the money.

711
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,300
Dev's a really great guy.

712
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,326
We must pay the
blackmailer tonight.

713
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:56,550
I know..

714
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,050
How are you going to get there?

715
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,000
I've borrowed my friend's car.
What difference does it make?

716
00:59:02,024 --> 00:59:03,444
Are you coming along?

717
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,680
Me...?

718
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,140
No, I've to take Dolly
out for dinner.

719
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,510
Ranjit, please. I am scared!

720
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,800
There's no need to be scared.

721
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,430
They are dogs after all.

722
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,906
- What?
- Even if they bite you..

723
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,610
You'll just need a
rabies shot, that's all.

724
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:18,430
Be there on time.

725
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,680
- Hello?
- Okay..okay, bye-bye.

726
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,300
What?

727
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,880
That was my business partner.

728
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,350
The dogs have arrived.

729
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,050
Good.

730
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,680
Which breed?

731
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,470
Chihuahua.

732
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,849
Text: 90,000/- tonight...
at Kharghar Circle.

733
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:39,850
S♪♪♪

734
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,970
Customs have detained our dogs.

735
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,260
I must go.

736
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,640
Your tea, sir.

737
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,406
"I swear I'm going
to make you pay."

738
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,076
"I loved you so much
but you never cared."

739
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,656
"I know it tastes bitter but
it's the most effective."

740
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,390
"We're no longer one soul."

741
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:26,390
"No more running behind you I'm going
to get everything back you stole."

742
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,614
"Love maybe lost and there's
just darkness in my heart."

743
01:00:28,638 --> 01:00:30,826
"I loved you so much but
you didn't love me."

744
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,526
"I was yours, but you
were never mine.."

745
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,736
"and loved someone else."

746
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,156
"I admit..you looked
pretty naive."

747
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,300
"Game on baby.."

748
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,196
"Game on.."

749
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,220
"Revenge."

750
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,446
"Truth is always bitter
only revenge is sweet."

751
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,826
"I am gonna give you a shock
in return for all the pain."

752
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,140
"It's gonna scare
you every time."

753
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,326
"You will want to run away."

754
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,076
"Every step you take will
only cause you pain."

755
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,260
"It will kill you slowly-silently
and turn your life hell."

756
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,616
"I admit..you looked pretty naive.
Yes my wife."

757
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,850
"Game on baby.."

758
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,550
"Revenge."

759
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,800
"Through the heart, and
straight across.."

760
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,276
"Sick of this fake live."

761
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,026
"I am going to make you pay
for this deceit, my love.."

762
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,446
"Dare you rejected my love.."

763
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,826
"Now you must face
my disapproval?"

764
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:38,276
"I won't let you
off so easily.."

765
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,776
"Before I've had my revenge.."

766
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,276
"Before I've had my revenge.."

767
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,510
"Revenge."

768
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,800
Yes sir, this way.

769
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,330
They've decorated
the place today.

770
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:48,600
Sir.

771
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:49,776
Isn't this a nice place?

772
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Sit down.

773
01:01:51,736 --> 01:01:52,736
Your order sir.

774
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,986
One large vodka
and a soft drink.

775
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,010
Excuse me. Aren't
you going to drink?

776
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,300
No, I am..

777
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,140
- Waiter, two large vodkas.
- Yes sir.

778
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,300
Mili!

779
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,470
Hi!

780
01:02:11,736 --> 01:02:12,736
Beautiful.

781
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,300
Mili.

782
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:19,140
"She pierced my
heart..with a knife."

783
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:29,050
"She pierced my
heart..with a knife."

784
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:34,486
"She slowly..ruined my life."

785
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:39,696
"Spent the night in
someone's arms.."

786
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,640
"and robbed me of every
penny before leaving."

787
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,600
"Two-timing beauty.."

788
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,970
"cheated on me."

789
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,760
"Two-timing beauty.."

790
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,010
"cheated on me."

791
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,050
"Lying beloved.."

792
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:00,350
"cheated on me."

793
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,850
Seafood.

794
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,220
- Do you like fish?
- Yes..

795
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:08,930
Pomfret.

796
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,350
- I love when it's deep fried..
- Not that.

797
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:13,260
Pet fish. Goldfish.

798
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:15,600
I have two..

799
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,510
Sonu and Sonia.

800
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,260
Do you want to see?

801
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:27,736
"On the whole..the beloved
had good etiquettes.."

802
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,600
"but sweetheart was
a little impolite."

803
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:37,076
"You were a decent guy.."

804
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,300
"but she made you helpless."

805
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,720
Stop-stop-stop.

806
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,600
Do you like jokes?

807
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,140
There's a new cougar
joke doing rounds..

808
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,260
Her names Aunt Moon.

809
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,326
Pappu returns from school,
and tells her Aunt Moon...

810
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:55,430
'Aunt Moon, my
teacher asked me..

811
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,600
'What you want to do
when you grow up?'

812
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,050
Do you know what I said?

813
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,116
I said, teacher when I grow up..

814
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,813
..'I am going to get
on top of Moon, and..

815
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:06,510
Yuck!

816
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,760
"Cheated on me."

817
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,050
- Come on, let's go.
- No-no-no..

818
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:21,866
I'll tell you a decent one.

819
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,736
- This one's really decent.
- No, no, we're already late..

820
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,760
Please..please..

821
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,720
Hear it while you
finish your drink.

822
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:30,390
Yeah..

823
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,100
Decent one..

824
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:39,600
Once a husband goes home early
with flowers to surprise his wife.

825
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,236
As soon he gets home..

826
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,350
He sees his wife's in
bed with another man..

827
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,470
No, no, no, this one's really decent.
Just let me finish.

828
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,350
Do you know what the
husband does next?

829
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,850
He starts blackmailing
his wife's boyfriend.

830
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,260
What kind of a joke is that?

831
01:05:00,284 --> 01:05:04,034
That's exactly what I told Dev.

832
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:08,930
Blackmailing your wife's
boyfriend is not a joke..

833
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,600
Hold on.

834
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:19,180
Dev..is blackmailing
his wife's boyfriend.

835
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:23,430
And the boyfriend doesn't
know that it's Dev.

836
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:29,890
Has he asked for money?

837
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
How much?

838
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:34,850
50?

839
01:05:36,026 --> 01:05:37,026
50..

840
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,760
He's demanded 100,000!

841
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,430
I see.

842
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,220
Prabha..

843
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,970
- Prabha..
- Yes.

844
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,140
Please don't tell anyone.

845
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,510
- It's a big secret.
- I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.

846
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,470
- Swear?
- Swear.

847
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:01,890
Finish your drink.

848
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,890
Then we'll go see your goldfish.

849
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,220
"Two-timing beauty.."

850
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,350
"cheated on me."

851
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,220
"Two-timing beauty.."

852
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,350
"cheated on me."

853
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,430
"Lying beloved.."

854
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,680
"cheated on me."

855
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,850
Water covers 71% of the earth.

856
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,196
But did you know that
only Less than 2% of it..

857
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:50,156
Is available to 7 billion people
and millions of species..

858
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,640
We share the planet with.

859
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:55,760
Without water, life on
earth can't survive.

860
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,260
So let's join our hands and
pledge to save our water.

861
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,970
Let's pledge to
use toilet paper.

862
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,470
My Handy Toilet paper..

863
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,640
Save water, Save the planet.

864
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:14,550
So..what do you think?

865
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,550
It's awesome, I know.

866
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:22,510
I got 18 product inquiries
from all over the country.

867
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,970
My Handy is buzzing.

868
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:30,970
Bait!

869
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,350
Bait?

870
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,800
I've installed a CCTV
camera in this room.

871
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:42,470
Where?

872
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,140
I don't think you can spot it.

873
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,180
Eagle.

874
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:50,550
Eagle?

875
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,720
Bald Eagle.

876
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,680
Bald Eagle?

877
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:11,100
Now let's see how that
Pandey escapes this?

878
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,720
- Buddy, his wife's photos...
- Come with me.

879
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:55,930
Buddy.

880
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,010
What are you doing? Why
are you hitting me?

881
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,140
- Are you blackmailing me?
- Why will I blackmail you?

882
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,510
- Who left this on my table?
- My hand..

883
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,930
- Who left this on my table?
- Not me.

884
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:10,656
You didn't..

885
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,390
- Not me.
- Then who did?

886
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:13,100
- I don't know.
- You bloody..

887
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,260
- Not my right hand.
- Who did you tell?

888
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,760
I didn't tell anyone.

889
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:18,736
Prabha. Prabha.

890
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,510
Maybe.. Maybe..I told Prabha.

891
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,760
You told Prabha?

892
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:24,696
I was really drunk yesterday.

893
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,300
- You told Prabha?
- Yes, maybe.

894
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,800
I was really drunk yesterday.

895
01:09:32,156 --> 01:09:33,596
Maybe I blurted it
when I was drunk.

896
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,406
What did you tell her?

897
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,680
I don't remember.

898
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,970
She is really b♪♪♪

899
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,220
- She drinks more than me.
- Oh my god!

900
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,550
Even my wallet is missing
from last night.

901
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,550
Oh my, God.

902
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,120
I don't think she's
a virgin either.

903
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,526
Okay..only one month left
for the product launch.

904
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,300
I want the presentation ready.

905
01:09:49,466 --> 01:09:50,946
- Prabha. Prabha.
- I've to show sir..

906
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:52,010
Prabha, come here.

907
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,220
Just a second, sir.

908
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,000
I want the entire presentation
ready after the lunch break.

909
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:57,170
Assemble the entire team,
do whatever you have to..

910
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,470
I am calling you, it
will just take a second.

911
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,350
We'll continue..

912
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,010
- Come.
- Yes, sir.

913
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,760
- You think you're very smart.
- No, sir.

914
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,600
What happened?

915
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,930
Who wrote this?

916
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,616
I don't know..it wasn't me.

917
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,970
- Come here..
- Excuse me, sir..

918
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:19,010
Do you think you're too smart?

919
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,890
- Who do you think..
- Hey..

920
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:23,946
I've been enduring
for a while now..

921
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,406
And you are disrespecting me.

922
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,986
I'm calling you sir, ain't I?

923
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,300
So show some respect.

924
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,470
What is your problem? Are
you going to scream at me?

925
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,720
Are you going to scream at me?

926
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:33,850
- Are you?
- Did I scream? Did I?

927
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,826
- I don't say that.
- Then what is this? What is this?

928
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:39,196
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

929
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:41,446
Isn't that a stupid question?
I want money.

930
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,470
I don't have money..I don't..

931
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,050
- You don't have?
- No I don't have.

932
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,620
- So you won't give?
- No, I won't.

933
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,600
Fine, don't give..

934
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:52,430
I'll send a similar
note to your wife.

935
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:53,760
Is that fine?

936
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:57,140
Look..I'll kick you so hard.

937
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,600
Don't try to intimidate me.

938
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:25,470
What?

939
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,760
Answer me.

940
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,430
Should I send a
note to your wife?

941
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
Should I?

942
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,100
How much?

943
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,550
60,000.

944
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,616
- 20,000 - 50,000

945
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,776
- 25,000 - 40,000

946
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,600
- 30..final.
- Done!

947
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,930
This is the last time.

948
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,680
Excuse me, sir.

949
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:53,446
You look really cute
when you're angry.

950
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,470
30! 30!

951
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:11,550
Here's 20,000.

952
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,600
And the rest?

953
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,550
I'll return it in a month.

954
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,680
Seven days.

955
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,866
- Father..
- Five days.

956
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:21,180
- But..
- Four days.

957
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,656
Text: 30,000/- Rs Tonight.

958
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,930
Die you rascal.

959
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,640
Three days!

960
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:45,890
E-mail: 40,000/- Rs Tonight.

961
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:58,430
Text: Need 40,000 more for Dad's test.
URGENT!'

962
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:44,220
"You have no shame."

963
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:49,100
"You've a strange character."

964
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,800
"You numbskull.."

965
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,970
"Who brought you in this world?"

966
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,390
"Revenge.."

967
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,550
"Revenge.."

968
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,100
This is the first and
last time, okay.

969
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,680
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

970
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,600
Pandey!

971
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:28,010
Aghh..get out.

972
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,140
I should've known..

973
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:38,720
These poor, security guard, type
people can't afford boxers.

974
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:39,850
Yes, sir.

975
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,220
It's some other office employee.

976
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,760
Yes, sir.

977
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,550
But who?

978
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,600
Look-Look-Look..

979
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,760
It's the same girl
from last time..

980
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,970
But, with a different guy.

981
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,300
Ranjit, please focus.

982
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,550
What's the point?

983
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,680
Listen, I have an idea.

984
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:14,100
Why don't we hire a
private detective?

985
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,390
Have you lost your mind?
Private detective!

986
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,890
We'll get into a lot of trouble.

987
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:21,050
Then please do something.

988
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,050
I cannot ask Dev for more money.

989
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:04,970
It's okay, it's alright..

990
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,970
Destiny cannot be averted.

991
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:10,026
We're merely puppets in
the hands of destiny.

992
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:12,550
We were eating a meal together.

993
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:15,140
It's okay, it's alright..

994
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:20,470
We were eating a meal together.
And now he is no more..

995
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,100
What were you eating?

996
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,010
Kidney beans and rice.

997
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,026
You shouldn't be eating
kidney beans and rice..

998
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,811
In fact, you shouldn't eat kidney
beans at all. It upsets the stomach.

999
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:36,295
We haven't eaten kidney beans
for the last 10 years.

1000
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,430
Control yourself..

1001
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:39,550
I am right here.

1002
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,260
By the way, how did
you know it's me?

1003
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,680
Tell me.

1004
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,300
Do you suspect anyone?

1005
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,800
What's the reason for blackmail?

1006
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,390
"Affair with a married woman."

1007
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,640
- It just happened.
- It's okay.

1008
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:10,430
So..you must have a wife too.

1009
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,140
How do you know?

1010
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,300
Most of Chawla's
cases are like that.

1011
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:17,430
Boy with girl.. Girl with boy..

1012
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:19,550
These days a lot of
boys with boys too..

1013
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,526
Dogs, cats, cattle, sheep..
No one's safe these days.

1014
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:25,010
- You know, in Jharkhand..
- I get it.

1015
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:29,140
All I want to know is whether you
can find the blackmailer or not.

1016
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:30,850
Hold this.

1017
01:18:34,366 --> 01:18:35,366
Look..

1018
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,390
Read the third line.

1019
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:38,076
97% success..

1020
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,430
97% success rate!

1021
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,680
I hope I won't
fall under the 3%.

1022
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,430
- Let it be..
- No Sir..

1023
01:18:47,326 --> 01:18:48,326
Fees?

1024
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:48,930
20,000!

1025
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:50,906
10,000 advance.
10,000 after the job.

1026
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:54,526
Plus daily allowance. Food,
traveling, internet package.

1027
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:56,366
If you pay by cheque or RTGS..

1028
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:57,720
Then you'll be charged 18% GST.

1029
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:00,720
You can also get a bill if you want.
But with 5% Vat extra.

1030
01:19:01,776 --> 01:19:02,776
It's too much.

1031
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,640
It goes to the government,
we have no cut.

1032
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,930
The fee is too much.

1033
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,970
Not more than what you're
paying the blackmailer.

1034
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,800
So pay up.

1035
01:19:12,656 --> 01:19:13,656
Here?

1036
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,140
Yeah, they are all like family.
No need to worry.

1037
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:28,430
What will you do if I find
the blackmailer's name?

1038
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,850
I'll shoot him.

1039
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,010
You're very lucky.

1040
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,680
I must say very lucky.

1041
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,180
Why?

1042
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,366
Chawla even deals in guns.

1043
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:43,390
I see..

1044
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:48,550
By the way..where is Chawla?

1045
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,100
Uncle..

1046
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,010
No, son!

1047
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,890
Dev sir, for you.

1048
01:20:02,526 --> 01:20:03,526
Who gave it?

1049
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,010
Prabha madam..who
works in our office.

1050
01:20:11,616 --> 01:20:12,616
Where is she?

1051
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,970
She didn't come today.
Sick leave.

1052
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:17,970
She threw a party last night.
She invited everyone.

1053
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:19,640
Didn't she invite you?

1054
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,760
Fine.

1055
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,600
Yes, sir.

1056
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,680
Bablu..I need details
of a number.

1057
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,100
Stop showing attitude..

1058
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,260
Fine, I'll pay you 1000 rupees.

1059
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:41,930
Note down the number.

1060
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,350
885..

1061
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:46,930
Come, buddy.

1062
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:52,800
Listen..where does Prabha stay?

1063
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,026
You too.

1064
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,826
Last night I told you she's a..

1065
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,350
Just give me her address!

1066
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,760
What is it, Dev?

1067
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:16,180
We need to talk.

1068
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,680
Did you bring my money?

1069
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:20,800
That's what we need
to talk about.

1070
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,510
There won't be any negotiation.

1071
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,600
Open the door I need
to talk to you.

1072
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,640
Fine, I'm opening the door.

1073
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,550
Bablu, you took really long.

1074
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,680
What? Did you find him?

1075
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,760
What's his name?

1076
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:45,930
Dev..

1077
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:47,430
Dev Kaushal.

1078
01:21:48,076 --> 01:21:49,076
Great..

1079
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,260
Thank you.

1080
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,260
Why did you stop?

1081
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,076
Speak up, and make it quick.
What is it?

1082
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,850
Look, I cannot give
you any more money.

1083
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:00,736
I am already under a lot of pressure
to pay my loans for home, car..

1084
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,180
Your home's already broken.

1085
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:05,680
And you don't have
to pay anyway.

1086
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:07,366
You are demanding the money from
your wife's boyfriend, right?

1087
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:09,526
So just add my share as well.
Simple.

1088
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,026
I cannot ask for more money.

1089
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,550
Then don't..

1090
01:22:13,776 --> 01:22:14,776
Sell your house.

1091
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,180
I want my money.

1092
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:39,350
What?

1093
01:22:40,076 --> 01:22:41,076
Not again.

1094
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,180
Look at me and talk.

1095
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,550
When will you pay me?

1096
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,140
- I won't give you any more money.
- Huh.

1097
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:53,260
- I won't give you any more money.
- You won't.

1098
01:22:53,826 --> 01:22:54,826
Yes, I won't give
any more money.

1099
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,690
- Are you sure?
- You can do anything you want.

1100
01:22:56,714 --> 01:22:57,884
I can do anything.

1101
01:22:58,216 --> 01:22:59,616
Then I'm going to
tear my clothes..

1102
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,080
And scream that
you're raping me.

1103
01:23:01,104 --> 01:23:03,446
- Help!
- No, no, no.

1104
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,026
- Anybody there!
- No, no, no.

1105
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:07,470
- Anybody there!
- No, no, no.

1106
01:23:08,826 --> 01:23:09,826
Fine..

1107
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,550
So? When will you pay me?

1108
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:15,326
I'm leaving.

1109
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:16,930
Where..where are you going?
My money..

1110
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:46,850
Prabha.

1111
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,430
Wait. Wait.

1112
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,550
Asleep so soon?

1113
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,300
She knows we're coming.

1114
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:22,850
Prabha dear.

1115
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,300
I had a spare key.

1116
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:32,640
Open the door, dear.

1117
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,930
Yes I'm searching.

1118
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,680
Wait a minute.

1119
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,640
Found it. Found it. Here..

1120
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,350
Prabha!

1121
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,100
Prabha! Prabha!

1122
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,850
Hey Stop him!

1123
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:14,430
Stop!

1124
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,260
Stop!

1125
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:20,680
Hey catch him.

1126
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,760
Catch him!

1127
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,760
Stop!

1128
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,800
Where is he? Look there.

1129
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:40,350
Hey catch him!

1130
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,600
He must be somewhere around.
Find him.

1131
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:45,076
I think he went in
the back alley.

1132
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,656
Let's go.

1133
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,180
Stop there.

1134
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:52,600
Hey catch him!

1135
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,930
Look there also.

1136
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:58,150
Mister, did you see a
nude guy run past here.

1137
01:25:58,174 --> 01:26:00,480
Nude.. No, but someone ran
past here in an underwear.

1138
01:26:00,504 --> 01:26:02,406
Guys, he went this way.

1139
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:03,430
He went this way.

1140
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,300
She just joined us recently.

1141
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,220
This week?

1142
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,680
Yes sir.

1143
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,550
Okay.

1144
01:26:38,196 --> 01:26:39,196
Prabha.

1145
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,550
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

1146
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,156
Shinde, take
everyone's statement.

1147
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,180
Yes sir.

1148
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,470
What happened?

1149
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:51,220
Come to the cabin.

1150
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,850
Coffee? Tea?

1151
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,390
What's going on?

1152
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:05,250
- You killed her, didn't you?
- Who?

1153
01:27:05,274 --> 01:27:05,826
I knew it..

1154
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,526
Guys like you turn out
to be the serial killer.

1155
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:08,696
Are you crazy? What are
you talking about?

1156
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,616
- Prabha.
- What happened to her?

1157
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,430
How did you kill her?

1158
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,550
Did you strangle her?

1159
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:14,366
- Did you butcher her?
- No..

1160
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,150
I will tell everyone. I
will tell the Police.

1161
01:27:16,174 --> 01:27:17,026
I'll tell the boss.

1162
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:20,430
- Anand.. I swear I didn't even meet her.
- You are lying.

1163
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:22,600
- No, no, I..
- You're lying, dude.

1164
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:24,760
You know she was such a hottie.

1165
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,970
We could have..

1166
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:30,850
Hello.

1167
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,100
Yes.

1168
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,640
It's definitely soft.

1169
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:39,050
Yes, it's 3-ply technology.

1170
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,470
Dev, please come in.

1171
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,350
Meet Inspector Rawle.

1172
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,550
He's investigating
Prabha's murder case.

1173
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:49,930
Inspector Rawle, this is
Dev, my right-hand man.

1174
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,220
Did you know Prabha?

1175
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:56,616
I mean..I didn't know her well.

1176
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,640
She joined a few days back.

1177
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,640
So you guys were not close?

1178
01:28:00,946 --> 01:28:01,946
What...?

1179
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:03,430
I mean, you two
didn't talk much.

1180
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:08,680
No..Anand introduced
me to her once.

1181
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,680
- Anand who?
- We are colleagues.

1182
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,550
Was he Prabha's friend?

1183
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,050
They were..

1184
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:21,260
Actually, he's my friend
but he liked her.

1185
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,640
I see..

1186
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:24,220
And Prabha?

1187
01:28:27,406 --> 01:28:28,406
I don't know..

1188
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:32,390
He just told me that they
went on a date once.

1189
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,760
Did anything happen that night?

1190
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:38,526
How would I know, sir?

1191
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:41,260
All he said was that
she's a virgin.

1192
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:42,430
Virgin!

1193
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:48,300
- Send Anand inside.
- Yes, sir.

1194
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,010
Anand..come inside.

1195
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:52,390
Yes sir.

1196
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:56,390
Yes sir.

1197
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,970
- Anand..
- Yes sir i'm coming.

1198
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,220
- Anand, they are calling you inside.
- I know.

1199
01:29:01,276 --> 01:29:02,276
If anyone asks you..

1200
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,620
Then please don't tell anyone
that you gave me her address.

1201
01:29:04,644 --> 01:29:06,124
Why not? I will tell
them everything.

1202
01:29:06,148 --> 01:29:08,220
What are you saying? Why
will you tell them that?

1203
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,946
Why shouldn't I?

1204
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:11,220
- Then I'll be in trouble.
- It's good then.

1205
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,156
- Aren't we friends?
- I don't have a friend..

1206
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,850
Listen.. What are you saying?

1207
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:18,640
You should've thought
this before killing her.

1208
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:21,300
I swear I didn't do anything.

1209
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:23,600
Fine, I won't tell anyone.

1210
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,390
But I want Prabha's share now.

1211
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,406
- You want money?
- Yeah..

1212
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,180
- Aren't you my friend?
- I am no friend.

1213
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:32,590
Are you going to pay up or not?

1214
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:36,050
- Will you pay me or not?
- I will give you the money.

1215
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,260
Okay.

1216
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:38,800
I will give you the money.

1217
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,961
- Which car did you take on your date?
- My car of course.

1218
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:00,010
Where's the key?

1219
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,890
- There's the key, sir.
- Come on.

1220
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,800
- But why, sir..
- Give me the keys.

1221
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,450
- I haven't done anything..
- Hurry up.

1222
01:31:05,474 --> 01:31:07,434
I said hurry up.

1223
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:16,616
Honestly sir, we only
went on one date.

1224
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,866
What can I do? Nothing
happened that day.

1225
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,490
- And the next day..
- Which is your car?

1226
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,220
This one.

1227
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:20,970
Open it.

1228
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,260
- Sir, there's nothing in the car.
- I said open it.

1229
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:25,850
- Check it.
- Yes sir.

1230
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:30,656
- Open the trunk.
- I don't keep anything..

1231
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,970
I said open the trunk.

1232
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,900
- Take a look.
- There's nothing in here, sir.

1233
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:37,180
Did you find anything?
See for yourself.

1234
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,050
You won't find anything.

1235
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,240
- Take him in.
- No, sir. That's not mine.

1236
01:31:51,264 --> 01:31:53,434
- How dare you kill a virgin girl?
- No sir..

1237
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,640
Hello.

1238
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:29,640
Dev Kaushal.

1239
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,760
You are a busy man.

1240
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:34,550
Who?

1241
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,390
You don't know Chawla.

1242
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:41,050
But Chawla knows
everything about you.

1243
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:43,720
Chawla who? Manoj Chawla?

1244
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:45,850
Just Chawla.

1245
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,720
Yes tell me.

1246
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,550
Chawla wants to meet.

1247
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:52,050
Whom?

1248
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:53,850
You of course.

1249
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:55,550
But why?

1250
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,350
You're the Blackmailer.

1251
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:02,470
When and where that Chawla
will text you. Okay.

1252
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:03,890
Be there on time.

1253
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:05,890
You know time is money.

1254
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:28,550
So you're trying to say that Dev
is blackmailing his wife's lover.

1255
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,510
And he told you this.

1256
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:33,300
And you told Prabha.

1257
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:36,526
Then Prabha started
blackmailing him.

1258
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:37,640
Yes, sir..

1259
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:40,850
Which is why he killed Prabha.

1260
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:47,776
This sounds like a story
of some B-grade film.

1261
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:48,970
You Virgin Killer.

1262
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,390
- I swear, I..
- Hey.

1263
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:53,470
Don't try to impress our
sir by talking in Marathi.

1264
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:55,390
I swear, sir.

1265
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,890
The night Prabha was killed..

1266
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,390
Dev asked me for her address.

1267
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,550
I gave it to him myself.

1268
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:10,680
What is the name of
his wife's lover?

1269
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:13,430
He didn't tell me that.

1270
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,720
Move..

1271
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:23,140
Do you guys ever study?

1272
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:25,430
Why do always get beaten up?
Stop drinking.

1273
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:28,100
How are you?

1274
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:32,350
Go on.

1275
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:33,930
I said go.

1276
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,510
Have you decided which
one you want to buy?

1277
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,430
Which one will you recommend?

1278
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,890
"You must be really
happy today."

1279
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,680
Glock 210..Austria.

1280
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,510
Mr. Bachchan used it
in the film 'Deewar'.

1281
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,260
200,000 only.

1282
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,680
What's your name Basanti?

1283
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:22,510
Sholay.

1284
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:26,550
The Colt 1851..American.

1285
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,576
Mr. Bachchan used
this to kill Sambha.

1286
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,600
150,000 only.

1287
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:38,510
Honor. Tradition! Discipline.

1288
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,390
Are the three
pillars of Gurukul!

1289
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:43,350
Makarov..Russian.

1290
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:44,510
Mohabbatein.

1291
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:46,430
Mohabbatein.

1292
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,390
But there was no gun
in Mohabbatein.

1293
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:49,950
It was in the drawer,
no one saw it.

1294
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:51,300
100,000 only.

1295
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:55,720
What the..

1296
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:56,930
Here..

1297
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:59,760
Yadav Brothers, Amroha, India.

1298
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,470
A locally made Pistol.

1299
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,720
6,999..with 6 bullets free.

1300
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:08,026
- Used in the film Kaalia, by..
- Mr. Bachchan.

1301
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:11,300
- No.. Kaalia starring Mithun.
- Mithun?

1302
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:12,600
Its perfect for you.

1303
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:14,510
Is it working?

1304
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:17,220
You must aim 1.5
inches to the left..

1305
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:18,640
And it will hit its mark.

1306
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,640
Little more.

1307
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,760
Good..that's better.

1308
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:29,100
The countdown has begun.

1309
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,930
The day after tomorrow, when
we launch our product..

1310
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:35,930
Indians will enter a new
phase of evolution.

1311
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:38,760
I know you all have worked
very hard for this..

1312
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:43,890
And, I don't want you
to lose your focus..

1313
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:47,350
Dev!

1314
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,640
Yes, sir.

1315
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:52,350
Dev..Dev, my friend.

1316
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:56,510
I know, Prabha being a
virgin, her murder..

1317
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,350
And Anand being accused of it.

1318
01:36:58,470 --> 01:37:00,050
It's just too much for you.

1319
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,946
I mean, I am shocked too.

1320
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:04,600
- Anand stole my wife's photo.
- Yes, sir.

1321
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,100
- Shameful.
- Yes, sir.

1322
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:09,220
But we can't get
distracted right now.

1323
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,220
No, sir.

1324
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,550
- Especially you.
- Yes, sir.

1325
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:15,140
We need you.

1326
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:17,050
I need you!

1327
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:24,406
And..now for the good news.

1328
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:25,430
Pandey.

1329
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:28,510
Tomorrow, at exactly
22:00 hours..

1330
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,510
The Municipality will turn off
the water supply in this area.

1331
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:36,576
All our distributors,
direct sales agents..

1332
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,930
Should be in every nook
and corner of this area.

1333
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:43,550
The day after tomorrow people
must go to the toilet with a..

1334
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:47,776
'My Handy' toilet paper,
instead of the newspaper.

1335
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,260
- Understand.
- Yes, sir.

1336
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:51,986
- I don't hear you.
- Yes, sir!

1337
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:53,010
Yes, sir!

1338
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,800
Okay..let's get back to work.

1339
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,050
Nice perfume.

1340
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,600
Who are you meeting?

1341
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:19,350
My business partner.

1342
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:21,760
What did you say his name was?

1343
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:29,220
Edward..

1344
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,600
Edward!

1345
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,800
But you said it's Dev.

1346
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,430
Exactly..

1347
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:41,930
Dev Edward.

1348
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,470
He's a mixed Catholic.

1349
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,800
There are like him.
Didn't I tell you?

1350
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:50,470
Well, Dolly, I am getting late.
See you.

1351
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:54,010
Bye, good day.

1352
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,890
Where were you the night
Prabha got murdered?

1353
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,930
Right here in the office.

1354
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:09,260
- Do you stay in the office very late?
- Yes.

1355
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,600
Yeah..

1356
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:13,410
When the wife's
having an affair..

1357
01:39:13,434 --> 01:39:15,104
What's the point in
going home early?

1358
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:16,390
What?

1359
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,800
Your wife's having an
affair, isn't she?

1360
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,720
No.

1361
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,800
Says who?

1362
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:22,930
Forget it.

1363
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,260
But, aren't you blackmailing
your wife's lover?

1364
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:30,720
No..no, she doesn't
have a lover.

1365
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:32,350
I see..

1366
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:35,680
So you didn't tell
Anand anything?

1367
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,300
No.

1368
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:40,390
And Anand didn't tell
Prabha anything either?

1369
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,600
No.

1370
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,350
So Prabha was blackmailing you?

1371
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:44,140
No.

1372
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:45,990
Then why did you ask
for Prabha's address?

1373
01:39:46,014 --> 01:39:47,014
That was because..

1374
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:49,010
- I was..
- You're trapped.

1375
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,140
You're trapped. Trapped..

1376
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:57,010
Well..I'll arrest you
in a couple of days.

1377
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,140
Don't try to run!

1378
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,140
Bye.

1379
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,510
Ranjit, where the hell were you?

1380
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:50,390
Give me your hand.

1381
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,550
Feel how firm it is.

1382
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,010
Why do you have a gun?

1383
01:40:57,470 --> 01:40:59,470
To shoot the blackmailer.

1384
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:07,470
Have you lost your mind?

1385
01:41:08,026 --> 01:41:09,866
Are you going to murder
him to hide our affair?

1386
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:11,550
Don't talk like my wife.

1387
01:41:12,466 --> 01:41:14,986
I told you to hire a private
detective to find the blackmailer..

1388
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:16,330
But you couldn't even do that.

1389
01:41:16,354 --> 01:41:17,354
And you have a gun.

1390
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,600
Found him.

1391
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:20,470
Who?

1392
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,010
Private Detective.

1393
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:24,180
He's the one who got me this.

1394
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:25,970
- What?
- Gun, what else?

1395
01:41:26,430 --> 01:41:28,390
Hey dude, will you let me
watch the movie or not?

1396
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,600
Look ahead.

1397
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:34,930
Is he any good?

1398
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:36,930
Read the third line.

1399
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:41,260
- 97% success rate..
- 97% success rate!

1400
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,300
He said he'll do it.

1401
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:48,720
But, it will take some time.

1402
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:52,260
Time? And, what do
we do until then?

1403
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:57,140
He said we should keep paying
the blackmailer for now.

1404
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:58,970
But how?

1405
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:00,866
I don't have any more money.

1406
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:02,260
Why don't you get it?

1407
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:05,680
I don't have any more money. I
can't ask Dev for more money.

1408
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,760
I am there.

1409
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:57,140
Why did you..

1410
01:42:59,430 --> 01:43:01,550
I won't spare you.

1411
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,656
Where are you going?

1412
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,390
Have you lost your mind, Anand?

1413
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:08,890
That will hurt.

1414
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,140
I will break your head.

1415
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:13,640
I will break your legs.

1416
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:17,350
Dev!

1417
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:26,260
That will hurt. That will hurt.

1418
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,776
I'll tell Everyone.
You're a murderer.

1419
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,470
- That will hurt.
- You're a murderer.

1420
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:35,720
I will tell Reena.
You're a murderer.

1421
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:39,050
Now my turn.

1422
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:45,350
- Don't..
- You took my job, my reputation..

1423
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:46,526
Even the girl.

1424
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:47,930
You tricked me.

1425
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:52,486
I purposely tricked you.

1426
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:56,260
Do you know why? Because I
have a million dollar plan.

1427
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,970
No-no..

1428
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,140
First, you killed Prabha
and then you tricked me.

1429
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,326
Now you're tempting
me with money.

1430
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,470
Are you tempted?

1431
01:44:06,696 --> 01:44:07,696
Yes.

1432
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,010
Good-good..

1433
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:11,890
Now listen to me.
Throw that away.

1434
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,890
- No-no-no..
- Fine, I am throwing this away first.

1435
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:18,260
Throw it away.

1436
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:19,890
Throw it away.

1437
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,220
I didn't kill Prabha.

1438
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,776
But, I had to trick you..

1439
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,140
Otherwise I would've
been a suspect.

1440
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,100
And if they had doubted me then
we would've lost millions.

1441
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:39,600
And I knew that you will
anyhow get out of this.

1442
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,890
Now..let my plan be completed.

1443
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:46,720
What is the plan?

1444
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:49,550
It's in the making.

1445
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,970
You are trying to fool me.

1446
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:54,890
Honestly.

1447
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:57,220
I promise.

1448
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:59,220
Will I lie?

1449
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:03,776
Look, buddy, if you try
to trick me again..

1450
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,010
I'll expose you completely.

1451
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,430
Smile properly.

1452
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:20,510
You've really grown up.
Where is your dad?

1453
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:22,720
Milind..she's really
grown up now.

1454
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:24,140
No.. You take one.

1455
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:26,656
Whose wedding is it?

1456
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:29,350
He is Chawla's client's nephew.

1457
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:31,550
So what now?

1458
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:33,390
You say.

1459
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,140
No, you say.

1460
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:39,550
10..

1461
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:41,390
10,000

1462
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,600
Are you buying a
washing machine?

1463
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:46,100
Chawla will need 50,000.

1464
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:50,140
50,000 is out of the question.
That's too much.

1465
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,946
- Do you have 100 rupees?
- What?

1466
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:53,100
100 rupees.

1467
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:55,260
- 100 rupees?
- Yes.

1468
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:56,850
- Yes, I do.
- Give me.

1469
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,140
That makes it 101.

1470
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:08,510
An auspicious gift should
always consist of 101 Rs.

1471
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,930
Chawla knows everything.

1472
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:15,260
Chawla knows that
Ranjit has decided.

1473
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:18,760
- Decided what?
- To kill you.

1474
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,760
Completely.

1475
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,220
Uncle, we're up next.

1476
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:25,390
Come on.

1477
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:27,930
You're looking really
handsome, son.

1478
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:30,220
When he was small, he
used to pee on me.

1479
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:31,116
Congratulations.

1480
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:32,140
Come on.

1481
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,800
He's family. Say hello to him.

1482
01:46:33,824 --> 01:46:34,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

1483
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:36,720
I'll need some time.

1484
01:46:36,906 --> 01:46:38,906
We'll discuss it later.
First, let's get a picture.

1485
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:39,616
Sir one photo please.

1486
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:40,640
Take a picture.

1487
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,600
Chawla has a big heart.

1488
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:45,100
You'll get 24 hours.

1489
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:47,720
Where is Chawla?

1490
01:46:53,176 --> 01:46:54,576
Do you want to chop
something, mam?

1491
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:55,760
I will do it.

1492
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:58,550
No..

1493
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,220
I will chop this one on my own.

1494
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:05,430
Go home..

1495
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:11,300
And, send Monu and the
security guard too.

1496
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,720
Yes, Mam.

1497
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:15,180
Listen..

1498
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:18,470
Turn the lights off.

1499
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:29,680
Malti.

1500
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:32,680
Monu.

1501
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:36,350
Monu..

1502
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:42,890
Dolly.

1503
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,680
Dolly, are you out of your mind?

1504
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:09,550
- Dolly leave me.
- I won't.

1505
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,260
I won't spare you.

1506
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:13,970
I'll kill you!

1507
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:21,010
I'll kill you!

1508
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:30,220
Dolly?

1509
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:33,510
Dolly?

1510
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,720
Dolly?

1511
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:40,970

She was doing yoga, but
I guess she overdid it.

Yeah..

Hello.

1542
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:57,116
Bloody Chawla..

1543
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:59,220
Or Chawla's assistant,
or whoever you are.

1544
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:01,180
What the hell are you doing?

1545
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:03,850
Where's the information
on my blackmailer?

1546
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:06,970
Oh yeah..Chawla was
about to call you.

1547
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:09,350
- Did you find him?
- No.

1548
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:12,260
Then why were you
going to call me?

1549
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,720
Just to say hello.

1550
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:17,470
- Say hello?
- Yeah..

1551
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,050

1552

Are you my friend who would
call me up just to say Hello?

1553
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:23,390
Find the bloody blackmailer.

1554
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:25,760
Or else, I still have
three bullets left.

1555
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:28,010
Hello..don't get
angry like this..

1556
01:54:29,850 --> 01:54:30,850
He hung up.

1557
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:38,760

- What? Let me sleep.

1558
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:42,350

- Yeah, so what.

And threatening me and
you don't seem to care.

1561
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:48,526
It's nothing..

1562
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:50,720
You should think before
showing compassion.

1563
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:52,260

01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:05,326
Papa has a surgery next week.

1567
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:06,760
I need 60,000.

1568
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:09,050
Do you think I won some
kind of a jackpot?

1569
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:12,010
What should I do?
Let my father die?

1570
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:13,550
Dev..

1571
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:18,800
You can do whatever you want.

1572
01:56:38,276 --> 01:56:39,276
Hello.

1573
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,100
Hello, mom. How are you?

1574
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:43,100
Son, we don't have any money.

1575
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:48,180
Reena told me, but you must have
something in case of an emergency.

1576
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:49,760
Don't do this, son.

1577
01:56:49,970 --> 01:56:51,890
We've only enough to
buy his medicines.

1578
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:53,510
I see..

1579
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:55,866
You were never so
money-minded, Dev.

1580
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:56,986
Have some pity on us.

1581
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:59,470
No, mom, it's not what you think.
But..

1582
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:03,350
Fine, I'll try..

1583
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:05,470
When is the surgery?

1584
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:07,156
Whose surgery?

1585
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:09,050
Dad's surgery... Dad.

1586
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,300
But he doesn't have a surgery.

1587
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:16,390
Then what about those expensive
tests you did last week?

1588
01:57:16,850 --> 01:57:18,760
That wasn't last week.

1589
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:21,390
We got it done before
Rinku's son's wedding.

1590
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:22,930
Almost 3 months ago.

1591
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,180
Hello..

1592
01:57:25,390 --> 01:57:26,390
Hello..

1593
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:30,140
What are you doing, wait..

1594
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:16,550
Answer the phone.

1595
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,300
Answer the phone.

1596
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:42,180
Hello.

1597
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:44,720
Dev. Where the hell..

1598
01:58:45,156 --> 01:58:46,156
Where are you?

1599
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:48,890
- Sir, I had a personal appointment..
- I don't give a..

1600
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:51,930
You get down here right now if
you know what's good for you.

1601
01:58:52,050 --> 01:58:53,140
I'll be there, sir.

1602
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,300
No just..

1603
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:56,510
Dev. Dev!

1604
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,720
"Revenge."

1605
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:23,130
She isn't answering her phone.

1606
02:03:23,550 --> 02:03:24,550
But it's ringing.

1607
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,680
Sonu.

1608
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:36,850
Sonu.

1609
02:03:38,446 --> 02:03:39,446
Hello.

1610
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:40,470
Yes tell me.

1611
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:43,550
Where are you, dude? We were
supposed to meet today.

1612
02:03:43,574 --> 02:03:45,704
Listen-Listen-Listen..
Are you at home tonight?

1613
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,446
Stay at home, I am coming over.

1614
02:03:47,470 --> 02:03:50,640
- And, what about the plan?
- It's ready.

1615
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:54,760
Fine, come soon. I
am waiting for you.

1616
02:03:58,430 --> 02:03:59,470
50,000.

1617
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:01,510
Chawla will count.

1618
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:03,390
Why count? It's all there.

1619
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:04,970
Chawla will still count.

1620
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:08,430
I need a favor.

1621
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:27,970
- Has the detective given any information?
- No.

1622
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:30,600
If he doesn't give any
information by tonight..

1623
02:04:30,624 --> 02:04:32,874
- I am calling the cops.
- No..not cops.

1624
02:04:39,470 --> 02:04:41,970
- Yeah, Chawla.
- You're really lucky.

1625
02:04:42,470 --> 02:04:45,446
Chawla has found the name
of your blackmailer.

1626
02:04:45,470 --> 02:04:46,470
You found.

1627
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:48,970
Who is he?

1628
02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:36,640
"The world can't sc♪♪♪ someone,
who's already screwing himself."

1629
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:41,180
"who's already scr♪♪♪♪ himself."

1630
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:48,260
"Without even having
to try too hard."

1631
02:05:56,140 --> 02:06:00,300
"O crazy heart better
brace yourself."

1632
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:05,140
"You must know how to
pleasure yourself."

1633
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:09,180
"Don't think twice and,
just do-do-do it.."

1634
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:11,760
"Just do this sin...!"

1635
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:21,720
"Just do this sin...!"

1636
02:06:28,736 --> 02:06:29,736
Who are you?

1637
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:30,760
I need a favor.

1638
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:34,720
Call him up and give him a name.

1639
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:36,800
- Anand Tripathi?
- Yes.

1640
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:41,220
Sonia!

1641
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:29,720
Dolly.

1642
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:33,370
- Look there.
- No, she is not there.

1643
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:51,680
Dolly.

1644
02:08:52,776 --> 02:08:53,776
Dolly.

1645
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:54,930
Are you in there?

1646
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,140
Dolly..

1647
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:59,050
Mom.

1648
02:08:59,180 --> 02:08:59,850
Blood?

1649
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:01,446
No-No-No, this isn't Dolly's.

1650
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:02,406
- Dolly.
- No..

1651
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:04,406
- He killed Dolly.
- No..no..

1652
02:09:04,430 --> 02:09:07,100
- You killed her.
- No, I didn't do anything..

1653
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:09,350
He killed Dolly.

1654
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:13,430
Please.. please.. listen to me.

1655
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:18,140
I didn't do it.

1656
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:19,350
Text: When are you coming home?

1657
02:10:46,430 --> 02:10:48,736
"I swear I'm going
to make you pay."

1658
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:51,776
"I loved you so much
but you never cared."

1659
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:54,826
"I know it tastes bitter but
it's the most effective."

1660
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:56,866
"We're no longer one soul."

1661
02:10:56,890 --> 02:10:59,736
"No more running behind you I'm going
to get everything back you stole."

1662
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:01,960
"Love maybe lost and there's
just darkness in my heart."

1663
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:14,180
"Revenge."

1664
02:11:26,470 --> 02:11:27,600
"Revenge."

1665
02:11:45,016 --> 02:11:47,736
The sudden cut-off in the water
supply by the Municipal Corporation..

1666
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:49,640
Created a chaos amongst
citizens for a while.

1667
02:11:49,664 --> 02:11:51,800
But the situation
is under control.

1668
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:55,350
As people opted to start their
day with Jet Mineral Water.

1669
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:57,051
The sales of Jet Mineral Water
has shot up unexpectedly...

1670
02:11:57,063 --> 02:11:58,486
What?

1671
02:11:58,510 --> 02:11:59,406
No.

1672
02:11:59,418 --> 02:12:00,326
Experts consider this a brilliant
marketing strategy by jet mineral water.

1673
02:12:00,350 --> 02:12:02,430
That's.. That's my strategy.

1674
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:06,300
Get off.

1675
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:10,470
