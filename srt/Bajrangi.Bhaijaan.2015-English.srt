1
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,230
The fielder's running after the ball...
but the ball's already across the boundary line.

2
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,690
This has happened often.

3
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,270
If Pakistan wants to win the match then they
don't have a better batsman than Afridi.

4
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Shahid Afridi will
have to take charge here.

5
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,770
No one can doubt his ability.

6
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,270
But today is his opportunity
to show the world..

7
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,270
Yes...the game can change any moment.

8
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,150
Slow ball and Afridi has hit it...

9
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,520
Excellent shot...
and the ball's across the boundary.

10
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,770
And that's a four.

11
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,110
Bravo

12
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,770
Looks like your son is really eager.

13
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,400
Pakistan needs four more balls to win.

14
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,110
Have you thought of a name?

15
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,770
Shahid!

16
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,270
Why are you laughing?

17
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,270
What if it's a girl?

18
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,520
Girl?
- Hmmmm

19
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,900
Last ball...and Shahid
Afridi has swung his bat.

20
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,150
Congratulations.

21
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,270
What is your name?

22
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,770
It's Shahida.

23
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,650
Shahida! What a cute name?

24
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,770
Where are you from?

25
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,270
You will only talk
to your mother not me?

26
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,610
No...it's not that.

27
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,270
She doesn't talk to her mother either.

28
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,650
Why?

29
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,150
Shahida, it'll be dark soon.

30
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,270
Go home.
I'll bring your kids home

31
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,150
Rauf.

32
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,360
Rauf, where's Shahida?

33
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,360
She hasn't returned home yet?
- No, she hasn't.

34
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,520
Shahida!

35
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,860
Shahida!
- Shahida!

36
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,020
Shahida!

37
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,020
Shahida!

38
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,980
Shahida!

39
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,150
Rauf!

40
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,270
Rauf! Shahida!

41
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,520
Rauf!
- Shahida?

42
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,270
Shahida, Rauf
- Wait.

43
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,230
Rauf! Shahida!
- Just wait.

44
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,310
Since when have I been
telling you to take her

45
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,400
...to Delhi's Hazrat
Nizamuddin Auliya's shrine.

46
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,480
Even the mute start talking there.

47
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,980
I was five and hadn't spoken a word.

48
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,940
And I was taken there.

49
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,900
And you began to speak?

50
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,020
Would you like to
hear me say something?

51
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,020
But Delhi's in India now.

52
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,270
So what?

53
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,310
It's not in America, is it?

54
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,270
It's easier to go to America, father.

55
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,270
It was different earlier,
it was the same country.

56
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,650
And you're forgetting that
I served in the army for 5 years.

57
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,770
The Indians won't give me a visa.

58
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,360
I will take her.

59
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,520
At any cost..

60
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,770
I'll do anything so that
my girl can speak, go to school.

61
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,360
I have decided.

62
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,770
I will take Shahida to Delhi.

63
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:21,900
"There are many aspects
of the benevolent Lord."

64
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,520
"He who is blessed by His grace.."

65
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,520
"..fortune too smiles on him."

66
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,150
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

67
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,480
"Have mercy on me."

68
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,810
"The Benevolent one
is my only refuge."

69
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,400
Shahida Rauf

70
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,110
Yes.

71
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,230
"Nizamuddin Auliya!"

72
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,230
"Nizamuddin Auliya!"

73
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,230
"Bless me with your grace."

74
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,770
No prayers have ever gone unanswered..

75
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,900
...from Memboob-e-llahi's threshold.

76
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,690
Just see.

77
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,770
Your daughter will chirp like a bird..

78
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,980
...as soon as she gets to Pakistan.

79
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,110
God willing.

80
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,770
God willing

81
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,560
Why has the train stopped?

82
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,150
It's nothing, Ma'am

83
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,650
The tracks ahead
are undergoing repairs.

84
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,770
It'll be fixed soon, don't worry.

85
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,860
Go to sleep!

86
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,650
Fine, let's all sleep.

87
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,400
Shahida.

88
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,020
Shahida.

89
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,900
Shahida!

90
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,270
Shahida!

91
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,980
Shahida!

92
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,060
Shahida!

93
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,020
What happened?

94
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,980
I can't find my daughter.
Shahida!

95
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,270
Shahida!

96
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,730
Shahida!

97
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,900
Shahida!

98
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,110
Shahida!

99
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,900
Pull the chain!

100
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,230
Pull the chain!

101
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,150
The Indians are saying
they didn't find your daughter.

102
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,360
But they will look
again in the morning.

103
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,650
Sir, please listen to me.

104
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,270
It's just five minutes away.

105
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,400
Please let me go,
I will look for her myself...

106
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,900
It maybe 5 minutes away,
but it's across the border.

107
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,270
In a different country.

108
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,900
So what if it's a different country?

109
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,770
I want my daughter back.

110
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,230
Try to understand ma'am,
you'll need a fresh visa to go back.

111
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,400
Be patient,
your child will be found.

112
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,110
How?

113
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,480
You don't get it.

114
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,980
My child can't speak.

115
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,650
She's absolutely alone
in an unfamiliar country.

116
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,900
You all can do nothing.

117
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
I will find Shahida myself.

118
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,150
Stop her.
- Shahida!

119
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,230
Shahida!

120
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,150
Shahida!

121
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,900
Shahida!

122
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,480
Calm down! Have faith in God.

123
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,650
Calm down, dear.

124
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,020
There must be some god-sent in India.

125
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,980
...who will look after our Shahida.

126
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,770
Calm down.

127
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,440
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

128
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,810
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

129
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,310
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

130
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,690
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

131
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,270
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

132
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,560
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

133
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,770
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

134
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,520
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

135
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,900
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

136
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,400
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

137
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,060
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

138
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,400
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

139
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,020
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

140
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,770
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

141
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,940
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

142
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,400
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

143
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,810
"Ram Lakhan Janki.."

144
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,360
"Glory to Lord Hanuman."

145
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,690
"Glory to Bajrang Bali."

146
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,400
"Break the bones of the enemy."

147
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,440
"Glory to Bajrang Bali."

148
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,980
"Break the bones of the enemy."

149
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,270
"Glory to Bajrang Bali."

150
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,060
"Break the bones of the enemy."

151
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,770
"The drums are echoing hard."

152
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,810
"Whether it's London or Lanka."

153
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,520
"It's resonating all around,."

154
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,400
"Glory to Thee."

155
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,690
"The drums are echoing hard."

156
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,810
"Whether it's London or Lanka."

157
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,900
"It's resonating all around,."

158
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,270
"With Your blessings
conferred on us."

159
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,020
"We've no fears or apprehensions."

160
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,770
"We'll dance up a storm."

161
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,270
"When He works His miracle."

162
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,400
"You'll know the difference."

163
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,650
"Come and take learn
this mantra from me."

164
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,900
"Come and take it."

165
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:20,400
"Come and take it."

166
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,150
"Give a hug to anyone
you come across."

167
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,480
"Come and take it."

168
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,270
"Let's take a dip in the sea of fun."

169
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,860
"Come and take it."

170
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,900
"Now let's take a selfie."

171
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,230
"Now let's take a selfie."

172
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,650
"Now let's take a selfie."

173
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,650
"I'm a simple guy,
with no crooked ways."

174
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,520
"You won't find anyone like me,
on the moon or on China".

175
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,270
"I always did what my heart said.."

176
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,270
"..but never broke anyone's heart."

177
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,650
"Always immersed in the
devotion of Lord Hanuman."

178
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,810
"I never make tall claims."

179
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,270
"I never brag either."

180
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,020
"I am happy in my own world,
everyone watches me."

181
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,900
"I am always immersed in
the thoughts of Bajrang Bali."

182
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,520
"I've a big heart like
Lord Hanuman's mace."

183
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,230
"Just like you'll find Lord
Ram residing in Hanuman's heart."

184
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,150
"You will always find
Lord Hanuman in my heart."

185
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,400
"You're my drama, you're my cinema."

186
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,770
"if You're with me."

187
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,770
"You're my earning, and my policy."

188
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,400
"Since you're with me."

189
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,020
"No boundaries can ever stop me."

190
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,980
"if You're with me."

191
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,400
"if You're with me."

192
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,150
"My elated heart says..."

193
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,520
"Feel the waves of fun."

194
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,520
"Again.."

195
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,770
"Come and take it."

196
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,650
"Come and take it."

197
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,610
"One, two, three.."

198
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,020
<i>“Louder?</i>

199
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:31,150
"Come and take it."

200
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,310
"Give a hug to anyone
you come across."

201
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,770
"Come and take it."

202
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,400
"Let's take a dip in the sea of fun."

203
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,020
"Come and take it."

204
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,110
"Now let's take a selfie."

205
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,400
"Now let's take a selfie."

206
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,060
"Glory to Bajrang Bali."

207
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,020
"Break the bones of the enemy."

208
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,770
"Glory to Bajrang Bali."

209
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,940
"Break the bones of the enemy."

210
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,270
"Glory to Bajrang Bali."

211
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,400
"Break the bones of the enemy."

212
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,900
"Glory to Bajrang Bali."

213
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,480
"Break the bones of the enemy."
- "Now let's take a selfie."

214
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,400
Brother, what's a selfie?

215
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,230
When you take your own'... picture

216
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,150
That's a selfie.

217
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,270
Brother, you were dancing like a star.

218
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,650
I always get immersed
in the devotion of Bajrang Bali.

219
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,020
Yes, brother.

220
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,520
Please get bread for the kid.

221
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,770
Yes, brother.

222
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,520
But she's asking for two.

223
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,900
You must have a name.

224
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,560
Sita-Gita.

225
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,810
Payal-Puja.

226
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,020
Brother, I think she's deaf.

227
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,520
She heard me order the bread?

228
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,860
Yes, that's true.

229
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,150
Let me ask.

230
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,650
Name?

231
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,810
She's illiterate.

232
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,400
Why don't you write
it in Sanskrit instead?

233
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,900
She's a 5 year old kid.

234
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,150
Eat all you want.

235
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,150
Why are you following me again?

236
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,360
Oh...

237
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,650
...here you are.

238
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,150
Did you get separated
from your parents?

239
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,270
Say something.

240
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,110
What is this mess?

241
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,730
Now you're under
Bajrang Bali's refuge.

242
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,230
This is a miraculous temple.

243
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,860
Your parents must be looking for you,
just like you are looking for them.

244
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,270
They will come here.

245
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,270
Just join your hands...and sit here.

246
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,150
Like this.

247
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,270
And I...

248
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,020
I'll be seeing you.

249
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,610
If it takes them longer,
then eat that apple.

250
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,730
Don't stay hungry.

251
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,900
Come on.

252
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,520
Come on.

253
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,770
Stop the bus!

254
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,900
No, no, no, no!

255
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,230
You can't leave this child here.
- Why not?

256
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,110
Her parents will come here
to file a complaint, right?

257
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,150
And what if they don't?

258
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,020
If they don't? Why?

259
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,520
Why not?

260
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,020
Look at her face.

261
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,400
That's fine, but still..

262
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,360
...you can't leave her here.
- Why not?

263
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,270
Look at her face.

264
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,270
And now see their faces.

265
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,650
Criminals,
thieves, drunkards, pickpockets.

266
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,650
And this is a Police Station,
not an orphanage.

267
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,440
But.. - Well, write down
your details on this.

268
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,400
If I find out anything about this kid,
I will call you up personally.

269
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,770
And till then?

270
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,270
Till then...

271
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Hail Lord Ram!

272
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,230
Hail Lord Ram?

273
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,610
This isn't your home?

274
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,150
Where is it?

275
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,230
Must be somewhere.

276
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,480
I know, I'll tell you names of cities.

277
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,310
And if your home is
any one of these places..

278
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,190
...then just raise your hand.

279
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,400
How?

280
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,520
Okay.

281
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,900
Delhi.

282
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,520
Meerut.

283
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,650
Faridabad.

284
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,400
Gwalior.

285
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,060
Jhansi. Patiala.
Amritsar. Jodhpur. Jaipur.

286
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,900
Srinagar, Pathankot, Shimla, Ambala.

287
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,900
Baroda?

288
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,400
Rampur?

289
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,150
Is it Dehradoon?

290
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,770
Kasauli?

291
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,400
Pratapgarh.

292
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,900
Are you from Pratapgarh?
- Yes.

293
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,520
Me too.
- Really?

294
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,060
Swear on Bajrang Bali.

295
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,190
I live next to Neeli Phatak.

296
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,770
That's where my in-law's home is.

297
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,770
That makes us relatives.

298
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,150
These days I am staying in Delhi.

299
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,020
Why Delhi?

300
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,270
Job...or girl?

301
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,020
It's a long story.

302
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,610
Tell us, It's not like
we are waiting to catch a bus.

303
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,020
Yeah, tell us.

304
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,270
Tell us.

305
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,060
You don't say anything?

306
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,360
Would you like to hear our story?

307
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,770
I am Pawan.

308
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,480
Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.

309
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,980
But everyone calls me Bajrangi.

310
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,520
You can call me brother..

311
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,230
How old are you?

312
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,400
Six!

313
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,520
Then you call me uncle.

314
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,150
Uncle will be right.

315
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,020
My father, Diwakar Chaturvedi..

316
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,900
...was the postmaster in Pratapgarh.

317
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,230
"Come and take it."

318
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,190
His name justified his qualities.

319
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,690
My father knew all the four Vedas.

320
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,520
But I couldn't even
remember the 4 times tables.

321
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,270
Four eights are..

322
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,020
Twenty Two.

323
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,480
No!
Twenty-five.

324
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,940
No, twenty-seven.

325
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,190
Twenty-eight...Thirty.

326
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,900
Father!

327
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,400
For father, physical health
was as important as mental wellness.

328
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,650
Bravo. Come on.

329
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
Scholar plus Wrestler. Wow!

330
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,400
But I failed in that too.

331
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,020
Hold him.

332
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,150
Stop laughing. Pawan.

333
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,770
Forget it. You will never learn.

334
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,560
You can never do anything.

335
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,520
How can I help it
if I feel ticklish while wrestling!

336
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,770
But this glory wasn't enough for
Mr. Chaturvedi.

337
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,520
My father was also the chief
of the Pratapgarh branch.

338
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,610
Neither education,
nor wrestling or politics.

339
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,770
I wasn't interested
in any of father's subjects.

340
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,150
That's why he gave me a special name.

341
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:17,770
What?

342
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,150
Zero!

343
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,230
What happened?

344
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,860
Fail!

345
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,810
It took me 20 years
to pass 10th High school.

346
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,020
Between High school and graduation..

347
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,770
...I failed 10 times.

348
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,810
By now father had also given up on me.

349
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,020
What happened?

350
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,520
Fail!

351
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,270
Did you pass?

352
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,150
Fail!

353
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,230
Fail!

354
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,270
Fail!

355
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,400
Fail!

356
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Oh, God!

357
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,900
Fail!

358
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:03,150
My friends told me to cheat...but, I was
A devotee of Bajrang Bali after all

359
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,520
I said, I would rather
fail than cheat.

360
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,270
So I attempted the exams 11th time.

361
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,360
Welcome.

362
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,520
Welcome.

363
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,650
I am sure you've broken
your own record in failing.

364
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,150
Father... - When you have
already failed 10 times..

365
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,270
...why did you have to humiliate
me again, for the 11th time.

366
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,520
Why?

367
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,360
I've accepted that you're a fool,
that you're stupid and useless.

368
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,310
You're a zero.

369
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,480
Listen.
- What? Hear what?

370
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,860
You have failed 10 times.

371
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,400
And failed me 20 times.

372
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,020
Listen to me, father.
- What's left to hear or say anymore?

373
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,770
If you want to do something for me..

374
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,110
...then do me a favor and go away,
to Delhi.

375
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,400
I have heard that there is a dearth
of useless people in that city.

376
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,770
I have a friend there.

377
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,230
Dayanand.

378
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,520
He will get you a job some where

379
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,230
Father, I passed.

380
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,770
Wonderful.

381
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,150
What did your father say?

382
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,270
I am sure Mr. Chaturvedi
must be shocked.

383
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,900
I knew he would be shocked.

384
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,020
But I never thought he
would be so deeply shocked.

385
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,400
Why? What happened?

386
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,650
Father...

387
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,520
...I am going to Delhi.

388
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:41,360
And left for Delhi to
fulfill my father's last wish.

389
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,150
To see Dayanand.

390
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,150
"That's our brother Bajrangi."

391
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,610
Mister, I don't have change.

392
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,980
Give five rupees to madam.

393
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,520
Madam, please take 5 rupees from him.

394
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,150
Hail Lord Ram!

395
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,270
Do you have 5 rupees change,
so I can give you 10?

396
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,150
No, I don't.

397
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,360
What now?
- It's okay, you can keep it.

398
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,650
How can I do that?

399
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,480
I must give you 5 rupees.

400
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,730
Then give it to me.
- I can't do that either.

401
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,400
5 rupees are mine too

402
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,940
Look, mister.
It's okay. You can keep it.

403
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,270
I can't do that.

404
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,560
But of this, 5 rupees is yours.

405
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,770
Then give it to me.

406
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,360
But 5 rupees are mine too.

407
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,150
Sister! Sister!

408
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,980
Sister!

409
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,520
Sister!

410
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,480
Sister!

411
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,650
What?
- It's your money.

412
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,860
I don't want 5 rupees.

413
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,650
Take it please.

414
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,400
Then give it.

415
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,650
Took all of it?

416
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,020
Half of it is mine.

417
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,900
Do one thing,
get change from that stall.

418
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,150
Please give me change.

419
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,020
Hold on.

420
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,110
Come on.

421
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,020
Stand up.

422
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,400
Stand up.

423
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
Straight.

424
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,770
Come on. Come on.

425
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,150
Sir...break the arm-lock,
break the arm-lock.

426
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,480
What?

427
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,310
Up...up...up!

428
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,480
Up!

429
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,650
Wring his arm.

430
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,860
Wring it.

431
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,770
Wring it.

432
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,770
Pin him down!
Pin him down!

433
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,360
And one, two...three!

434
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,230
"Come and take it."

435
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,770
Hail Lord Ram!

436
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,400
My self...

437
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
You!

438
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,770
You! Here?

439
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,270
Are you following me?

440
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,230
No, madam, l..
- What?

441
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,770
I said I don't want the money.

442
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,520
Do you know him?

443
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,060
He was in the same bus as I.

444
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,190
Followed me all the way home.

445
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,810
Neither am I following anyone.

446
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,270
I swear on Bajrang Bali.

447
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,020
I am from Pratapgarh,
here to meet Mr. Dayanand.

448
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,060
Who are you?

449
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,440
Pawan Chaturvedi,
Mr. Chaturvedi's son.

450
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,860
Chaturvedi's son?
- Yes. Bajrangi!

451
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,400
Put him down.

452
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,400
Here you go.
- That's all.

453
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,770
Eat some more, it's our specialty.

454
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,650
We sprinkle salt while
boiling the potatoes.

455
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,020
That's why they are so good.

456
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,770
Please eat.

457
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,360
Is someone cooking meat?

458
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,110
It's the house next door.

459
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,310
They're Muslims.

460
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,810
Start cooking early in the morning.

461
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,230
In my manor,
that is the Harvansh Trivedi Manor..

462
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,650
...I made it clear, no rooms will
be given to people from other caste..

463
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,770
Brother...tell us what you do.

464
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,020
I've come to Delhi in search of work.

465
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,150
Can't he get some job in your school?

466
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,650
Wow, you too.

467
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,270
What?

468
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,400
You still study in school?

469
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,360
No, I teach there.

470
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,020
Go with Rasika tomorrow to her school.

471
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,770
She will definitely get you a job.

472
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,270
Yes.

473
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,520
Hail Bajrang Bali.

474
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,480
There are a lot of monkeys here.

475
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,480
Will you keep bowing to them all day?

476
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,020
Here.

477
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,520
Take this...Keep this under your
cot before you sleep.

478
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,770
Along with monkeys; you will
also find a lot of mosquitoes here.

479
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,230
Give me a minute

480
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,610
Give me your hands.

481
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,650
Excuse me.

482
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,020
Trust me.

483
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,900
Come on.

484
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,650
One, two, three, four, five.

485
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,900
And yes.

486
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,360
Please don't call me sister,
My name is Rasika!

487
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,900
Good morning, ma'am.

488
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,150
Hail Sri Ram.

489
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,270
Bajrang Bali.

490
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,400
Break the bones of the enemy.

491
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,020
Bajrang Bali.
Break the bones of the enemy.

492
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,360
"The heart's looking for sanctity."

493
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:23,650
"A wish that needs to be fulfilled."

494
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:32,360
"Something I never...
ever wished for."

495
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,520
"Why do I want it now?"

496
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:45,900
"The heart wants the
feeling of your existence."

497
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,110
"I want...you."

498
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,900
"I want...you."

499
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,020
"Day and night, all I want is you."

500
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,310
"I want you."

501
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,270
"Every time, All I want is you."

502
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:15,020
"I insist that every
time I want only you."

503
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:45,360
"I don't want anyone
else other than you."

504
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:52,520
"I want you to be my guardian,
in every journey."

505
00:38:53,020 --> 00:39:00,270
"You're the one I want
for the rest of my life."

506
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,150
"if you're the sweet
pain in my heart.."

507
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,520
"I don't want any cure."

508
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:17,480
"I want you coursing through
my veins like blood."

509
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,150
"No matter what the consequences.."

510
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,610
"..but this is the beginning I want."

511
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,520
"I want you."

512
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,730
"Day and night, all I want is you."

513
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,770
"I want you."

514
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,520
"I want you."

515
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,730
"Every time, All I want is you."

516
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:53,150
"I insist that every
time I want only you."

517
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:14,610
"My wounds need to be touched by you."

518
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:22,400
"My flames need your heat."

519
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:27,650
"I want you in the
world of my dreams."

520
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:35,770
"I want to see only
you when I open my eyes."

521
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,400
Then what?

522
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,520
What?

523
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,520
Then one day... Mr.
Diwedi and his son Purshottam arrived.

524
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,020
Come, Mr. Diwedi.

525
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,270
Welcome.

526
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,650
Welcome.

527
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,980
Take a seat.

528
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,440
How are you, Purshottam?

529
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,310
Sit.

530
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,480
Please, sit.

531
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,610
Pawan, please go get Rasika.
- Yes.

532
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,980
Rasika.

533
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,770
Rasika.

534
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,650
The boy and his family are here.

535
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,400
If Bajrang Bali someday
graces you with His presence..

536
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,270
...what will You ask him for, Pawan?

537
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,270
Me..

538
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,610
Do you know what I'll ask for?

539
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,900
Give me your hand.

540
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,650
Don't you trust me?

541
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,270
Where's Rasika?
- She's coming.

542
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,770
I think my daughter's feeling shy.

543
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,150
Father, you've always said..

544
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,020
...every girl tries to see the image
of her father in her future husband.

545
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,770
I see your image only in Pawan.

546
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,400
Rasika!

547
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,150
Forgive me, Mr. Diwedi.

548
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,020
We cannot go ahead with this alliance.

549
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,020
My daughter doesn't want to.

550
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,270
You could've told us earlier.

551
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,360
Why invite us home and humiliate us?

552
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,150
Forgive me.
- Let's go.

553
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,020
Let's go.

554
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,230
Who wants to stay here?

555
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,980
Sir...

556
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,400
You cannot get engaged to Rasika.

557
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,650
Until you're worthy of her.

558
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,270
And my first condition is...a house..

559
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,020
...which you'll buy with
your hard-earned money.

560
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,770
You only have six months.

561
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:05,400
Otherwise...I'll find
someone suitable for her.

562
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,980
By the way, I never asked you before.

563
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,060
What's your age?

564
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,270
Bravo, Bajrangi. Congratulations.

565
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,230
You did it.

566
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,520
Wow!

567
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,560
In a couple of months..

568
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,650
...I'll arrange for
the rent and deposit money.

569
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,520
You will. You will.

570
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,650
Of course.

571
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,520
Don't worry.

572
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,610
Dhanbad.. Etah...Kalmganj...Agra?

573
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,730
Hail Bajrang Bali.

574
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,400
If she can't speak...

575
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,480
then how do you know she's a Brahmin.

576
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,400
She's so fair, must be a Brahmin.

577
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,650
How long is she going to stay here?

578
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,150
Until we don't find her parents?

579
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,770
And when will they be found?

580
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,150
When Bajrang Bali wills

581
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,650
Have you ever travelled
by an airplane?

582
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,770
I did, once.

583
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,150
Do you know what they say?

584
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,270
When the pressure drops..

585
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:06,360
...first put on your own oxygen mask,
then help others.

586
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:13,150
How long will you keep
doing social service?

587
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,900
Think about your own life.

588
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,400
Get a decent job.

589
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,020
Find a nice home.

590
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,770
And if you can't, then tell me now.

591
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,360
So you don't waste
your time nor Rasika's.

592
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,770
Will this fit a six year old?

593
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,400
Yes.
- Pack it.

594
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,150
By the way, Pawan..

595
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,900
...if we don't find Munni's parents,
will she stay with us..

596
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,270
...even after we're married?

597
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,020
Why won't we find her parents?

598
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,270
What if she doesn't have any?

599
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,900
Who doesn't have parents?

600
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:18,770
Orphans!

601
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,520
Who is your favorite player?

602
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,980
Dhoni!

603
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,110
Virat Kohli.

604
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:27,770
Yuvi!

605
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,520
Shikhar Dhawan?

606
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,110
Sehwag?

607
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,810
These are the only players.

608
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,610
I bet you know nothing about cricket.

609
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,730
Munni is not an orphan.

610
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,150
Otherwise Lord Bajrang Bali
would've given me some indication

611
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,480
Pawan.

612
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,980
When did He tell you
that she has parents?

613
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,650
Munni!

614
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,020
Munni!
- What happened to Munni?

615
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,190
Munni!

616
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,650
What happened to Munni?

617
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,650
Where is Munni.

618
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,020
Well...l can't find her anywhere.

619
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,150
What?

620
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,520
We were just eating together,
suddenly she disappeared.

621
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,520
Munni isn't
on the terrace either.

622
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,650
Oh, God!

623
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,480
Munni! Munni!

624
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,020
Munni!

625
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,150
Munni!

626
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,110
Munni!

627
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,230
Munni!

628
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,400
Mun...

629
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,520
Pawan!

630
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Pawan!

631
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,650
Chicken barra,
Chicken Muglai, chicken hariyali..

632
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,650
...chicken lollypop,
chicken kadai, chicken tawa..

633
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,520
...chicken tandoori, chicken masala,
chicken kohlapuri, chicken afghani..

634
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,860
...chicken kashmiri, chicken
hyderabadi, chicken fried rice..

635
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,560
...chicken noodles,
chicken Manchurian, chicken 69..

636
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,810
...chicken Kofta,
Chicken Korma, Chicken Chaudhary..

637
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,150
Mister..

638
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,150
Mister..
- Yes, sir.

639
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,270
Serve your best item to her.
- Okay.

640
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,400
She's so fair,
I thought she must be a Brahmin.

641
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,730
Must be a Kshatriya.

642
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,520
They eat meat and also
have a fair complexion.

643
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,270
Yes, she must be a Kshatriya.

644
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,900
Why is Munni crying?

645
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,150
"I am hungry."

646
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,110
"I am hungry."

647
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,650
"I am hungry."

648
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,650
"I am hungry."

649
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,770
"I very am hungry."

650
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,730
"The rooster's croak
sounded melodious to me."

651
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,770
"Chowk Chandani,
Choudhary restaurant."

652
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,400
"Day and night...
the place is always crowded."

653
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,520
"Chowk Chandani,
Choudhary restaurant."

654
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,440
"Day and night...
the place is always crowded."

655
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,190
"Half the food's non-veg
and other half is veg."

656
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,650
"Tell me clearly...
what your intentions are."

657
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,690
"Do you want Nan or Roti."

658
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,480
"Do you want Rann or Boti."

659
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,360
"Order whatever you want,
this is going to difficult."

660
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,520
"A little Biryani Bhukhari,
and a little Nalli Nihari."

661
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,400
"Bring everything...so I can
break the norms today."

662
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:32,520
"The chicken's clucking from
the kitchen, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

663
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,150
"The only cure to your hunger
is the chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

664
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,980
"The chicken's saying today,
cuck-a-doodle-doo."

665
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,020
"The only way to fill your stomach
is a chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

666
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:48,020
"The chicken's clucking from
the kitchen, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

667
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:51,610
"The only cure to your hunger
is a chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

668
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,610
"The chicken's saying today,
cuck-a-doodle-doo."

669
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,650
"The only way to fill your stomach
is a chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

670
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,650
"My stomach churning,
I am really hungry."

671
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,650
"My throat's really dry."

672
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,270
"Every part of my
body is getting weak."

673
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,110
"And my entire body's shivering."

674
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,400
"My hunger's growing."

675
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,400
"Like making a mountain
out of a mole."

676
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,360
"My face has turned pale too."

677
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,900
"Every part of my
body is getting weak."

678
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,190
"And my entire body's shivering."

679
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,310
"Get me the Koftas and the Kormas."

680
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,190
"The Shorbas and the Shawrma."

681
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,650
"Let break all the fasts."

682
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,980
"A little Biryani Bhukhari,
and a little Nalli Nihari."

683
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,900
"Bring everything...
so I can break my norms."

684
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,770
"The chicken's clucking from
the kitchen, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

685
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,520
"The only cure to your hunger
is a chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

686
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,480
"The chicken's saying today,
cuck-a-doodle-doo."

687
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,400
"The only way to fill your stomach
is a chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

688
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,400
"The chicken's clucking from
the kitchen, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

689
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,360
"The only cure to your hunger
is a chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

690
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,230
"The chicken's saying today,
cuck-a-doodle-doo."

691
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,150
"The only way to fill your stomach
is a chicken, cuck-a-doodle-doo."

692
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,190
Mandi?

693
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,310
Ayodhya.

694
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,900
Patparganj.
- Muradabad?

695
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:23,440
Jhumri Talaiyya?

696
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,400
Asansol.

697
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
Come, dear.
Look, I've so many colorful bangles.

698
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,020
They're really nice.

699
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,020
Come, dear.

700
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,520
Take it.

701
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,020
My bangles.

702
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,980
Mister, please pay for the bangles.

703
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,480
Please.

704
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,150
Munni.

705
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:43,150
We don't want them.

706
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,520
Forgive her, she's just a kid.

707
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,150
It's okay.
- Munni, it's wrong to steal.

708
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Come, let's apologise to Bajrang Bali.

709
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,360
Lord...you know..

710
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:08,480
Lord, you know...l went to
a non-veg restaurant yesterday.

711
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,480
Because of Munni.

712
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,480
But I swear I didn't eat anything.

713
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,150
Munni did.

714
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,270
Munni...concentrate.

715
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,770
Munni did.

716
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:19,860
Please forgive me.

717
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,020
You know...l feel helpless
in front of Munni.

718
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:25,270
What to do?

719
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,980
Bajrang Bali,
you've already hinted..

720
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,310
...that Munni is a Kshatriya,
and not a Brahmin.

721
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,230
Right..

722
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,150
Munni?

723
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,520
Munni?

724
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,650
Munni?

725
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,520
Munni!

726
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,480
Munni!

727
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,520
Munni! Munni!

728
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:45,900
Munni!

729
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,190
Bajrang Bali, please forgive Munni.

730
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,060
After all she's naive.

731
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,150
She doesn't know the difference
between temples and mosques.

732
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,400
Come on, go in.

733
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,980
Munni!

734
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,480
Munni!

735
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,900
Munni!

736
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,400
Are you crazy?

737
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,980
What happened?

738
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:02,650
Munni..

739
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,900
Where's Munni?

740
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,440
What?
- She's that.

741
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,310
What?

742
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,730
She's a Muslim.

743
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,650
Munnni?
- Yes.

744
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,020
Didn't you notice how she
was eating chicken last night?

745
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,650
And now, she's in there..

746
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,650
...she covered her head with
the veil and was reading something.

747
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:17,900
But where is she?

748
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,400
What will your father say?

749
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,560
Pawan, where is Munni.

750
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,770
She cheated us.

751
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,610
She cheated us?
She's just a 6 year old.

752
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,810
Away from her home,
separated from her parents.

753
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,150
The poor girl can't even speak.

754
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,270
What will your father say?

755
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,520
She belongs to a different caste.

756
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,650
Pawan, don't be silly.

757
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,520
Do you know why I love you?

758
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:36,560
Because you have a clean heart.

759
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,020
Different caste...different people,
it's all nonsense.

760
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,480
Don't waste your time
in these stupid things.

761
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,900
I can't explain to father.

762
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:45,980
But I can at least tell you

763
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,610
Come on. Munni is all alone inside.

764
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,650
Where is Munni?

765
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,150
Munni.

766
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,770
Munni.

767
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,520
Pakistan needs 10 runs in <i>7</i> balls.

768
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,230
He picked that up...
and the ball's in the air.

769
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,650
Caught. He's caught it.

770
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,270
Come on, India. Munni clap...

771
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,480
Amazing, boys. Really amazing.

772
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,610
Father will throw Munni
and me out of the house.

773
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,770
Only if he finds out.

774
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:34,770
What do you mean?

775
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,310
Who will tell him?

776
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,650
I will.

777
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:39,480
Are you crazy?

778
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:46,900
Oh no...Afridi's back on strike...my god!

779
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,480
Oh no!

780
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,520
Have you read the Mahabharat?

781
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,770
You must have seen it on television.

782
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,400
What does Lord Krishna say to Arjun?

783
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,440
What?

784
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,150
One must have an honest heart,
and that you do.

785
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,980
Your job is to get Munni home.

786
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,270
After that you can tell
father anything you want.

787
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,560
Afridi is trying to stay on crease.

788
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,900
The ball's in the air again,
will it cross the boundary?

789
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,770
There's a fielder positioning himself
under the ball, but it's across the boundary.

790
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,940
Pakistan needs 3 runs to win.

791
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,310
Munni, what are you doing?
It's the wrong team.

792
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,690
Be quiet everyone.

793
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,360
This is a tense situation.

794
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,770
The ball's across the boundary again.

795
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,520
This is a magnificent
win for Pakistan.

796
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,270
Oh...God! What has he done?

797
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,060
Munni, what are you doing?

798
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,770
That's the enemy's team.

799
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,650
What's wrong with her?

800
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,810
I wonder what's wrong with her.

801
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,190
She doesn't get it.

802
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,650
What is Munni doing?

803
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,110
Munni.

804
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,980
Why is she dancing?

805
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,770
Munni, what's wrong with you?

806
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,150
What is she doing?

807
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:18,900
Munni...Pakistan!

808
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,400
You brought her home
saying she's a Brahman.

809
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,810
Are you the only kind-hearted
man on this planet?

810
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,650
The only benefactor of
sad people around the world.

811
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:37,060
There must have been other
people in Kurukshetra.

812
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,360
Why didn't they take her home?

813
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,650
Sir, I didn't do anything.

814
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,150
She was following me.

815
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:44,150
Tomorrow morning you will
take her to Pakistan embassy

816
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:44,810
Father..

817
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,650
Look, the people of her country..

818
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,690
...brutally kill
the people of my country

819
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:52,110
But father, what's Munni's fault?
- I know.

820
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:54,400
But she belongs to that country.

821
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,400
Look, I am not cruel.

822
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,400
But I can't tolerate
her in my house anymore.

823
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,360
Make arrangements to send her back.

824
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,770
Immediately.

825
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,900
"Pakistan, come to your senses!"

826
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,730
"Release Karamjeet Singh."

827
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,400
""Pakistan, come to your senses!"

828
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,150
"Release Karamjeet Singh."

829
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:40,770
"Pakistan, come to your senses!"

830
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:44,150
"Release Karamjeet Singh."

831
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,940
"Pakistan, come to your senses!"

832
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,230
"Release Karamjeet Singh."

833
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,150
Next

834
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,400
Please application passport.

835
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,810
I don't want to go to your country.

836
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:00,190
I just came to drop her here.

837
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,900
Send her back home, she's a Pakistani.

838
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,520
Hello, dear. What's your name?

839
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,610
She can't speak.

840
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:10,400
Where's her passport?
- I don't know where her passport is.

841
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,560
Then how do you know she's Pakistani.

842
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,150
Yesterday when Pakistan
won the match..

843
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,650
...she started dancing
in front of everyone.

844
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,650
In front of Sir too...

845
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:19,770
And she even kissed the
Pakistani flag, on television.

846
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,810
So that makes her Pakistani?

847
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,060
How do you know her?

848
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,730
I met her in Kurukshetra.

849
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,150
What was she doing there?
- How do I know?

850
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,560
Go away, we cannot do
anything without a passport.

851
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,730
Why not?

852
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,150
I am saying she's a Pakistani.

853
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,230
Send her home.

854
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,150
Have you lost your mind?

855
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,770
Don't you have any common sense?

856
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,110
Go away, there are
other people in the queue.

857
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:39,770
I don't care, I will leave her here.

858
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,020
Look, this is my last warning,
if you don't leave..

859
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,020
...I will call security
and throw you out.

860
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,270
And I'll call my people and..

861
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:47,310
...throw you all out of the country.

862
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,900
Throw me out?

863
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,310
I am Indian myself. A Jaini! Go away.

864
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,400
I work for the Pakistani Embassy.

865
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,270
Security. Security.

866
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:54,310
Throw him out.

867
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:56,150
"Pakistan, come to your senses!"

868
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,770
"Release Karamjeet Singh."

869
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,110
"Release Karamjeet Singh."

870
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,150
"Pakistan, come to your senses!"

871
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,980
"Pakistan, come to your senses!"

872
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,770
"Release Karamjeet Singh."

873
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,650
Some people tried to scale
the walls of the High Commission.

874
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,150
Around 14 people were
injured in this scuffle.

875
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,900
Pakistani High Commissioner,
Abdul Bashir..

876
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,770
...has said in an official
statement, that..

877
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,440
...keeping the security of
the High Commission's staff in mind..

878
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:08,150
...he's shutting down all counselor
and visa services for a month.

879
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,520
Wonderful, Bajrangi.

880
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,150
I told you to send the girl back..

881
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,270
And you shut-down the embassy instead.

882
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,520
So Munni will live
with us for another month.

883
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,770
There's no need for that.

884
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,020
Govind was saying that..

885
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,770
...there's a travel agent close
to his office, on Purani Sadak.

886
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:29,900
He'll make all the arrangements.

887
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,520
No, mister,
we don't make Pakistani passport.

888
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,900
Why not?
- Why?

889
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,270
Well...l have never made one.

890
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,400
People come here
for American passports..

891
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,650
...Canada as well.

892
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,770
England, Germany...even Japan.

893
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:46,770
But if Munni's from Pakistan,
then why will she go to Germany?

894
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:50,900
True.

895
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,520
But sorry,
we can't make Pakistani passport.

896
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:57,730
Strange.

897
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,520
Let's go, Munni.

898
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,400
Mister...

899
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,980
I have a 'without-passport' route.

900
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,980
Meaning?

901
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,270
I mean I know some people..

902
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:14,770
Who can help cross the border...

903
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,360
Really?
- Yes.

904
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,770
I can request them.

905
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,360
Please do it.

906
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,610
I am in real trouble with this girl.

907
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,230
Fine, I'll have a word with them.

908
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,400
But...do you have 150,000?

909
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,020
150,000?

910
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,900
4-4-4-4...

911
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:42,150
5-5-5-5...

912
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,270
25,000!

913
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,150
26, 27...

914
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:55,480
What's this, Rasika?

915
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:57,230
I withdrew it from the bank.

916
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,440
What have you done, Rasika?
This money was..

917
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,360
I know.

918
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,400
This money is for
the deposit of our house.

919
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:08,900
But right now...it's more important
to send Munni home.

920
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,810
No, Rasika.

921
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,650
If I don't buy a house, father
will get you married to someone else.

922
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,860
My innocent Bajrangi.

923
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,150
You still don't understand, do you?

924
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:28,980
Even the Lord...can't separate
us in this lifetime.

925
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,150
Swear on Bajrang Bali.

926
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,400
How will those agents
find Munni's parents?

927
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,610
These agents have many connections.

928
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,150
Look, mister. Don't worry.

929
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:54,150
I'll call you once we're there.

930
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,770
Here's my number.

931
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,560
As soon as Munni is
united with her parents..

932
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,150
...please call me.
- Of course.

933
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,360
Well...we should leave now.

934
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,230
Come on.

935
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,650
Don't cry, Munni.

936
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:16,230
Uncle's taking you home, to Pakistan.

937
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,020
He's taking you to your mom.

938
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:20,690
Come on, dear.

939
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,810
Munni, this isn't your country,
you cannot stay here.

940
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,520
And I can't go there.

941
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,310
Come on, dear.

942
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,900
Since I met you things
have been getting worse for me.

943
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,400
Finally you have an
opportunity to go home.

944
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,440
Now let go of me.

945
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,860
I beg you. Let me go.

946
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:38,150
Go back to your home.
I beg you!

947
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:42,650
"You let go of my hand."

948
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,900
"I am no longer in your company."

949
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:54,150
"I've lost myself looking for you."

950
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:58,730
"Why does my heart beat so slowly?"

951
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,770
"Why are my eyes filled with tear?"

952
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:09,770
"What have I become for you?"

953
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:17,270
"Since we met...l feel capable."

954
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:25,480
"Since we met...l achieved everything."

955
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:33,520
"With great difficulty...the
destination became easy."

956
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:41,650
"Because you're the heartbeat
and I am the heart."

957
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:42,980
How much?

958
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,360
25 rupees.

959
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:03,150
"The way you would get upset."

960
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,400
"And I would console you."

961
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:14,520
"While looking for your
smile...l found happiness."

962
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,610
"Every time you drifted apart."

963
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,610
"And I brought us close."

964
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:29,270
"While looking for your footsteps,
I found myself."

965
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:36,020
"Since we met...l found my destination."

966
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:44,150
"Since we met...l found my shore."

967
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:51,360
"Since we met...my
destination became easy."

968
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,440
Mister, where is that kid.
- Which kid?

969
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,360
The same one who was on your rickshaw
- There.

970
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,980
Hey, boy.

971
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:17,770
Hail Sri Ram.

972
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:18,810
Did you see a small girl here?

973
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,440
Her name is Munni.
She just arrived here.

974
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,650
Come here.

975
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,520
I'll be your Munni..
- Let go, sister.

976
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:25,900
Sister?

977
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,770
Do I look like your sister?

978
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:28,980
Munni!

979
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:31,020
Are you crazy?

980
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,900
Munni! - Why the hell you
going on screaming for Munni?

981
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,400
Munni!

982
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,770
Not yet, close the door.

983
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:38,110
Munni!

984
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,020
Where are you going?
- Stop him.

985
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,400
What are you doing?

986
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:48,770
Munni!

987
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:51,730
Who is he?

988
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,650
Get the girl back.

989
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,270
Let's sit down and talk, please.

990
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:24,900
Now?

991
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:29,150
Now I'll take Munni home myself.

992
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:32,610
Don't be crazy, Pawan.

993
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,150
You don't have a passport or a visa.

994
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,440
Nor do you know anyone there.

995
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,690
We'll find a way.

996
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:40,650
'All comforts of the
world lie at your feet.'

997
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,020
'Devotees feel fearless
under your benign Protection.'

998
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,520
'One is freed from all
the sufferings and ill fates'

999
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,770
'He who adores and
remembers Shri Hanuman.'

1000
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:58,980
I don't have a passport
or visa...nor any connections.

1001
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:03,360
But just like Bajrang Bali,
Lord Ram resides in my heart too.

1002
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:08,860
And nothing is impossible
for such a person, Rasika.

1003
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,520
Hail Sri Ram!

1004
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,650
Stop right there...

1005
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:46,020
Who are you?

1006
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:47,520
Who are you?

1007
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,270
Who are you?

1008
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,900
This is my area.

1009
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,020
So when did I say this is my area?

1010
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:55,650
Are you trying to cross the border?

1011
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,270
Let's see how you cross the border...

1012
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,900
It'll cost you 25,000...cash.

1013
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,440
If you have the cash,
then come along.

1014
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,770
Otherwise get lost.
- Come on, Munni.

1015
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:09,900
The border's got electric
fences all around.

1016
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:12,020
440 volts.

1017
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:15,980
It reduces anyone to ashes.

1018
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,730
Listen... Look here.

1019
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,230
Mohammad Ali Jinnah!

1020
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,270
Have you ever seen him?

1021
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,400
This is Pakistani currency.

1022
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,900
Gandhi isn't going to work there.

1023
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:30,360
Come, Munni.
- Listen.

1024
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:32,400
Don't you get it?

1025
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:37,020
If you go this way,
the BSF will spot you.

1026
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,770
Listen here...

1027
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:42,770
They will shoot you first
and then ask your ghost

1028
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,440
...whether you're from here or there?

1029
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,270
Listen...it's not easy
to cross the border.

1030
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,440
I have...connections.

1031
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,520
On both sides.

1032
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,020
Come on, get in the car.

1033
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,940
It's for the best interest of the kid.

1034
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,400
It'll only cost you 50,000.

1035
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,020
But you just said 25,000.

1036
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:02,480
25,000 for one person.

1037
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:05,770
Why will Munni pay, she's going home?

1038
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,020
Going home?

1039
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:12,520
That is when I decided that I myself
will take Munni back to Pakistan.

1040
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,560
Wow!

1041
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,520
I knew the moment I saw you
that you re a very righteous man.

1042
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:36,310
Listen...on the other
side of the fence..

1043
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,940
...the Pakistani army takes
rounds in every 10 minutes.

1044
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,650
There are four tunnels
under the fences.

1045
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:44,650
We'll have to crawl through
the tunnel within 10 minutes..

1046
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,060
...and get to the other side.

1047
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,770
You see those sand dunes
we need to get behind them.

1048
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,770
And then...Welcome to Pakistan!

1049
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,110
Come!

1050
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,150
I will go only after
taking permission.

1051
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:27,650
What? What will you take?

1052
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:29,650
I'll take permission
from the Pakistani Army..

1053
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:30,690
...and then go into Pakistan.

1054
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:33,400
This isn't the place to crack jokes.

1055
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,020
Let's go. Come on.

1056
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:35,650
I am a devotee of Bajrang Bali.

1057
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:37,020
Never do anything on the sly.

1058
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:38,690
Are you crazy?

1059
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:40,150
They will shoot all of us.

1060
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,360
Come on, let's go.

1061
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:46,270
Munni.
Munni, we'll first take permission.

1062
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,020
We'll take permission..

1063
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:50,860
I knew the moment I saw you...
that you're crazy.

1064
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,440
Munni, you tell him.

1065
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,150
You fool,
the camels are coming this way.

1066
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,110
Come on, run.

1067
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,020
Come on, or you will die.

1068
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,560
You won't live through this.

1069
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,900
Munni, we'll take permission first.

1070
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:14,980
Who are you?

1071
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:17,230
Hail Sri Ram.

1072
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,110
Hail Sri Ram.

1073
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,730
Are you Indian?

1074
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:33,270
Yes. But Munni is Pakistani.

1075
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:35,650
She got separated from her parents.

1076
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,980
I am taking her to Pakistan
to reunite them.

1077
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,860
Sir, this is a story
we've never heard before!

1078
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,520
Then why didn't you just leave?

1079
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,020
I am a devotee of Bajrang Bali.

1080
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,400
Never do anything on the sly.

1081
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:54,810
I was waiting here
for your permission.

1082
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,520
This is the Pakistan border

1083
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,190
If at all you wanted permission...

1084
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:59,520
then why didn't you
go to the Pakistan embassy?

1085
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:02,310
I did go to the Pakistan embassy,
the one in Delhi.

1086
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,730
Isn't it, Munni? Didn't we?

1087
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,940
But they threw us out.

1088
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:09,980
So how did you get here?

1089
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:12,520
Boo Ali brought us here.
- Boo Ali.

1090
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,690
Boo Ali is an agent.

1091
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,900
He was saying that he has
connections on both sides.

1092
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,150
What nonsense.

1093
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:18,770
How did you get on
this side of the fence?

1094
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:21,400
Through the tunnel.
We crawled all the way.

1095
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,810
It's a straight tunnel.

1096
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,480
Tunnel? Where?

1097
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,770
He is standing on it.

1098
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,020
Take a look.
- Sir.

1099
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,020
Look

1100
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,650
Sir, he's definitely a spy.

1101
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:40,110
Shall we arrest him?

1102
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,110
No.

1103
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:49,150
Throw them back into the same tunnel

1104
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,020
And fill the tunnel with sand.

1105
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,020
Run away or else we will shoot!

1106
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,400
Go on.

1107
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:22,230
Hail Sri Ram!

1108
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,480
What..

1109
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,230
Beat him.

1110
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:49,270
Munni...don't worry.

1111
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,650
It's nothing.
Doesn't hurt at all.

1112
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:52,650
Doesn't hurt..

1113
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,520
It does hurt.

1114
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,900
All this is scaring her, that's why...

1115
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:02,270
Leave him!

1116
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,270
Leave him!

1117
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:10,400
How did you come back?

1118
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,860
There's another tunnel over there.

1119
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,400
Who told you about this tunnel?
- Boo Ali.

1120
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,730
Boo Ali.

1121
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:22,810
Sir, I've promised Bajrang Bali..

1122
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:27,400
...I won't rest until I
reunite Munni with her parents.

1123
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:31,770
I will teach you..
- Rafiq! Stay back!

1124
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:38,190
Look, I wouldn't have
allowed you through here..

1125
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:40,860
...even if you had
a passport and a visa.

1126
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,520
Go back right now.

1127
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,690
It's for your best interest.

1128
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:52,650
Sir, I promise I
will return to India..

1129
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:57,110
...as soon as I find Munni's parents.

1130
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:06,770
Look, exactly 10 minutes later..

1131
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,900
...we'll come back
here doing our rounds.

1132
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,520
Within those 10 minutes,
whether you go this way..

1133
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,400
...or back there, we don't know.

1134
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,150
But, sir..
- But.

1135
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:22,360
But if I see you again,
I will definitely shoot you.

1136
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,230
Come on.

1137
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:31,020
And find out who the hell is Boo Ali?
- Yes, sir.

1138
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,020
Hail Sri Ram.

1139
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,520
Sir, he's definitely crazy.

1140
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:10,810
You don't care about your life,
but think about this girl.

1141
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:15,770
Sir, I could've disappeared
into the night before you returned.

1142
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,690
But I am a devotee
of Bajrang Bali, and..

1143
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:19,150
Yeah, we know.

1144
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:21,310
You don't do anything on the sly.

1145
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,690
And you've made a promise.

1146
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,610
Don't you have anything else to say?

1147
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,900
I promise you,
I will return to India..

1148
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,900
...as soon as I take
Munni to her parents.

1149
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:33,520
Just give me permission.

1150
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,270
I told you to go, so why didn't you?

1151
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:41,060
That wasn't any permission, sir.
It would've still been on the sly

1152
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,730
Sir, he's completely crazy.

1153
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,150
Fine, go.

1154
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:55,520
Sir?

1155
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:57,150
Sir? Sir?

1156
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,730
Can I go, sir?
- Yes, go.

1157
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,650
Munni, let's go.

1158
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:16,020
If you truly are Bajrang
Bali's devotee, then do come back.

1159
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,110
It's a promise, sir.

1160
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:26,520
Hail Sri Ram!

1161
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,730
You're right.

1162
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:39,520
He's definitely crazy.

1163
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:43,270
"You're my path."

1164
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:47,110
"You're my companion."

1165
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:54,360
"I found myself while
looking for you."

1166
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:02,610
"I am your voice...you're my words."

1167
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:09,150
"I heard what you never said."

1168
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:16,360
"Since we met...l feel capable."

1169
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:23,770
"Since we met...
I've achieved everything."

1170
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:31,860
"With great difficulty...the
destination became easy."

1171
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:38,980
"Because you're the heartbeat
and I am the heart."

1172
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:51,770
Mister.

1173
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:54,900
Yes, brother.

1174
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:57,650
Can I get something vegetarian?
- What?

1175
01:28:57,810 --> 01:28:59,650
Vegetables.

1176
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,270
Veggies.

1177
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,810
There are vegetables in this.

1178
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:05,440
There's beetroot, capsicum, peas.

1179
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,400
Spinach too.
Full of vegetables.

1180
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,400
No...only vegetables.

1181
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:12,020
What's wrong? Is the kid unwell?

1182
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,900
What's wrong, dear?

1183
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:16,810
No, she's absolutely fine.
Then, are you unwell?

1184
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:17,900
No.

1185
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,520
Then why do you want only
eat vegetables?

1186
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:26,770
Well, keep that one
and take this one away.

1187
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:30,480
And get me some tea and bread.

1188
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:35,270
Bilal.

1189
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,650
If you serve me cold bread
again like yesterday, I'll whack you.

1190
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,150
Understand.

1191
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,400
Eat quickly,
Munni and let's get out of here.

1192
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,400
Did you eat your fill, Munni?

1193
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,560
Now we'll find your
parents very quickly!

1194
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,650
Stop!

1195
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:06,020
Wait.

1196
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:09,650
Munni, why is that cop
coming this way? - Wait.

1197
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:15,400
Where are the handcuffs?
- What handcuffs?

1198
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:17,480
The one you stole from my belt buckle.

1199
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:19,190
Who steals handcuffs?

1200
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:21,110
Search his bag. Check it.

1201
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:24,770
Wait. Wait. Look...Look...take a look.

1202
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,150
Are there any handcuffs?

1203
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,560
There are no handcuffs in it.

1204
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,900
Not there?
And hers?

1205
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:32,400
What will a small
girl do with handcuffs?

1206
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:35,150
Show them, Munni.

1207
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:36,150
Give it, dear.

1208
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:37,900
Here...take a look.

1209
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:39,520
Check it.

1210
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,520
Check it.

1211
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,270
What's your name?

1212
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:58,400
Pawan.
- Pawan what?

1213
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,150
Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.

1214
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:03,480
People call me Bajrangi.
- We won't.

1215
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:04,980
Are you Indian?

1216
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:06,770
Yes.

1217
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,400
Show me your passport.

1218
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,400
I don't have a passport.

1219
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,270
You don't have a passport.
Then how did you get into Pakistan?

1220
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,770
I crawled under the fence.
- Under the fence?

1221
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,270
Yes, but I took permission.

1222
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:22,440
I don't like lies.

1223
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,020
I don't lie,
I am a devotee of Bajrangi Bali.

1224
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:26,860
You entered our country in
the dead of the night like thieves.

1225
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,770
Do you know who does that?

1226
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,150
Rats or spies.

1227
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:31,440
I am not a spy.

1228
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,480
And Munni is Pakistani.

1229
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,020
She's Pakistani.

1230
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:37,770
I see...she's Pakistani.

1231
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,520
I see...she's Pakistani!

1232
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:50,520
Yeah...and I am Sachin Tendulkar.

1233
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:51,900
Arrest him.

1234
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,690
Bring him along.

1235
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:56,020
Come on.

1236
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:01,270
People are coming from
Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1237
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:02,150
He's back again.

1238
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:04,270
Please...we'll miss the train.

1239
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,770
People are coming Karachi..

1240
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:07,560
What are you doing?
Stop them.

1241
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,310
Please...we'll miss the train.

1242
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:11,520
People are coming
from Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1243
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:13,150
What an ungrateful man..

1244
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,400
Go that way.

1245
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:18,810
People are coming from
Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1246
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:19,650
What are you doing, madam?

1247
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:21,650
Please go that way,
we'll miss the train.

1248
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,360
People are arriving in Karachi..

1249
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,440
People are arriving
in Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1250
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,690
What are you doing? Stop them.

1251
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:30,270
Please go that way,
we'll miss the train.

1252
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,980
People are coming from
Karachi to celebrate Eid.

1253
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:36,020
This is Chand Nawab from Chawra
along with cameraman Kamil Yusuf.

1254
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,650
What a rascal..

1255
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,480
Why are you standing on the
middle of the road?

1256
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:40,770
What nonsense.

1257
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:43,520
You're blabbering here like a fool.

1258
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:45,810
The police just caught an Indian spy.

1259
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,770
Indian spy? Where?

1260
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:48,650
At Bilal's eatery.

1261
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:50,150
They are taking him
to the police station.

1262
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,110
Come on.
This is breaking news.

1263
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,650
Did Pawan call?
- No.

1264
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,560
But he will soon.

1265
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,900
He must have helped
Munni board the train by now.

1266
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,900
Didn't you tell him to
call as soon as he got to Wagah?

1267
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,770
I did, maybe he forgot.

1268
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,270
Then you could've called him instead.

1269
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:18,400
Hamid Sir...

1270
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,690
We've reached the police station,
please come quickly.

1271
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,360
Greetings.

1272
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,770
Yeah, greetings.

1273
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:29,520
Tell us about your mission.
- Mission?

1274
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:31,810
Yes, I did take permission.

1275
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:32,810
No, tell me in detail.

1276
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:33,650
Start from the beginning.

1277
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:36,020
How did you get into Pakistan?

1278
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,400
I crawled under the fence?

1279
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,360
How much are they paying
you for this dangerous mission?

1280
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:44,150
Pay? Why will I get paid?

1281
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:46,150
I am doing this willingly.

1282
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:48,520
I see...so you're a patriot.
- What?

1283
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,270
What do they call it?

1284
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,810
Patriot!

1285
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:54,150
You're a patriot.
- Without a doubt. What? Patriot, patriot

1286
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:56,520
What's the role of the kid?

1287
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,520
Get the kid in frame.

1288
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:59,060
Munni's the main reason.

1289
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:01,900
That's enough, get lost.

1290
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:04,110
Get in front.

1291
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,150
Hurry UP-

1292
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,730
As you saw in our exclusive footage..

1293
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:15,270
...An Indian spy was arrested
along with his 6 year old companion..

1294
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,730
...from Chawra district.

1295
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:20,940
The child's been trained so well..

1296
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,690
...that she didn't even speak a word.

1297
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,900
This is Chand Nawab, along
with cameraman Kamil Yusuf, Chawra.

1298
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:28,900
Shall we do it once more?
- Got it.

1299
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,520
Flabby police man.

1300
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:32,400
Stop recording.

1301
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,110
Sir.

1302
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,610
It's an Indian number.

1303
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:45,650
What happened?

1304
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,150
His phone's switched off.

1305
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:49,980
Sir, I just got an
explosive interview.

1306
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:51,900
Of an Indian spy.

1307
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:55,770
I swear...this will make
your channel no.1 in Pakistan.

1308
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,650
It's Chand Nawab.

1309
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:01,610
Says he has interviewed
some Indian spy.

1310
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,110
What nonsense.
Tell him I am not here.

1311
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:10,020
Shamsher sir isn't here.
- Oh no. that's a problem.

1312
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:14,650
Anyway, ask him to call
me as soon as he gets back.

1313
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:17,150
Until then I'll prepare a report.

1314
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,360
Hello. Hello.

1315
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:21,310
Hello.

1316
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:23,020
What's your motive
behind coming to Pakistan?

1317
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:24,690
How many times do I tell you?

1318
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,150
I came here to unite
Munni with her parents.

1319
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,900
Keep lying and you'll
never see daylight again.

1320
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:31,650
I don't lie.

1321
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,560
Where are you going?

1322
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,020
What happened, Munni?

1323
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,480
Do you know that place?

1324
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,520
Is that where your home is?

1325
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:42,980
Munni...

1326
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,150
This is Munni's home.

1327
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:47,310
What's going on here?
- We found it, sir.

1328
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:49,770
We found Munni's home.
- What's this charade?

1329
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:50,650
What's your name?

1330
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:52,150
She's can't speak.

1331
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:53,270
Can't speak?

1332
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,690
Why? Has the cat got her tongue?

1333
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:57,020
Let me see.

1334
01:35:57,690 --> 01:35:59,730
Show me.

1335
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,400
Open your mouth.

1336
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,650
Open your mouth.

1337
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,060
According to our sources..

1338
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:31,150
...the Indian spy is being
kept under tight security.

1339
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:35,020
It's being said that he'll
be shifted directly to Islamabad.

1340
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:36,310
Where are you shifting to?

1341
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:37,150
Look.

1342
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,480
Come quickly.

1343
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,650
Come on. Get on.

1344
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:44,610
I have the camera,
how are you going to shoot?

1345
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,770
There...in the bus.

1346
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,770
Come on.

1347
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:58,020
Pedal harder!

1348
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,650
You can't do it.

1349
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:03,020
I am going to spy on this spy.

1350
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,520
Let's take this, it is faster.

1351
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:07,150
Where are you going?

1352
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:08,400
Let's go on this.

1353
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:10,810
Ticket.

1354
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:13,020
"Thank god we got away Munni."

1355
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:17,520
Hello.

1356
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:19,650
Sir, this is Chand Navab,
from district Chawra.

1357
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,560
That Indian spy is in the bus.
- Which bus?

1358
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:24,560
The same bus I am in.

1359
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,520
He's right in front of me,
come quickly.

1360
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:28,400
You fool, which bus is it?

1361
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,980
It's en-route to Alipur,
it's called Chhammo Diwani.

1362
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:33,230
Ticket.

1363
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,520
Do you recognize this place?

1364
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:38,270
Don't joke, mister.

1365
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,440
Just tell me where you want to go.

1366
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,020
This child is from Pakistan.

1367
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:45,150
I don't know how
she got to India. Alone.

1368
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:47,440
I think she got separated
from her parents.

1369
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:50,190
She can't speak,
but she recognizes this place.

1370
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:52,770
I am sure she belongs
from somewhere here.

1371
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:54,520
You're from India?

1372
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:01,900
Yes!

1373
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,020
How?

1374
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:14,190
I crawled under the
fence of the border.

1375
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:15,610
But with permission.

1376
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:19,020
You came all the way to Pakistan..

1377
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,150
...to find the parents of this child?
- Yes.

1378
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,310
Why?

1379
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:24,690
Surprising, brother.

1380
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:28,400
I wish there were more people
like you in both our countries.

1381
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,610
Show me the picture.

1382
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:33,650
Sir...
- Speak properly.

1383
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:35,060
Stop stammering..

1384
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:36,770
He escaped, sir.
- What?

1385
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,650
Does anyone recognize this place?

1386
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:42,360
Take a good look.

1387
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,020
Brother?

1388
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,650
No.

1389
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,270
There? Must be that one.

1390
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,110
Quickly.

1391
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:04,060
That one.

1392
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,480
That way. Come on.

1393
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:23,150
What's wrong, sir?

1394
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:27,060
Did a man in a brown sweater
get on this bus, along with a kid?

1395
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,810
No, sir. No such man got on this bus?

1396
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:33,560
Has anyone seen a man
along with a small kid?

1397
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,190
No, sir. We haven't.

1398
01:39:35,190 --> 01:39:36,440
No.

1399
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,980
Chand Nawab said it was this bus.

1400
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:40,400
Get down.

1401
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:46,150
Sir, that girl was pointing
towards a picture of the mountains.

1402
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:47,650
Maybe that's her home.

1403
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:48,650
Where's the photo?

1404
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:50,900
They took the photo.

1405
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:53,810
Check all the buses on the highway.

1406
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:55,230
Come on.
- Yes.

1407
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:28,770
Either you're very
brave...or a big fool.

1408
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:32,230
You just entered Pakistan,
without any fear...

1409
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:35,900
This was the only way
to bring Munni to Pakistan.

1410
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:37,020
Yes, that's okay.

1411
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:40,020
But how will you find her parents?

1412
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:42,480
Bajrang Bali will help me.

1413
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:43,900
Even in Pakistan?

1414
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:57,020
You'll be safe here tonight.

1415
01:40:57,310 --> 01:41:00,020
But brother, be sure to leave by dawn.

1416
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,150
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1417
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,770
What place is this?
- Mosque.

1418
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:27,270
Forgive me, Bajrang Bali.
Forgive me.

1419
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:45,270
Greetings.

1420
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,940
What's wrong, young man?

1421
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,770
Are you sick? You look restless.

1422
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:52,150
What's wrong with me?

1423
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:56,150
I am absolutely fine.
Then why are you standing out here.

1424
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:57,060
Let's go in.

1425
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,520
Hey...listen.

1426
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:00,810
Why didn't you come yesterday?

1427
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:02,150
Go on.

1428
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,520
Sit in the class, I am coming.

1429
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:06,020
I can't go in.
- Why?

1430
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:07,900
I am not a Muslim.

1431
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,020
So what, brother?

1432
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:15,400
This place is open to everyone.

1433
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:18,230
That's why we never lock the mosque.

1434
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:20,020
Come on.

1435
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:27,150
Come on, children, to your places.

1436
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,270
So that's the case.

1437
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:51,770
I've never been to
the mountainous regions.

1438
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:56,230
But there are some children
in my class, who belong from there.

1439
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,110
Let me ask.

1440
01:42:58,650 --> 01:43:00,480
Children.

1441
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:05,480
Yes, teacher

1442
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,560
Yes.

1443
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,400
Everyone take a good
look at this picture..

1444
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:12,270
...and tell me where it is.

1445
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:17,900
And whoever gives the
right answer will get a reward.

1446
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,770
Me! Me! Me! Me!

1447
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:22,150
Stop.

1448
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:25,770
Reverse...reverse...

1449
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:28,650
Wasn't he with Chand Nawab?

1450
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:33,900
Come here.

1451
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:37,060
Listen.

1452
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,480
Catch him.

1453
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:49,520
Teacher, this is Switzerland.

1454
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,730
Arshad, if you don't
know pass it to someone else.

1455
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:58,770
Honestly,
teacher, this is Switzerland.

1456
01:43:58,770 --> 01:44:00,400
See...it's written here in English.

1457
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:01,770
SWITZERLAND!

1458
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:09,900
Munni, are you from Switzerland?

1459
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:17,860
Catch him.
- Stop.

1460
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:19,770
Stop.

1461
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:22,020
Stop.

1462
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:25,270
Where are you going? Stop.

1463
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,480
Stop.

1464
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:42,860
Stop.

1465
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,400
Such mesmerizing mountains
are found in Kashmir.

1466
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,270
Kashmir?

1467
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:52,360
Will I have to go back to India?

1468
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,520
No, mister.

1469
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:57,730
We have a part of it too.

1470
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,360
What?
- Kashmir.

1471
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:04,610
Dean

1472
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:17,400
Stop, please keep these
weapons in your car first.

1473
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:20,520
Priest, did you see
a stranger lurking around?

1474
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:23,650
There are no strangers
in the house of God.

1475
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:25,400
This stranger can be dangerous.

1476
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,110
He's an Indian spy.

1477
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:33,400
You think I have the
formula for the atom bomb..

1478
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,520
...which he'll come here to steal.

1479
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,020
But if you see any strange,
then do inform us.

1480
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,360
Of course.

1481
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:50,110
It's difficult to get out of here.

1482
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,900
What now?

1483
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:58,610
I have an idea.

1484
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:11,150
Bajrang Bali how much more
are you going to test your devotee?

1485
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:12,270
You made me sleep in the mosque.

1486
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,400
Made me wear this burqha

1487
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,650
Please help us find Munni's parents
before I get circumcised.

1488
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:18,400
I'll be indebted to you.

1489
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:31,020
What?
- Oh, God!

1490
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,810
He's gone to Pakistan.

1491
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:36,270
You said he'll take Munni
to Attari station and come back.

1492
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,150
How could he go to Pakistan?

1493
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:39,900
Who gave him passport and visa?

1494
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,400
He's gone without them.

1495
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,520
Without..

1496
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,310
He's gone to Pakistan
without a passport and a visa.

1497
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:47,400
Please calm down, you'll get sick.

1498
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:51,020
You don't know what those
Pakistanis will do to him.

1499
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:57,110
I can't handle even one.

1500
01:46:57,690 --> 01:46:59,270
And the priest has two.

1501
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,270
The police must be
patrolling the roads.

1502
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:19,770
Walk through the fields
to get to Khanewal.

1503
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:23,150
Thank you.

1504
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,520
You're doing a good deed.

1505
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,520
I'll pray to Allah
that you find her parents.

1506
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:50,270
Goodbye.

1507
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,020
What do you say?

1508
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:03,020
Hail Lord Ram?

1509
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:05,020
Hail Lord Ram!

1510
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:06,230
Hail Lord Ram!

1511
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,520
Hail Lord Ram!

1512
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,400
Shall we go?

1513
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:26,610
This is all your fault.

1514
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:29,020
If you hadn't been obstinate
about sending Munni home..

1515
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:30,270
...Pawan wouldn't have gone himself.

1516
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,610
He's badly in trouble because of you.

1517
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:34,150
Now do something.

1518
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,020
What can I do?

1519
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:40,400
If you don't do anything, then
I'll go to Pakistan looking for him.

1520
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,360
What?

1521
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,360
Oh, God!

1522
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,770
Without a visa!

1523
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,900
I can't wear this anymore.

1524
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,690
I can't breathe or walk.

1525
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:55,810
Look, one of us has
to pose as the wife.

1526
01:48:55,810 --> 01:48:57,810
The police are looking
for two men along with a child.

1527
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:59,230
Then you pose as the wife.

1528
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:00,650
I see.

1529
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:02,150
If anyone asks,
you will readily tell him..

1530
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:06,020
...that my name is Pawan
Kumar Chaturvedi, I am from India.

1531
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,190
I am a devotee of Bajrang Bali.

1532
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:08,150
I took permission to get here.

1533
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:09,150
And I have come crawling
under the fences.

1534
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:09,770
Right, Munni?

1535
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:12,650
Look, people are coming.

1536
01:49:12,810 --> 01:49:15,360
Cover your face. Come on.

1537
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,270
And walk with some grace.

1538
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:33,650
Munni...will you do one thing for me?

1539
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:37,520
Munni is going to get caught.

1540
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:40,020
Mister.

1541
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:43,860
Mister.
- She's safe.

1542
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:13,020
This is wrong?

1543
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:15,310
Things always go wrong when you lie.

1544
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:16,310
You wait and watch.

1545
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:17,770
You spoke again, dear.

1546
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:19,900
Cover your face.

1547
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:29,150
This car's just..

1548
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:33,520
Mister, can I help you?

1549
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:35,110
Come on.

1550
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:40,900
Sit inside.

1551
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:43,520
You hit the ignition,
when I tell you to.

1552
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,150
Yes, did you find anything?

1553
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:58,060
Takes time, mister. Takes time sir,
to find the right nerve.

1554
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:59,900
Are you a mechanic or a physician?

1555
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,730
Turn it on?

1556
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:17,770
What did you do?

1557
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:19,150
Again.

1558
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:21,770
This is what I did.

1559
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:24,770
You fixed it.

1560
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:27,770
It's our duty to
help fellow companions.

1561
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,770
Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.

1562
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:34,480
Can I drop you somewhere?

1563
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,230
What's your name, dear?

1564
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:43,480
She can't talk, sir?
She's mute.

1565
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,650
Yes.

1566
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:47,770
How does a mother feel?

1567
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:51,770
What do the doctors say, ma'am?

1568
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:53,770
She can't talk either?

1569
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,150
Same-to-same.

1570
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:57,310
It's hereditary.

1571
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,270
Oh my.

1572
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,110
It's fate.

1573
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,400
Yes, that's true.

1574
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:06,900
You're heading towards Khanewal,
aren't you?

1575
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:12,440
No. But don't worry,
I'll get you home.

1576
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:16,900
No, no, no need to take the trouble.
Just drop us at the highway.

1577
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:18,900
It won't be a problem at all.

1578
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:21,150
I will tell one of my constables

1579
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:24,020
And he'll drop you home in his jeep.

1580
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:25,980
Yes..
Constable

1581
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:28,520
Yes, I am the area inspector.

1582
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,110
I was on leave today

1583
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:34,560
But I am going back because
there's an emergency.

1584
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,310
Emergency?

1585
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:38,860
An Indian spy is at large here.

1586
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:50,230
Let's see how long he can escape for!

1587
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,770
Where's Chand Nawab?
- I don't know.

1588
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:54,770
You don't know.

1589
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:55,650
I don't know.

1590
01:52:55,810 --> 01:52:57,650
I swear I don't know.

1591
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:03,150
The last I saw him,
he was boarding the bus after the spy

1592
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,560
I tried calling him.

1593
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,650
But his phone's switched off.

1594
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:14,230
Call him right now...
in front of me...

1595
01:53:22,690 --> 01:53:24,150
It's switched off.

1596
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:34,150
Come, mister.

1597
01:53:34,310 --> 01:53:36,110
I've reached my destination.

1598
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:40,150
Now my man will take you to yours.

1599
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:42,400
Sir.
- Sir.

1600
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,060
Sir..

1601
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:43,980
Come.

1602
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,770
Hasan.
- Yes, sir.

1603
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:47,230
Come here.
- Yes.

1604
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,770
They are my special guests.

1605
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:51,730
And he is a great mechanic as well.

1606
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:54,650
Take them to their home in Khanewal.

1607
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:55,900
Yes, sir. Come.

1608
01:53:56,190 --> 01:53:57,150
Thank you, sir.

1609
01:53:57,150 --> 01:54:00,060
No, thank you.
You really helped me a lot.

1610
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:01,650
How about some snacks before you go?

1611
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:04,150
No, we'll go.
- Come.

1612
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:05,400
Come.

1613
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:09,150
Come. Sit.

1614
01:54:14,190 --> 01:54:15,150
Carefully.

1615
01:54:23,770 --> 01:54:24,610
Goodbye.

1616
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:27,400
Goodbye.

1617
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:29,400
Keep calling him every hour.

1618
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,400
He'll pickup sometime.

1619
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:49,770
Where is your house?
- Just a little ahead.

1620
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:53,770
You don't know the way.

1621
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:58,020
We're coming back after a long time.

1622
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:00,560
Actually we ran away and got married.

1623
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,230
So her father's angry with us.

1624
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:05,440
This is it.

1625
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,900
Stop here.
- It's this one.

1626
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:09,520
Thank God we found your home.

1627
01:55:09,690 --> 01:55:11,650
You even forgot your home.

1628
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:14,020
What can I say?
- It's alright.

1629
01:55:14,310 --> 01:55:16,020
Call Waqar.

1630
01:55:19,150 --> 01:55:19,770
Yes, sir.

1631
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:22,400
What's the information
on that spy from headquarters?

1632
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,770
Sir the spy's name
is Pawan aka Bajrangi.

1633
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:26,690
And there's a local
journalist accompanying him.

1634
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:27,810
Chand Nawab.

1635
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:30,690
Come, I'll see you in.
- No, thank you.

1636
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:33,520
Thank you for bringing us here.

1637
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:34,770
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1638
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:36,020
Take care.

1639
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:51,560
Father. How are you?

1640
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:53,770
Who are you?
- Forsake your anger.

1641
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:55,770
Look, I've brought your
daughter and granddaughter.

1642
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:56,860
Come, dear.

1643
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:00,860
Who is this child
and what is she doing?

1644
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:02,810
But I don't have a daughter.

1645
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:05,520
There's no point in
arguing on the streets.

1646
01:56:05,690 --> 01:56:07,520
Let's go inside and you can scold me
as much as you want

1647
01:56:07,690 --> 01:56:11,400
I don't know you..
- We got married without your permission.

1648
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,440
You're angry with us.
- But..

1649
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,690
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.

1650
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:19,520
Hit me. Hit me.
- Uncle, forget it.

1651
01:56:19,810 --> 01:56:21,650
Oh come on. Hit me.

1652
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:23,440
Hit me.

1653
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,650
Let's go in.

1654
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:26,020
Let's go in.

1655
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:28,310
Why do I go in?
- Forget it uncle.

1656
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:29,400
Dean

1657
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,360
Get my shoe.

1658
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,150
Someone's barging in our house.

1659
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:34,770
Oh God!

1660
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:36,520
Come on.

1661
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,150
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1662
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:43,310
And there's a little girl with them.

1663
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:45,230
Little girl? How old?

1664
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,860
Around 5 or 6 years old.

1665
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:48,900
5-6...years.

1666
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,520
And she can't speak!
- She can't speak?

1667
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:52,520
Yes, sir.

1668
01:56:52,690 --> 01:56:54,900
Don't just stand
there and stare at me.

1669
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,650
Radio Hasan immediately.

1670
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,560
Uncle.
- Who is it?

1671
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:03,650
Uncle. Open the door.

1672
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:05,770
Don't break down the door.

1673
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:09,270
You?
- Where are they?

1674
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:09,900
Who?

1675
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:11,520
Your daughter and son-in-law.

1676
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:13,020
How many times do I have to tell you..

1677
01:57:13,190 --> 01:57:14,770
...I don't have a
daughter or a son-in-law.

1678
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:16,560
Where are those people..

1679
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,520
...who were calling themselves
your daughter and son-in-law?

1680
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:19,690
I don't know.

1681
01:57:19,690 --> 01:57:22,150
They left as soon as you did.

1682
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,900
"One day draped in the color of love."

1683
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:29,770
"On the corner of your lane."

1684
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:37,270
"I'll write my name along with yours,
on your palm."

1685
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:41,020
"Then you'll stop being formal."

1686
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:44,770
"Lower your eyes.."

1687
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:51,150
"..and rest your head
on my shoulder, O life..."

1688
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:57,610
"Tell me something, O life."

1689
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:06,020
"Where do I find you, O life."

1690
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:12,900
"Tell me something, O life."

1691
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:21,400
"Where do I find you, O life."

1692
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:37,270
"On a star filled night...we'll
read your letter together."

1693
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:44,650
"And the page that you left blank."

1694
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:52,020
"You can fill in your complaints,
and I will do it too."

1695
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:58,730
"Just don't get angry, O life."

1696
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:05,150
"Tell me something, O life."

1697
01:59:06,810 --> 01:59:13,520
"Where do I find you, O life."

1698
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:20,860
"Tell me something, O life."

1699
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:28,480
"Where do I find you, O life."

1700
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:32,520
"I exist where you do."

1701
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:36,650
"Everywhere I see, I see you."

1702
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:40,270
"You're the dawn of love."

1703
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,770
"You're the prayers in my heart."

1704
01:59:44,190 --> 01:59:47,610
"You're the only one I speak of."

1705
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:51,650
"You're the sights,
you're the breeze."

1706
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:55,230
"You're the beautiful ambiance."

1707
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:59,150
"You're peace, you're serenity."

1708
01:59:59,310 --> 02:00:02,610
"I exist where you do."

1709
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:06,520
"Everywhere I see, I see you."

1710
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:10,150
"You're the dawn of love."

1711
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:13,770
"You're the prayers in my heart."

1712
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:17,650
"You're the only one I speak of."

1713
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:21,400
"You're the sights,
you're the breeze."

1714
02:00:21,650 --> 02:00:25,270
"You're the beautiful ambiance."

1715
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,770
"You're peace, you're serenity."

1716
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:32,520
"I exist where you do."

1717
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:36,400
"Everywhere I see, I see you."

1718
02:00:36,690 --> 02:00:39,980
"You're the dawn of love."

1719
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:43,980
"You're the prayers in my heart."

1720
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:51,440
Chand Nawab, I was thinking about..

1721
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,360
...turning myself over to the police.

1722
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:58,770
Then somehow the police
will find her home.

1723
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:00,400
Don't even think about it.

1724
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:02,520
You will rot in jail
for the rest of your life..

1725
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:04,520
And no one will ever have a clue.

1726
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:06,810
And what do you think the police..

1727
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:08,650
Are going to try as hard as you,
to find her house?

1728
02:01:08,810 --> 02:01:10,060
They will look for a day or two..

1729
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:12,900
...and then they will
send Munnni to some orphanage.

1730
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:15,360
I won't let that happen.

1731
02:01:15,650 --> 02:01:17,610
I promised Bajrang Bali..

1732
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:19,650
...that I will take Munni home.

1733
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,900
And I will.

1734
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:27,270
Listen..
- I can clearly say that..

1735
02:01:27,270 --> 02:01:29,310
I challenge all of you..

1736
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:31,270
There is one way to help you.

1737
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:34,770
TV!

1738
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:36,310
TV?

1739
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:37,690
There is no weight in the story.

1740
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,060
What are you saying, sir?

1741
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:43,270
An Indian is helping
a Pakistani mute girl.

1742
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:45,150
According to me it's
an explosive story.

1743
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:48,810
No, but your story
on the spy was much better.

1744
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:49,650
What about that?

1745
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:53,060
But, sir, he's not a spy.
- That's that, then.

1746
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:54,690
Goodbye.

1747
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:56,060
Hello. Hello.

1748
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:57,230
Sir..

1749
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:04,400
What's the point
of showing this story?

1750
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:07,440
A child will be re-united
with her parents.

1751
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,650
Reunite with her parents?

1752
02:02:08,810 --> 02:02:11,400
Look, we sell news..

1753
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:13,440
...this is not Hazrat
Amin Shah's shrine..

1754
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:14,650
Where we re-unite the separated.

1755
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:16,770
But, sir..
- Goodbye then.

1756
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:18,900
Hello.

1757
02:02:24,150 --> 02:02:26,650
Hatred is easy to sell.

1758
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,610
But love..

1759
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:32,650
What is Hazrat Amin Shah's shrine?

1760
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,310
It's a famous shrine.

1761
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:38,360
It's said that everyone's
wishes get fulfilled there.

1762
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:41,610
Why haven't we gone there yet?
- I see.

1763
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,690
Every time you see a shrine or mosque,
you turn pale.

1764
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:46,270
Remember when we
were in Alipur mosque.

1765
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:48,270
You ran like you had seen a ghost.

1766
02:02:57,650 --> 02:03:00,400
I am willing to go
to any shrine for Munni.

1767
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:02,980
Then let's catch a bus tonight.

1768
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:06,650
It's ringing.

1769
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:14,770
Kaamil.
- Hello, brother Chand.

1770
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:16,310
Thank God. I was worried for you.

1771
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:17,400
Where are you?

1772
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:21,270
Is there anyone around you?
- No. There's no one.

1773
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:22,770
Where are you? With that spy?

1774
02:03:23,190 --> 02:03:25,690
He's not a spy. He's a very nice man.

1775
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:27,020
What do you mean by he's not a spy?

1776
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,900
He only came here
to bring a girl home.

1777
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:32,650
But where are you now?

1778
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:34,730
We're going to Hazrat
Amin Shah's shrine.

1779
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:38,560
It's said that everyone's
wishes get fulfilled there.

1780
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:41,020
Okay, brother, take care.
Goodbye.

1781
02:03:41,190 --> 02:03:41,900
Come on.

1782
02:03:43,690 --> 02:03:52,020
"He comes to Your threshold
with a heavy heart."

1783
02:03:53,020 --> 02:04:01,650
"O Prophet,
you beckon anyone you want."

1784
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:11,020
"I've come to thee
with my head bowed."

1785
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:17,650
"if you're willing,
you can make all wrongs...rights"

1786
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,980
Go on, I'll join you.

1787
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:22,270
Where are you going?

1788
02:04:33,650 --> 02:04:37,610
"Fulfill my wishes, O Mohammad."

1789
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:41,730
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1790
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:46,400
"Fulfill my wishes, O Mohammad."

1791
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:50,360
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1792
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:55,020
"Fulfill my wishes, O Mohammad."

1793
02:04:55,310 --> 02:04:59,480
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1794
02:04:59,770 --> 02:05:03,860
"Fulfill my wishes, O Mohammad."

1795
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:08,150
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1796
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:12,650
"My eyes are filled with tears."

1797
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:16,770
"And my heart's full of sorrows."

1798
02:05:17,190 --> 02:05:21,020
"My eyes are filled with tears."

1799
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:23,650
"And my heart's full of sorrows."

1800
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:25,610
Move aside...move aside

1801
02:05:28,270 --> 02:05:29,310
Greetings.

1802
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:30,690
This is Chand Nawab.

1803
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:33,150
And today I am going
to tell you about a man..

1804
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:35,270
...who entered our
country without a visa..

1805
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:39,520
...by crawling under the border fences,
and his name is Bajrangi."

1806
02:05:39,690 --> 02:05:42,770
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1807
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:45,650
"Fulfill my wishes..
- O Lord."

1808
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:47,690
"Fulfill my wishes..
- Everyone's."

1809
02:05:47,690 --> 02:05:50,150
"Fulfill my wishes..
- 0 Prophet."

1810
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:54,270
"Fulfill my wishes,
O benevolent master."

1811
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:58,270
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1812
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:01,190
Just like the police,
even I believed..

1813
02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:02,900
...that this man is an Indian spy.

1814
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:06,770
But now...l know he is not a spy.

1815
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,400
Then who is he?

1816
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:11,650
Why did he come to our country?
What does he want?

1817
02:06:11,650 --> 02:06:13,900
Bajrangi is a common
man like you and me..

1818
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:16,520
...and he has just one
motive for coming here.

1819
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:17,650
Love.

1820
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:21,520
His love for a 6 year
old Pakistani mute girl..

1821
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:24,520
...who got separated
from her parents in India.

1822
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:26,520
When all other options failed..

1823
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:30,150
...Bajrangi had only this one option
left to reunite her with her parents.

1824
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:37,610
"Look at what's happened to me.."

1825
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:41,860
"..while searching for you,
0 Prophet."

1826
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:46,360
"Look at what's happened to me.."

1827
02:06:46,650 --> 02:06:50,400
"..while searching for you,
0 Prophet."

1828
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:53,060
Every channel has refused
to show this story.

1829
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:55,440
They say it's nonsense.

1830
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,650
No one's interested in it.

1831
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:01,270
So please help Bajrangi Bhaijaan..

1832
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:05,150
...so that he can take this kid home,
and return to his country..

1833
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:06,770
...safe and sound.

1834
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:12,690
"Console my heart, O Prophet."

1835
02:07:12,690 --> 02:07:17,020
"I've come from far...with
great expectations."

1836
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:21,150
"Console my heart, O Prophet."

1837
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:25,520
"I've come from far...with
great expectations."

1838
02:07:25,810 --> 02:07:29,020
"Bless me with your grace as well."

1839
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:30,730
"Until you.."

1840
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:35,610
"Until you...don't answer my prayers."

1841
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:39,730
"I won't leave your threshold."

1842
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:44,360
"Fulfill my wishes,
O benevolent master."

1843
02:07:44,690 --> 02:07:48,650
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1844
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:53,150
"Fulfill my wishes, O Mohammad."

1845
02:07:53,150 --> 02:07:56,860
"I won't go back empty-handed."

1846
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:27,900
"You know what's in my heart."

1847
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:32,480
"You've been counting heartbeats."

1848
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:36,770
"You know what's in my heart."

1849
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:41,270
"You've been counting heartbeats."

1850
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:45,400
"My sighs will reach the moon."

1851
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:49,650
"Your stars will answer my prayers."

1852
02:08:49,810 --> 02:08:53,900
"My sighs will reach the moon."

1853
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:58,520
"Your stars will answer my prayers."

1854
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:02,900
"Someday the dawn will come,
O Prophet."

1855
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:07,400
"Until you...don't answer my prayers."

1856
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:11,150
"I won't leave your threshold."

1857
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:16,020
"Fulfill my wishes,
O benevolent master."

1858
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:19,900
"I won't go back empty-handed."

Call him.

1878
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:09,690
He's brought the police along.
Come here.

1879
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:12,690

He isn't answering.

1883
02:10:18,810 --> 02:10:19,900
Answer the phone.

1884
02:10:21,690 --> 02:10:23,150
Answer the phone.
- Why?

1885
02:10:23,150 --> 02:10:24,360
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

1886
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:27,900
He picked it up.
Hello, brother Chand. Are you okay?

1887
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:29,270
Yes.

1888
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:32,520
Did you go to the shrine?
- Yes, I did last night.

1889
02:10:32,690 --> 02:10:34,190
To pray for Munni.

1890
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,560
I see, so where are you now?

1891
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:40,730
Now...we just left for Gojra

1892
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:43,650
You left for Gojra?

1893
02:10:43,810 --> 02:10:47,060
I see.
- Okay, I'll call you later.

1894
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:49,270
Goodbye.
- Take care.

1895
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:53,520
Brother, finally you lied.
- No, I didn't.

1896
02:10:53,690 --> 02:10:56,270
But you made me lie.
- So what?

1897
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:58,650
Haven't you see
Mahabharat on television?

1898
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:00,610
Is it a movie?

1899
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:06,230
Is it a new movie?

1900
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:09,560
If you recognize this girl,
or know anything about her..

1901
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:13,310
...then please leave your
phone number on this website.

1902
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:14,520
We will definitely call you.

1903
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:15,650
With cameraman Chand...

1904
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:17,860
I have put shots of both
of you two in the video.

1905
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,770
The internet is a powerful tool,
brother.

1906
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:22,650
Did anyone leave their number?

1907
02:11:23,690 --> 02:11:26,480
Only a Few people have seen it so far.
It will grow soon.

1908
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:30,770
Munni, do you want to watch?

1909
02:11:30,940 --> 02:11:32,270
Let me rewind it.

1910
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:47,400
Move aside.

1911
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,810
What happened, Munni?

1912
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:49,900
What did you see, Munni?

1913
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:51,270
Rewind. Rewind.

1914
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,610
What happened, Munni?

1915
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:01,400
Pause.Pause.Pause.

1916
02:12:02,770 --> 02:12:04,520
You know her?

1917
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:07,610
Is she your mother?

1918
02:12:09,190 --> 02:12:10,480
Rewind. Rewind.

1919
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,150
Look Chand Bhai, she got off the bus!

1920
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:16,900
What time did that bus arrive?

1921
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:18,900
Around 8:30.

1922
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:22,020
Find out where the
8:30 bus comes from?

1923
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:31,610
It's here. It's here.

1924
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,520
Brother,
where is this bus coming from?

1925
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:41,810
Where do you want to go?

1926
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:43,400
We want to know where
it's coming from?

1927
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,770
You're a strange man.

1928
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:47,650
Strange or not, first tell
us where the bus is coming from?

1929
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:50,060
Jehanabad.

1930
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:52,520
Munni, is your village's
name Jehanabad?

1931
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:59,270
<i>And before that comes Ursa“.</i>

1932
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:00,650
<i>Ursa“.</i>

1933
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:05,690
And before that comes Karimabad.

1934
02:13:05,690 --> 02:13:06,860
Karimabad.

1935
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:09,690
And before that..

1936
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:11,230
District Sultanpur.

1937
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:14,360
District Sultanpur?

1938
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:19,770
Munni, you're from Sultanpur!?

1939
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:21,020
She is from Sultanpur.

1940
02:13:25,690 --> 02:13:27,020
Munni's from Sultanpur.

1941
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:28,650
Munni's from Sultanpur.

1942
02:13:29,190 --> 02:13:30,900
Sultanpur.

1943
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:47,480
Sir.

1944
02:13:50,810 --> 02:13:52,270
Sir, take a look at this video.

1945
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:55,650
Chand Nawab posted
this video yesterday.

1946
02:13:56,020 --> 02:13:58,060
And today I am going to tell you about...

1947
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:59,150
This is just outside the mosque.

1948
02:13:59,310 --> 02:14:00,810
Sir, they never came to Gojra.

1949
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:03,270
We checked all the houses,
offices and shops.

1950
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:04,730
They aren't here.

1951
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:09,020
Send pictures from this video
to all the inspectors in the area.

1952
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:11,310
And stop all vehicles and check them.

1953
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:12,730
Immediately.
- Yes, sir.

1954
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:22,520
Did you spot your village?

1955
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:29,770
Brother.

1956
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:38,150
Listen to me carefully.

1957
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,520
Come on, get down.

1958
02:14:40,690 --> 02:14:42,270
Bring the vehicle forward.

1959
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:45,150
Come on, get down.
- Everyone get in a line.

1960
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:46,230
Come up.

1961
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:47,520
Come up.

1962
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:48,520
Hurry UP-

1963
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:49,610
Come on.

1964
02:14:50,690 --> 02:14:52,270
Go ahead.

1965
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:55,360
Take off your shawl!

1966
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:58,110
Take it off!

1967
02:15:04,940 --> 02:15:06,650
Catch him. That's him.

1968
02:15:10,650 --> 02:15:12,150
Hey wait.

1969
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:23,900
Catch him.
- Come on.

1970
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,400
Where are you running off too?

1971
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:37,190
Surround him.

1972
02:15:37,190 --> 02:15:37,900
Stop.

1973
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:50,150
Catch him.

1974
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:55,400
"Give me your slumber."

1975
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:59,310
"And take my sights."

1976
02:16:59,310 --> 02:17:06,860
"May no one cast an evil eye on you."

1977
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:14,650
"Give me your slumber,
take my sights."

1978
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:21,440
"Your night has
finally seen the dawn."

1979
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:27,900
"Since we met...l feel capable."

1980
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:36,520
"Since we met...l achieved everything."

1981
02:17:36,690 --> 02:17:44,020
"With great difficulty...
the destination became easy."

1982
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:51,650
"Because you're the heartbeat
and I am the heart."

1983
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:04,650
Greetings.

1984
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:06,110
This is Chand Nawab.

1985
02:19:06,270 --> 02:19:08,400
And today I am going
to tell you about a man..

1986
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:10,270
...who entered our
country without a visa..

1987
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:14,520
...by crawling under the border fences,
and his name is Bajrangi."

1988
02:19:14,810 --> 02:19:16,400
Just like the police,
even I believed..

1989
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:17,770
...that this man is an Indian spy.

1990
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:21,400
But now...l know he is not a spy.

1991
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:22,900
Then who is he?

1992
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:24,770
Why did he come to our country?

1993
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:25,770
What does he want?

1994
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:28,150
Bajrangi is a common
man like you and me..

1995
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:31,400
...and he has just one
motive for coming here.

1996
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:32,520
Love.

1997
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:35,610
His love for a 6 year
old Pakistani mute girl..

1998
02:19:36,060 --> 02:19:38,610
...who got separated
from her parents in India.

1999
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:40,690
When all other options failed..

2000
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:44,520
Bajrangi had only this one option left
to reunite her with her parents.

2001
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:47,190
Every channel has refused
to show this story.

2002
02:19:47,190 --> 02:19:48,810
They say it's nonsense.

2003
02:19:48,810 --> 02:19:51,020
No one's interested in it.

2004
02:19:51,810 --> 02:19:53,810
So please help Bajrangi Bhaijaan..

2005
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:57,310
...so that he can take this kid home,
and return to his country..

2006
02:19:57,310 --> 02:19:59,400
...safe and sound.

2007
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:02,150
If you recognize this girl,
or know anything about her..

2008
02:20:02,310 --> 02:20:05,310
...then please paste your
phone number on this website.

2009
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:06,690
We will definitely call you.

2010
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:10,520
This is Chand Nawab,
with cameraman Chand Nawab, Kashmir.

2011
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:37,900
I don't care what the press, the
media and the common man are thinking.

2012
02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:40,770
For us he's an Indian spy.

2013
02:20:40,770 --> 02:20:43,360
But Sir, the child's
parents have confirmed

2014
02:20:43,690 --> 02:20:44,900
that she did get separated in India.

2015
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:46,770
But, sir, the people of Pakistan

2016
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:48,770
...are growing sympathetic towards him.

2017
02:20:50,270 --> 02:20:54,650
So then...tell the press and the media..

2018
02:20:54,810 --> 02:20:58,520
...that he has admitted
that he's an Indian spy.

2019
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:02,520
Then we'll see about
the people's sympathy.

2020
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:12,310
Tell your men to get
information from India quickly.

2021
02:21:12,310 --> 02:21:13,480
Sir.

2022
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:20,520
This child couldn't speak,
I remember that clearly.

2023
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:22,980
Yes, and this man brought her here.

2024
02:21:23,310 --> 02:21:24,770
He was saying she's lost.

2025
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:32,400
Stop it.

2026
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:34,520
Hello.

2027
02:21:34,770 --> 02:21:35,770
Sir, Kurukshetra Police Station..

2028
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:39,440
...and our men at the Delhi
Commission have verified his story.

2029
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:41,520
He did go there with this girl.

2030
02:21:41,810 --> 02:21:43,270
This man can't be a spy.

2031
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:47,400
You don't get to decide who's what

2032
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:48,520
That's my job!

2033
02:21:48,690 --> 02:21:50,770
Your job is to make him confess

2034
02:21:50,770 --> 02:21:52,270
...that he's a spy.
- But, sir..

2035
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:56,400
And yes, if you can't
do this job then tell me now.

2036
02:21:56,770 --> 02:21:59,020
We have other capable officers.

2037
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:01,770
And I think you might need a vacation.

2038
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:15,770
They want Pawan's
confession at any cost.

2039
02:22:19,810 --> 02:22:21,480
All my life I've worked towards..

2040
02:22:21,690 --> 02:22:25,020
...the glory and protection
of this country.

2041
02:22:26,810 --> 02:22:30,860
But if this man..

2042
02:22:34,690 --> 02:22:40,230
If this man is thrown in Pakistani
jail for the rest of his life..

2043
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:44,020
...then that will be against
the glory of our country.

2044
02:22:49,810 --> 02:22:51,480
And I won't let that happen.

2045
02:22:58,440 --> 02:22:59,360
Hello.

2046
02:22:59,690 --> 02:23:00,770
Who?

2047
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:04,150
Hamid sir.

2048
02:23:04,810 --> 02:23:05,770
Yes, sir.

2049
02:23:06,650 --> 02:23:07,480
Yes.

2050
02:23:10,310 --> 02:23:11,270
Yes, sir.

2051
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:14,770
Thank you.

2052
02:23:15,190 --> 02:23:18,150
Very good, sir.

2053
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:19,610
Thank you, sir.

2054
02:23:19,810 --> 02:23:21,060
Get the camera out. Come on.

2055
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:22,270
Get the camera out .

2056
02:23:22,270 --> 02:23:23,360
Come on.

2057
02:23:25,770 --> 02:23:27,730
Sir.

2058
02:23:28,690 --> 02:23:31,400
Sir, there's a new video
on the Bajrangi story.

2059
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:36,480
Okay, roll the bulletin.
- Okay, sir.

2060
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:37,900
Sister Rasika.

2061
02:23:38,060 --> 02:23:39,270
Sister Rasika.

2062
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:42,020
Brother Bajrangi's on television.

2063
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:45,770
Pakistani reporter Chand
Nawab has posted a new video..

2064
02:23:45,770 --> 02:23:48,440
...of Pawan Chaturvedi,
aka Bajrangi Bhaijaan..

2065
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:50,400
...who is locked up in Pakistan jail.

2066
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:59,770
Pawan Chanturvedi,
or better known as Bajrangi Bhaijaan..

2067
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:03,150
...is an Indian who risked
his life to reunite..

2068
02:24:03,150 --> 02:24:07,270
...a small child with
her parents in Pakistan.

2069
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:09,400
Run this story immediately.

2070
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:11,150
Why did Bajrangi do such a thing?

2071
02:24:11,310 --> 02:24:13,900
For money, fame...

2072
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:14,940
No!

2073
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:18,440
Bajrangi did this because
he has a clean and honest heart.

2074
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:22,190
He did it because,
he didn't see Shahida as a Pakistani..

2075
02:24:22,190 --> 02:24:25,610
...but as another human being.

2076
02:24:26,770 --> 02:24:28,770
But unfortunately, this godsent

2077
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:31,520
...is stuck amidst the
hatred between the two countries.

2078
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:34,190
And today,
this hatred has forced Bajrangi..

2079
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:36,860
...to hide like a criminal in Pakistan.

2080
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:39,520
Let's end this hatred now.

2081
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:41,520
And we need to do this.

2082
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:43,770
We the people of both the countries..

2083
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:47,150
...who want to raise our
children with love, not hatred.

2084
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:50,770
So come, let's finish this hatred.

2085
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:54,770
Tomorrow morning...let's together
head towards Narowal Checkpost.

2086
02:24:54,940 --> 02:24:56,020
What nonsense is this?

2087
02:24:56,190 --> 02:24:57,650
Seal the Narowal border.

2088
02:24:57,650 --> 02:25:00,650
Let the people from both the
countries come there and see to it..

2089
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:03,900
...that no one stops Pawan Charutvedi,
my Bajrangi..

2090
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:05,520
...from crossing the border!

2091
02:25:05,690 --> 02:25:07,400
Or stop him from going home.

2092
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:10,020
With cameraman Kamil Yusuf,
this is Chand Nawab.

2093
02:26:48,690 --> 02:26:50,770
Chand...Munni?

2094
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:55,270
Brother, we have fulfilled our
promise made to Bajrang Bali.

2095
02:26:55,810 --> 02:26:56,770
Munni...

2096
02:26:56,940 --> 02:26:58,020
Shahida.

2097
02:26:58,020 --> 02:27:00,150
Shahida is with her parents now.

2098
02:27:01,150 --> 02:27:02,230
Shahida?

2099
02:27:02,810 --> 02:27:05,400
Yes, Shahida.

2100
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:07,770
Shahida.

2101
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:08,900
Pawan.

2102
02:27:09,310 --> 02:27:10,770
Let's go, Pawan.
Come on.

2103
02:27:19,810 --> 02:27:20,650
Come.

2104
02:27:21,690 --> 02:27:23,020
Do come back.

2105
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:27,020
And this time don't
crawl under the fence.

2106
02:27:27,020 --> 02:27:28,650
But with a proper visa.

2107
02:27:29,770 --> 02:27:30,650
I promise.

2108
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,520
Come on.

2109
02:27:34,310 --> 02:27:36,400
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2110
02:27:36,690 --> 02:27:44,520
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2111
02:27:44,690 --> 02:27:45,770
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2112
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:48,520
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2113
02:27:48,690 --> 02:27:49,770
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2114
02:27:49,940 --> 02:27:52,770
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2115
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:57,900
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2116
02:27:58,060 --> 02:28:01,810
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2117
02:28:01,810 --> 02:28:02,810
Stop.

2118
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:03,810
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2119
02:28:03,810 --> 02:28:04,770
Open the gate.

2120
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:07,690
Sir, we have orders to arrest you.

2121
02:28:07,690 --> 02:28:09,230
If this man had risked his life..

2122
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:14,770
...to bring back your lost child,
wouldn't you have opened the gate?

2123
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:17,650
You know...l can't open the gate.

2124
02:28:17,650 --> 02:28:22,520
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2125
02:28:22,690 --> 02:28:24,150
Do you hear these voices?

2126
02:28:24,310 --> 02:28:25,650
Bajrangi Bhaijaan!

2127
02:28:25,650 --> 02:28:27,360
It's the voice of
the people of Pakistan.

2128
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:30,650
If they can see the difference
between right and wrong..

2129
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:31,690
...then why can't you?

2130
02:28:31,690 --> 02:28:32,770
You're a soldier.

2131
02:28:33,310 --> 02:28:35,270
You know better.

2132
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:37,020
We have orders, sir.

2133
