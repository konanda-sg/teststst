1
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:29,259
Some people have money
written in their fate.

2
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:31,052
For some, it's love.

3
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,259
For some, fame.

4
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:34,802
Hey, Champak!

5
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:36,968
What are you doing?

6
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:41,259
I'm wondering whether I should
play on my front foot or back?

7
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:49,593
But in my fate was written...

8
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,052
Confusion!

9
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,093
Champak, what will you
become when you grow up?

10
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,759
Inspector?

11
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,218
Bandit?

12
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,052
Lawyer?

13
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,843
I was so confused...

14
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:16,177
...that it was easier to remember
the moments when I wasn't confused.

15
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:21,759
And these rare moments
occurred only thrice in my life...

16
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:24,427
The first time was when I saw Rashi.

17
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,468
I had no confusion at all.

18
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,384
I want to continue
studying after marriage.

19
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:33,259
I'll buy you the books you want.

20
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,177
No, I mean a post-graduation degree.

21
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,052
What for?

22
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,052
We have a sweet shop.

23
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:45,968
You can be the boss there.

24
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:54,134
The second time was when
I held my daughter in my arms.

25
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,427
I had no confusion at all.

26
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,009
Don't worry...

27
00:03:58,093 --> 00:03:59,843
...It'll be a boy next time.

28
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,843
I always wanted a daughter.

29
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:05,677
I only wished for
her to be like Rashi.

30
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:12,177
But Rashi passed on and
once again I was confused

31
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:16,971
Whether to be the girl's father,
mother or friend.

32
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,014
What should I be?

33
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:22,302
Papa, shall I use
a hairclip or a hairband?

34
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:24,093
Hairband.

35
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,052
That pulls my hair

36
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:27,718
Then the hairclip?

37
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,343
I don't like clips.

38
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:39,468
Papa, when will we
go see the Eiffel Tower?

39
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:41,343
Dreams are of two kinds.

40
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:45,677
Some that fade away like
mine of becoming a cricketer.

41
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,093
We'll go, we'll go.

42
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:50,014
And some end up becoming
the ultimate goal of one's life....

43
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,593
...like Taru's obsession
of going to a foreign country.

44
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:54,510
It was beyond me.

45
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,260
- Papa?
- Yes darling?

46
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:59,177
When will we go meet the Queen?

47
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,093
We'll go, we'll go.

48
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:05,468
- Papa?
- Yeah?

49
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:07,885
When will we go to Hollywood?

50
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,593
We'll go, we'll go.

51
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,385
But when?

52
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:13,343
When you grow up. C'mon.

53
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,260
Silence.

54
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:17,760
C'mon. Let's go.

55
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,677
I didn't think then that
one day she'd grow up.

56
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,510
And her mad obsession
would be the third time

57
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:26,635
when I would have no confusion...

58
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:29,968
What was unimaginable
was the bizarre journey...

59
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,593
...I would have to
undertake to get there.

60
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,385
Hello...

61
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:55,302
Good morning.

62
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:03,093
Why don't you open your shop on time?

63
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:05,260
Why don't you mind your own business?

64
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:06,385
Hail Lord Ram!

65
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,802
None of you are worth
using the family name.

66
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:17,014
Excuse me, is this the GHA-SI-TE-RAM?

67
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,593
Yes. Yes. First original Ghasiteram.

68
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,218
What's first original?

69
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:24,135
This is first original.

70
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,468
Oh, this shop.

71
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,718
Mr. Foreigner! Mr. Foreigner!

72
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:30,427
That is a fake one.

73
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,802
This is the original one.
He's lying.

74
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:36,385
I'm not lying, he is.

75
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:39,343
- Check the Lonely Planet.
- This is my shop.

76
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:41,218
- Oh, this
- Come on in.

77
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:42,968
Hot oil trick!

78
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:45,343
Hot oil trick!

79
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,302
Hot oil trick!

80
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:51,677
That's no trick...

81
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,052
I can do it too, let me show you.
This way, please.

82
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,718
- This is the original one.
- No, no.

83
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:03,927
You'll come again and again. Try it.

84
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,343
No, not from his hands.
His hands are dirty.

85
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:15,227
You'll get diarrhea, hepatitis...
or maybe die.

86
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,510
You called my sweets shit?

87
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,302
I said your hands have shit on them

88
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:22,014
You called my sweets shit!

89
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,971
Now try your trick on him. Go ahead.

90
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:26,427
- Not like the shit you make.
- Go, get your act together.

91
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,760
These cheap tricks won't help you

92
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,093
Go dip your head in it.

93
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:31,635
What the...

94
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:35,218
Champak,
isn't that Gajodhar's son, Ankit?

95
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:36,927
What's he doing there?

96
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:39,760
That bloody...

97
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,385
Try it.

98
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,343
What are you upto, Bheluram?

99
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:52,677
Mind your own business...

100
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,177
You can't even handle a customer.

101
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,218
Atleast I have customers.

102
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,052
Why don't you mind your own business,
you're not getting any, clearly.

103
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,010
I have customers coming
from all over the world.

104
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:03,677
Why don't you sell me Ghasiteram?

105
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,177
I'll make it an International brand.

106
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,135
No thanks. We have too
many branches in Rajasthan.

107
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:09,510
Need to shut some down.

108
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:12,343
Listen, you are a Chandiram
and that's all you will be.

109
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:16,014
However big you make your shop,
you can't be a Ghasiteram.

110
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:18,510
Because I'm the only
Ghasiteram, get it?

111
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,593
You come with me.

112
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,760
You really think you
can buy the Ghasiteram name?

113
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:29,302
Seriously?

114
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:34,052
Son, however much we
fight within our family,

115
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:38,302
we will never do
business with Chandiram...

116
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,260
Where are you going?

117
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:40,385
Where are you running off to?

118
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:41,093
Huh...

119
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:44,013
What were you doing at Chandiram's?

120
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,010
He gave me a decent offer.

121
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,013
I'll give you one rap,

122
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,843
and if your father found
out he'd give you another.

123
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,718
You're not the only Ghasiteram.

124
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,013
I'm also one.

125
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,385
He was my great grandfather.

126
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,885
I'll do whatever I want

127
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,013
Wow! You'll do whatever you want?

128
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,802
Aah.. Uncle, it hurts.

129
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,177
Hello grandpa.

130
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:05,177
Grandpa, please keep your glasses on
or everyone will get conjunctivitis.

131
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,635
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

132
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:07,927
- Let's go.
- Aah.. Uncle.

133
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:10,677
Look at this, our family tree.

134
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:14,052
You'll find everyone's
photo here except Chandiram's.

135
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:15,135
Do you know why?

136
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,593
He didn't like being photographed?

137
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:18,885
No, you idiot.

138
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:19,885
Listen...

139
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:24,968
Once upon a time in 1920...

140
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:29,013
A ruthless British officer
got a craving for Indian sweets

141
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,885
in the middle of the night
and wondered where to go.

142
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:37,093
He landed up at Ghasiteram's

143
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:41,427
...but our great grandfather
did not let him set foot in the shop.

144
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,677
He kicked him out.

145
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:45,427
And do you know what he said?

146
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:48,010
- What did he say?
- What?

147
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,593
Oi my foreign brother...

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
It's my business to sell sweets...

149
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:53,593
...but my loyalty to the
country is not for sale.

150
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,135
- Woah! What a line!
- Bravo.

151
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,927
Yeah but his brother
Chandiram was an ass-licker.

152
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,385
He took the British to his shop and
fed them all the sweets they wanted.

153
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,052
That's why there's no
place for him in this house!

154
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,927
And look at you, your great
grandfather would be ashamed of you.

155
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,635
The court date is out,
you're coming right?

156
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,718
Of course, no doubt.

157
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:14,760
C'mon get going.

158
00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:40,093
Studying?

159
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,093
Is this the wrong house?

160
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:44,052
Where's my daughter Taru?

161
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,177
Go on, you also make fun of me.

162
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,677
Who else made fun of my daughter?

163
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,093
The Principal.

164
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:57,843
Don't talk about that witch.

165
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,218
Never gives a single day off...

166
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:01,718
We could never go for
any of the family weddings

167
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,635
And now she won't let me go to the UK.

168
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,093
UK? Uttarakhand?

169
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:09,052
Not Uttarakhand Papa,
the United Kingdom, England.

170
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:12,677
Our school has a tie
up with Truford University.

171
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:17,093
The top 3 rankers will
get a placement there.

172
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,968
I went to the Principal
asking for details...

173
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,260
...and she told me
not to stress about it,...

174
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,760
...only if 30 kids don't want to go,
you might get a chance.

175
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,052
Okay.

176
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:34,135
Tell me the part where
she made fun of you.

177
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:42,677
She wasn't making fun of you Taru.
That is the truth.

178
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,593
You've never got above 50 percent.

179
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:46,635
Do you know how much you've got to
score to get a top rank?

180
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:47,927
Ninety.

181
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:50,385
It's not a parliamentary election. You
can't steal extra ministers from...

182
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:51,843
...another party if
you don't win by majority.

183
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,927
You have to earn it all by yourself.

184
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:55,385
Let it go, forget about it!

185
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,593
Listen.

186
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,718
Listen to me.

187
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:04,718
There's a sale on at the night market.

188
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,718
Let's go shopping.

189
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:08,971
Papa, I'm talking to
you about something important.

190
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,218
Why are you changing the topic?

191
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:12,052
Because this topic needs changing.

192
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,135
Papa, I've decided.
I am going to London.

193
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:22,385
Why don't you go to Jaipur if you
just want to get out of here?

194
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:23,843
Your aunt has a house there.

195
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,177
I could also come and stay with you.

196
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:27,385
Papa, why do I have to stay with you?

197
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:30,218
I've grown up.
Give me a little freedom atleast.

198
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:36,760
It took India 200 years
to get freedom from the British.

199
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,802
You can wait till you turn 18 atleast.

200
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,093
And what's so great about London?
The British came running here.

201
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,971
We had to kick them out.

202
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,843
They have quality of life, Papa.

203
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,343
We have that here.

204
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,635
Every morning the
milkman delivers milk.

205
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:52,052
Someone clears up our trash.
The maid does the dishes.

206
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,427
What more quality do you want?

207
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:57,385
That is called
exploitation of the poor.

208
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:58,135
What?

209
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:00,177
Quality of life is different,
this is exploitation.

210
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,013
You're confusing me.

211
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:04,968
- Let's just drop it.
- Don't confuse me.

212
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,013
- I am not confusing you.
- Don't confuse me.

213
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:09,010
Okay, okay. We'll go, we'll go.

214
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:10,802
You've only been saying, "We'll go,
we'll go"!

215
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,927
Now when I'm getting a chance,
let me go.

216
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,135
Will you be able to live without me?

217
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,677
Now you're blackmailing me emotionally,
don't digress and promise me.

218
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,927
You can't score 90
percent without cheating.

219
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,718
If you're so sure
of it then promise me.

220
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:38,135
I...

221
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,593
I'll work hard, papa.

222
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:46,135
I swear on mum.

223
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:50,052
If I work hard and get it,
will you let me go then?

224
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:52,468
Okay. If you manage to earn it,
I will drop you to London myself.

225
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:56,718
Really? Promise me.

226
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:59,677
Promise. Alright?

227
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,218
Okay, now go get your marks.
I'm hungry.

228
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,218
Go now.

229
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:11,135
Miss, lay the table.

230
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:15,760
I will have one passion
fruit mojito with crushed ice.

231
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:17,635
Ma'am, it has rum mixed in it.

232
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:18,843
I know.

233
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:19,802
Sorry.

234
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,843
- Enjoy your meal ma'am.
- Thank you.

235
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:26,468
What happened to you, Taru?

236
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,260
When did you start drinking?

237
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,302
Habit...I'm cultivating the habit.

238
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:33,177
Habit.

239
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:40,052
It's not funny. You just
have to develop a taste for it.

240
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:44,802
When my friends in London
offer me vodka shots...

241
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,427
India's reputation will be at stake.

242
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,971
Wow! You're the only true patriot.

243
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:50,510
India's proud of you, Taru.

244
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,677
Cheers

245
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,052
Cheers!

246
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,677
Where were you?
I've been trying your number.

247
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:20,427
I was at Maya's house, studying.

248
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,593
Where are your books?

249
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,343
I don't see any books.

250
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,302
Why are you up so late?

251
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:40,593
Late?

252
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:42,971
Its only 9.

253
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,052
- Have you been drinking?
- What?

254
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,718
I can tell from your eyes.

255
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,718
Let's not go there.

256
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:51,971
Your mother used to tell me,
my eyes are intoxicating.

257
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,218
You're missing mum. That means
you've definitely been drinking.

258
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:57,093
- That's not good.
- No. I have fixed days for that.

259
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:59,802
Thursday, Friday and bank holidays.
That's it.

260
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,968
You don't believe me?

261
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,093
Check my breath.

262
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,093
Where is the smell
of alcohol coming from?

263
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:15,885
I drank 3 days ago.

264
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,135
Are you saying, I've been drinking?

265
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:21,760
No. I didn't say that.

266
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:23,302
Since you can smell it,
somebody has been drinking...

267
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:24,468
...which means you have been drinking.

268
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:25,593
Prove me wrong.

269
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,802
Walk in a straight
line with your eyes shut.

270
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,177
You're one hell of a taskmaster!

271
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,971
Even the cops don't make you do that.

272
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,468
Walk in a straight line, papa...

273
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,343
Walk with...

274
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,343
...with my eyes shut...

275
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,968
- a straight line, right now.
- I've closed my eyes.

276
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,218
Which way?

277
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,302
Not this way, go that way.

278
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:41,968
C'mon.

279
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:43,052
There you go, eyes closed.

280
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,093
Here, I am walking straight.

281
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,052
There you go. Happy?

282
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,052
Okay.

283
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,927
Here, I can even walk backwards.

284
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,052
Shall I turn around?

285
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,427
Good boy, Papa.

286
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:00,968
Now go to your room and sleep.

287
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:03,971
I'm supposed to say that, silly girl.
I'm your father.

288
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,052
Okay. Goodnight.

289
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,843
Okay, very goodnight!

290
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,052
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hurry up. Come on.

291
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:20,718
That fool's also coming along.

292
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:21,427
Come on.

293
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:22,510
Come on, let's go.

294
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,677
Oi Champak!

295
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,843
Champak, first please
let's sort out my payment...

296
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:29,218
...otherwise my bus is not moving.

297
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:32,635
Hey. Talk with respect, first.

298
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,635
Get out of the way!

299
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,593
-Hello. Hello.
-We give you so much business.

300
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:36,843
That is the problem.

301
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,177
You give me business
but you never pay for it.

302
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:40,885
What?

303
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,010
Really?

304
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:45,968
Listen up, all.

305
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:48,802
Whoever hasn't cleared Gajju's bills,
his old ones,

306
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:51,635
his future ones, for this bus,
please pay him all his dues.

307
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:52,885
- Are you happy now?
- Yeah.

308
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:53,468
Shall we?

309
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,927
- Will you clear my dues for sure?
- Will you let us leave for now?

310
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,843
Driver, take them.

311
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:09,014
How are your studies going?

312
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:11,093
Superb! Studies are going superbly.
You don't worry.

313
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:13,052
- They're going well, uncle.
- They're going well, right?

314
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,177
She started studying
only two days ago.

315
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,718
Ignore him.

316
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:22,014
If you need any help, let me know.

317
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:22,972
Don't worry.

318
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,468
As much as I hate your father,
I will always love you.

319
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,885
Today, I'll make sure you retire.

320
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:35,468
Your Ghasiteram sweet
shop is going to be shut down.

321
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:39,343
You see that. He's provoking me.

322
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,635
- Ignore him.
- What? What are you talking about?

323
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,760
All rise!
The Honourable Judge is arriving.

324
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:02,968
Case number 432/1, 336/1.

325
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:08,014
Champak Bansal from Udaipur versus
Gopi Bansal versus Lagnesh Bansal-

326
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,302
Hold on.

327
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,635
This endless list of names has
been taking up all the time so far.

328
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,052
Let's move on with the proceedings.

329
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:15,343
Yes...

330
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:18,593
Sir, people from all over
Rajasthan have come here today.

331
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:19,972
There's one from
almost every district.

332
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:23,052
You can refer to this family
tree to avoid any confusion.

333
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,593
Out of court settle-

334
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,885
Settle down you guys
and let the case begin.

335
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,802
Stop this chatter.
You are in a courtroom.

336
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:42,343
You also settle down and stop being
a nuisance, the judge is waiting.

337
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:46,005
Last time I had recommended
an out of court settlement.

338
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:47,885
Did you all manage
to meet and sort it out?

339
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:49,972
Your honor, if I may... Let me speak.

340
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:51,843
Your honor,
I'll tell you what happened.

341
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:56,010
You asked us to have a
meeting so we decided to meet.

342
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:57,218
Everyone came.

343
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:01,510
Now he said, I should get
the booze and he'll get the snacks.

344
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:05,593
Do you know, what he got as snacks?

345
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,343
Am I here to discuss snacks?

346
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:12,052
My lord, my lord,
let's talk about the booze first.

347
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,972
It was Lagnesh's
turn to get the booze.

348
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:16,468
- My turn?
- Yes, you.

349
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:18,510
Do you know what he did?

350
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,927
He got country liquor
in a bottle of Scotch.

351
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,260
He's talking about the snacks bro.

352
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,972
Country liquor causes so much acidity...

353
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:27,968
...I couldn't drink for three days.

354
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:29,972
We are not talking about the booze.
We're talking about the snacks.

355
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:31,468
I'm still getting an acid reflux.

356
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:33,260
If it wasn't for the snacks

357
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:34,593
we could've settled the matter.

358
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:39,052
- Order, order
- Tell him what you got as snacks.

359
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:39,885
I brought...

360
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:40,927
What did I bring?

361
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,843
It was by mistake.
I got fish eggs, accidentally.

362
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,927
Really? You got fish eggs?

363
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,177
That day you told us they were sweets.

364
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:51,510
I didn't intend to...
- Order! Order.

365
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:53,468
We're not discussing the snacks.

366
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:55,968
- He brought booze, and I...
- It's not about the booze...

367
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:57,510
- It was his turn
- Order!

368
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:01,093
- You're such a...
- Order, order

369
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,052
Maintain the decorum of the court.

370
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,468
Do you wish to say anything?

371
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,802
Sir, I've been drinking
country liquor since my childhood.

372
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,010
It never caused me acidity.

373
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:14,802
We're not talking about the booze.
We're talking about the snacks.

374
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:16,014
Suits you but doesn't suit us.

375
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:17,218
That's impossible.

376
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:19,302
Shut up! Shut up!

377
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,052
The judgement has been made.

378
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:24,052
I'm announcing the verdict.

379
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:30,843
Going by Late Mr. Ghasiteram's will,

380
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:33,093
which he couldn't sign
before breathing his last,

381
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:39,343
the court grants Gopi Bansal,
son of Shyamlal Bansal

382
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:43,968
and his family the exclusive
rights to the family name.

383
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:47,385
If the name is used for a commercial
purpose by any other party,

384
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,510
it will be deemed illegal and
considered a punishable offence by law.

385
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:57,052
How can a will without
a signature be valid?

386
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,260
This is Gopi's conspiracy.

387
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:01,468
Gopi is innocent. Stop blaming him.

388
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:03,468
This verdict isn't fair.

389
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:05,677
We'll appeal to the higher court.

390
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:09,843
Shut your trap.

391
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:11,968
The judge is a fraud.

392
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:15,052
The judge is corrupt.

393
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:38,593
"Love's become a trade."

394
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:45,218
"Only money can buy you love."

395
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:50,052
Atleast, return the
bail money I paid for you.

396
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:52,885
You're like family, Gajju.

397
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:55,093
It's all yours after we're gone.

398
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,010
Except for the name, Ghasiteram.

399
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:02,510
I've already lost a pair of slippers,
otherwise I'd whack you with another one.

400
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:04,052
No, Champak.

401
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,343
You know the rule.

402
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,718
No fighting when we're drinking.
We're all buddies here.

403
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:11,010
I feel so disappointed in myself.

404
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:14,802
I'd stooped so low
for the sake of this name.

405
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:17,302
I got Gopi's shop raided.

406
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,593
You did that?

407
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:20,718
Yes, I did.

408
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:23,927
You want to hit me?

409
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,468
Hit me.

410
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:36,593
Champak, you have no
idea of things I've done.

411
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:39,218
You too? What exactly do you mean?

412
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,302
What? Who?

413
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,885
I don't know. What did you do?

414
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,260
Who did what?

415
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:45,885
I bribed the municipality.

416
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,677
I made them dig the entire
path around your shop.

417
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:54,218
Not a single customer could
get to his shop for 3 days.

418
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:57,385
How could you stoop so low?

419
00:23:58,093 --> 00:23:59,972
He's your cousin. Man, that's nasty.

420
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,677
Hey. He's my brother.

421
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,972
Champak! Champak...

422
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,593
Champak...

423
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,927
It's okay. It's alright.

424
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,302
Sit down. Sit!

425
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,052
He's my brother.

426
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:12,760
He can do whatever he wishes to.

427
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:15,135
Champak, did you hear what he said?

428
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,093
You're my brother.

429
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:20,927
You can do whatever you want.

430
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,843
You're my brother and you're
a far better man than me.

431
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:35,010
He whisked the catering deal for
Chauhan's wedding from under my nose.

432
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,843
That is my expertise bro,

433
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:43,260
but the sweets I made
for the wedding got stolen.

434
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:46,093
All of it.

435
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:47,468
I stole them.

436
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:48,343
What?

437
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,385
I swear, I stole them.

438
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,972
- Nah.
- I swear.

439
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:55,510
Are you serious?
Gopi got quite a thrashing for that.

440
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:57,510
They beat him up for two long hours...

441
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:01,302
And the two of you
stood there watching?

442
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:03,052
Why didn't you come save me?

443
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,968
I had to sell
the sweets I stole from you.

444
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,760
Right. Makes sense.

445
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,260
It's a neck-to-neck competition.

446
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:16,052
That's nothing.

447
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:21,760
You can't imagine the extent to which
I've gone even in your wildest dreams.

448
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,135
Is it? What did you do?

449
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:24,802
I bribed the judge.

450
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:28,135
I got him a Rolex
worth 900,000 rupees.

451
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,972
- What? Really?
- You gotta be kidding.

452
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,468
- I'm not kidding. It's true.
- That can't be.

453
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:35,014
Yes. Hang on. Look at this.

454
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:36,218
Show it to me.

455
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,468
Rolex for nine hundred
thousand rupees.

456
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:47,968
Forgive me, Champak.
You're my brother.

457
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:50,093
I'll never do such a thing again.

458
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,385
You're the only true Ghasiteram.

459
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,802
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

460
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:56,052
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

461
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:59,177
I am giving you the permission.

462
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:04,093
Do not remove the Ghasiteram
board from your shop.

463
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:07,385
Remove it! Remove the board!

464
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:11,052
All boards should've been taken
down by 9am, as per the court order.

465
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,302
It's 5 past 9.

466
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,052
Take it down.

467
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:18,885
Can't you see, it is being taken down.

468
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:20,218
It's 5 minutes past 9.

469
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,593
Every other board must go.

470
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:23,677
You're right.

471
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:30,010
Grab it and yank it off.

472
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:32,052
Useless!

473
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,385
Take it down.

474
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:51,363
So shall we start tomorrow?

475
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:53,697
Huh?

476
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,613
Exam prep!
I have to rank in top 3.

477
00:26:57,363 --> 00:26:58,697
I don't get it.

478
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,905
You're helping me, right?

479
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:03,655
I have to be among top 3 students
to get to Truford University.

480
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,613
Don't you pay attention in class?

481
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:12,238
I'll pick you up from
the coaching class tomorrow.

482
00:27:12,322 --> 00:27:13,905
We'll go to my place and get started.

483
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:15,572
And when will I study?

484
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:17,616
You've been a topper.
Why do you need to study?

485
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,738
You're helping me study, right?

486
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,905
No.

487
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,947
Look Anmol, I've taken
up a challenge and I must win it.

488
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,905
I'll pick you up after
the coaching class tomorrow.

489
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:26,780
Please bring these books along.

490
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,572
- Thank you.
- But...

491
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:39,322
Hello

492
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:44,072
"I will fly across the clouds."

493
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:48,572
"And I will sing to my own tune."

494
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:52,780
"All my crazy, crazy dreams."

495
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:57,238
"I make into my one desire."

496
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:02,030
"I know I don't belong here."

497
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,697
"I need to make my own life."

498
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:09,572
"I've got one life."

499
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:14,113
"with hundreds of dreams."

500
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:18,072
You'll have to learn
these two diagrams.

501
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:33,616
Papa!

502
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:36,405
"So many obstacles in my path"

503
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:38,322
"And so many battles to fight."

504
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:40,697
"But my heart beats with hope."

505
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,405
"Ain't that right?"

506
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:45,072
"Life is a bit hard."

507
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:46,988
"Who knows what the
future holds for me."

508
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,322
"But I'm no less than a star."

509
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:51,113
"Ain't that right?"

510
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:55,280
"I know I don't belong here."

511
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:58,947
"I need to make my own life."

512
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:10,738
"One Life."

513
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:13,530
"Hundreds of dreams"

514
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:16,738
"I shall make them all come true."

515
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:19,572
"I got one life"

516
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,780
"And hundreds of dreams"

517
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:26,030
"And each and every
one will come true"

518
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:30,988
"I shall make them all come true"

519
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:39,572
Is this a new one?

520
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,197
You might be the first ever father...

521
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,113
...who is bothered by
his daughter studying so hard?

522
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:47,738
Why would I be bothered
by her studying?

523
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:50,072
You're not getting it Gajju.

524
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:51,988
Why don't you use a bit of your brain?

525
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,947
Taru wants to go
to London at any cost.

526
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,822
It's only London. Not Mars.

527
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:04,030
London.

528
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,363
You're confusing me now.

529
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:09,947
You've been confused since birth.

530
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:14,780
Look, if she gets the marks,
I'll have to send her away.

531
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:17,447
I can't let that happen...

532
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,280
...but after studying so hard,
if she doesn't...

533
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,405
...she'll be heartbroken.

534
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:26,780
That'll be the end of her dream.

535
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:29,613
Gajju.

536
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,822
What kind of a guy are you?

537
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:35,697
You are confusing me too.

538
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:38,738
Think Gajju, think.

539
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,447
Please think.

540
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:44,363
I am thinking.

541
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:53,280
Here.

542
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,613
What's this?

543
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:56,822
Your examination paper.

544
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:58,405
You've been working so hard.

545
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:00,030
You can't trust the teachers
to give you the marks you deserve.

546
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,405
Take the question
paper and get full marks.

547
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,988
How did you get the question paper?

548
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,363
That's not important.

549
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:09,863
You've been studying so sincerely.

550
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,988
Take it.

551
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:18,905
Look at it and get the marks.

552
00:31:19,072 --> 00:31:22,280
No, papa. I've sworn on mum.

553
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,113
I'll go to London only
if I earn it honestly.

554
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:26,905
Otherwise I won't.

555
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:29,905
Take a look

556
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,072
No, papa.

557
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,988
Give it a glance.
There's no harm in it.

558
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:35,655
No, papa. Let it be.

559
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,655
I won't tell anyone.

560
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:39,655
No, papa.

561
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:42,697
Alright then.

562
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,155
"So many obstacles in your path."

563
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:13,113
"And so many battles to fight."

564
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,405
"But your heart beats with hope."

565
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:17,697
"Ain't that right?"

566
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:19,863
"Your life is a bit hard."

567
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,863
"Who knows what the
future holds for you."

568
00:32:21,947 --> 00:32:24,280
"But you're no less than a star."

569
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:26,155
"Ain't that right?"

570
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:30,072
"I know I don't belong here."

571
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:33,822
"I need to make my own life."

572
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:36,822
"One Life."

573
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:39,530
"Hundreds of dreams"

574
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:42,947
"I shall make them all come true."

575
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,572
"I got one life."

576
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:48,072
"And hundreds of dreams."

577
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:52,405
"I shall make them all come true."

578
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:57,738
"Yes, I'll make them all come true."

579
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:21,030
- Taru scored 85 percent.
- Congratulations, brother.

580
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:23,863
85! She got 85.

581
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:27,405
Taru got 85 percent.

582
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:28,655
That's a miracle!

583
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:33,738
You did it. 85 percent!

584
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:38,947
Nobody in the entire Ghasiteram
family ever scored that high.

585
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:40,780
And nobody ever will.

586
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:42,655
Why are you looking sad?

587
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:46,738
I came 4th.

588
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,697
You scored 85 percent.

589
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,697
I lost the challenge, papa.

590
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:56,447
It's your principal ma'am.

591
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,405
Principal.

592
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:03,697
Hello?

593
00:34:03,863 --> 00:34:05,572
Mr. Champak, congratulations!

594
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:08,697
Please give Tarika the good
news that she is going to London.

595
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:11,238
- London?
- No, but madam...

596
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:12,822
Mr. Bansal, try and understand,

597
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:15,947
Anmol Shekhawat who
ranked 1st isn't going.

598
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,863
Why ma'am?

599
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:19,780
Oh, Tarika... Congratulations!

600
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:22,738
Anmol always wanted
to go to IIT, right?

601
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,405
Yes, sorry. Thank you, ma'am!

602
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:30,697
Am I going for sure, ma'am?

603
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,530
Yes, definitely.

604
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:33,905
And Mr. Champak...

605
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,697
Yes?

606
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,863
You have to come for the annual day
and give a speech as well.

607
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:44,697
Are you pulling my leg...
Hello?

608
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:46,697
She hung up.

609
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,405
Papa... I'm going to London?

610
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:58,113
We'll have to go shop...

611
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:01,738
- I am going to London.
- My child...

612
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,447
You're going to London.

613
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:10,905
My daughter's going to London!

614
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,113
You're looking handsome.

615
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:13,616
Yeah, right.

616
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:14,905
Perfect!

617
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,363
I know that.

618
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:18,488
- Dear principal madam...
- Hi Tarika.

619
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:21,738
- Hi uncle.
- You...come here.

620
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:28,447
Above all...and honourable...

621
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,072
Mr. Bansal!

622
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,780
Come on, quick. Hurry up!

623
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:52,697
Give that to me.

624
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:00,363
Is that...

625
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:02,697
Papa, let's go.

626
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,238
Go on. I'll join you in a bit.
Go ahead.

627
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:08,405
I'll join you in a bit. Go ahead.

628
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,988
Come soon.

629
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:13,863
Hey Gajju.

630
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:20,072
The other night when you,
me and Gopi were drinking...

631
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,697
Remember what we were talking about.

632
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:30,613
Dear students,

633
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:37,655
there's nothing more precious
than the seeds of honesty...

634
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:45,280
...and ethics sown by this esteemed
institute of knowledge, 'Vidya Sadan'.

635
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:47,905
Could you move your leg a bit?

636
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,947
Bathroom...

637
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:55,030
Move your legs, please...

638
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:58,447
One moment please.

639
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:04,530
This is the very school
where honesty and hard work...

640
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:09,113
...became the fundamental
values of my life.

641
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:21,655
I'd just like to say that regardless
of what you become in life,

642
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,863
the most valuable thing
to treasure is honesty.

643
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,655
Papa, clap.

644
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:38,947
Thank you.

645
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:51,574
Now it's time to
felicitate our 3 students...

646
00:37:51,655 --> 00:37:53,697
...who have got the
opportunity of admission...

647
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:56,655
...in the esteemed Truford
University in London.

648
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:59,863
We shall begin with Tarika Bansal...

649
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:08,655
...and I would request her
father Mr. Bansal to say a few words.

650
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:25,072
You may take your seat.

651
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,863
Take one. Take one of ours.

652
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,488
Okay. Okay.

653
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:32,280
Mr. Champak, your speech?

654
00:38:32,488 --> 00:38:33,616
No, no.

655
00:38:33,697 --> 00:38:36,405
No, no, everyone's waiting for it,
you'll have to say something.

656
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:37,988
The stage is all yours.

657
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:39,655
You go.

658
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:49,697
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

659
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:57,655
Good morning dear principal madam,
dear students, dear...dear...on top of...

660
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:06,947
Above all most honorable
and honest Judge Chheda.

661
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,363
Inside I'm very...

662
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:20,072
I'm very emotional
and outside I'm very happy

663
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:22,697
for my daughter Taru.

664
00:39:29,988 --> 00:39:30,863
I...

665
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:32,655
Yeah?

666
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:35,988
The box of sweets has
to be delivered at the office.

667
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:38,905
Yes, I'll be there!

668
00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:46,613
That's all the English I know.

669
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:53,322
One moment, madam.

670
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:56,655
One moment.

671
00:39:58,655 --> 00:40:01,030
The honourable Judge
spoke about honesty.

672
00:40:01,738 --> 00:40:04,655
I'd like to add something to that.

673
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,947
There are three kinds
of people in this world.

674
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,738
Those who always score
90 to 100 percent marks,

675
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:12,947
and God only knows how.

676
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:16,655
There are some who push
their limits from 55 to 85 percent

677
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:19,488
with hard work and honesty,

678
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:22,530
like my daughter, Taru.

679
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:30,905
And the rest who make
it to the top through cheating,

680
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:34,488
like our Honorable Judge Chheda!

681
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:44,572
And if I say that I've
never seen anyone so corrupt,

682
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:45,988
it wouldn't be an exaggeration.

683
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:49,655
His Rolex watch is proof of this.

684
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,616
I know this because my
own cousin gave him the watch...

685
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:56,363
...to get the court's
ruling in his favor.

686
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:59,280
And my cousin doesn't
lie when he's drunk.

687
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:00,572
That's the truth.

688
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:03,238
Look at this. I have proof.

689
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:12,574
You tell me.
How does a district judge afford a

690
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:14,447
car like BMW
unless he takes bribes?

691
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,697
Papa.

692
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:17,572
Papa!

693
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:18,574
What?

694
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:20,905
Judge Chheda is the
Principal's husband.

695
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:22,488
What? No.

696
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:35,655
We have Mr. Gopi with us.

697
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:38,655
Could you shed some
light on this matter?

698
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:40,322
The honorable judge is
an honest man.

699
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:40,738
Yes.

700
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:43,072
This video that's gone viral is fake.

701
00:41:43,238 --> 00:41:48,447
That's not me in the video.
It's my lookalike who's been drugged.

702
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:50,280
He is talking nonsense.

703
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:53,280
Justice has prevailed and
these rich folk can't accept it.

704
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:56,988
I don't have the money to get a shave,
let alone afford a Rolex.

705
00:41:57,072 --> 00:42:00,030
The allegations against
Justice Chheda are grim.

706
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:05,072
Storming out of the school function
alone proves that...

707
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:21,655
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

708
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,572
Why would I, Taru?

709
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:49,697
Ninety-One... Ninety-One...

710
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:51,322
Excuse me?

711
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:08,863
What is it?

712
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:13,447
I just wanted to have
a word with you, madam.

713
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,738
How dare you come here?

714
00:43:19,405 --> 00:43:24,072
Madam, please come down or if you
grant me the permission, I'll come in.

715
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,488
Why do you need to come in?

716
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:30,280
You like putting on a show.
What are you ashamed of?

717
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:33,238
Go ahead.

718
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,530
Speak from there.

719
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:41,655
I made a mistake.

720
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:44,655
If I had known that the
Honorable Judge is your husband,

721
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:47,613
I would not have dreamed
of doing such a thing.

722
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:51,405
Teachers are godlike.
You know that better than anyone.

723
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:54,447
And even God forgives our sins.

724
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:56,655
I beg you to forgive me.

725
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,655
I'm no God. You can leave.

726
00:43:59,947 --> 00:44:03,988
No please, I'll do anything.

727
00:44:06,655 --> 00:44:08,655
Shame me publicly, if you like.

728
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,988
But please don't punish
my daughter, please.

729
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:17,030
Stop this circus and get lost!

730
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:21,574
I beg of you madam,
please let my daughter go to London.

731
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:23,905
She's worked very hard for this.

732
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:25,655
If she loses this opportunity...

733
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:28,988
...I'll never be
able to forgive myself.

734
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:34,072
You want me to handover
Tarika's approval letter, right?

735
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:35,405
Yes. Yes.

736
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:37,822
Fine.

737
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,613
Here.

738
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:28,947
What you've done is not right, madam.

739
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:33,655
You've said your part.

740
00:45:34,322 --> 00:45:35,655
Now hear me out.

741
00:45:37,072 --> 00:45:39,574
The truth is that your husband
was corrupt, is corrupt...

742
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,113
...and will always remain corrupt.

743
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:48,113
As for my daughter, she will
go to Truford University anyhow.

744
00:45:49,655 --> 00:45:52,488
Or I am not worthy
of the Ghasiteram name.

745
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:54,655
Mark my words!

746
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:10,572
Taru, Open the door.
don't do this.

747
00:46:10,655 --> 00:46:12,030
Go away, papa.

748
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:14,322
Please open the door.

749
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:16,280
Please go. I'm coming.

750
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:20,572
Come on, open the door.

751
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:26,863
You never really wanted me to go, see
the world, make something of myself.

752
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:32,322
You'll marry me off in a year or two.

753
00:46:38,197 --> 00:46:40,030
I had almost made it, papa.

754
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:46,613
I thought you understood me...
my dreams.

755
00:46:53,572 --> 00:46:56,863
Had mum been alive, she would have.

756
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,655
Tarika, don't say that.

757
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:02,863
Please don't say that.

758
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:06,655
Don't ever say that.

759
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:23,655
I've made this mistake once
with your mother.

760
00:47:27,905 --> 00:47:29,697
She was very smart.

761
00:47:32,613 --> 00:47:34,655
She won gold medals in academics.

762
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,947
Her father married
her off to an illiterate like me.

763
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,905
She must have felt
suffocated in this house.

764
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:51,822
I crushed all her dreams, unknowingly.

765
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,113
When you kill a person's dream,
he has no purpose to live.

766
00:48:00,572 --> 00:48:03,447
- That's why at a young age, she probably...
- No, Papa.

767
00:48:04,655 --> 00:48:05,697
Don't.

768
00:48:08,988 --> 00:48:11,238
My child, you are my dream.

769
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:13,447
Just wait and watch.

770
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,280
I've ruined one life already.
I won't let it happen again.

771
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:23,113
Wipe your tears and get ready.

772
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:27,447
I've challenged your principal.

773
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,822
You have to make your father proud.

774
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:38,072
Don't... my nose is running.

775
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,572
Come here.

776
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:45,363
You're my brave soldier.

777
00:48:47,697 --> 00:48:48,655
Right.

778
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,395
If you're finding it
difficult to read, shall I?

779
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:01,020
I know a bit of English.
A-1... Service.

780
00:49:01,937 --> 00:49:03,270
Why'd you eat up the middle word?

781
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,437
So that you can be of some use,
Miss English Medium.

782
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:09,229
That's a lot of pens for
someone who can't read!

783
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:13,854
Is it looking over the top?

784
00:49:13,937 --> 00:49:14,937
Let's go.

785
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:16,312
One second.

786
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:17,770
This one.

787
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:22,354
Your S.A.T.
and I.E.L.T.S. scores are pretty good.

788
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:24,604
Thank you, ma'am.

789
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,895
You can apply for the
foreign students' category.

790
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,314
Can I?

791
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:33,981
See.

792
00:49:34,937 --> 00:49:35,937
Are you single?

793
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,937
Beg your pardon?

794
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:38,687
I mean, are you a single parent?

795
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:43,104
Single, double,
yeah, I guess I'm everything.

796
00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:47,187
Must be lonely?
I mean, it must be difficult for you.

797
00:49:51,437 --> 00:49:54,979
Tarika, can I please speak
to your father for a moment?

798
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:56,062
It's okay ma'am.

799
00:49:56,145 --> 00:49:58,520
- I'll understand, and I can explain...
- Thank you. Thank you.

800
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:01,520
I can understand some English.
Stop worrying.

801
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,062
Pay attention...

802
00:50:03,145 --> 00:50:03,479
Please...

803
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:04,145
Go, go...

804
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:04,729
Outside.

805
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:05,895
Yes ma'am.

806
00:50:07,353 --> 00:50:11,520
Mr. Champak, do you have any idea
about the fees for studying in London?

807
00:50:13,062 --> 00:50:16,770
Don't worry about that.
I'll even sell my blood if I have to.

808
00:50:16,851 --> 00:50:18,770
Wow....wow.

809
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:21,895
But the cost of blood is
only rupees 200 per bottle...

810
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,604
...and the tuition
fees at the college,

811
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:28,354
along with hostel charges,
medical insurance...

812
00:50:28,604 --> 00:50:32,187
...food, transport,
all together is a bit expensive.

813
00:50:32,645 --> 00:50:33,937
How much?

814
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:39,187
Considering the college you want
and including the cost of living...

815
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:42,062
...there for 3 years would approximately
come up to ten million rupees.

816
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Ten million?

817
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:44,645
Ten million.

818
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:46,395
Ten million?

819
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:48,104
Ten million. Yes.

820
00:50:56,645 --> 00:50:57,645
Think about it...

821
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:01,770
You'll manage?

822
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:03,979
I've got some land I can sell.

823
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:08,102
Don't worry about it, just do it!

824
00:51:08,354 --> 00:51:09,229
Just do it?

825
00:51:09,562 --> 00:51:10,312
Wow.

826
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:20,687
Papa!

827
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:21,520
Yes?

828
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,604
Papa!

829
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:23,520
Yes?

830
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,937
The Truford University email has come.

831
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:27,562
Papa...

832
00:51:27,645 --> 00:51:30,187
Hang on. Don't open it yet.
I'm coming there.

833
00:51:31,104 --> 00:51:33,229
Show me. That's great.

834
00:51:33,354 --> 00:51:36,187
Wait, don't open it yet.
Okay, now.

835
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:36,937
Wait. Wait. Where shall I?

836
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,604
- Hurry up.
- It won't break here, wait.

837
00:51:42,397 --> 00:51:43,479
Open it.

838
00:51:44,604 --> 00:51:45,937
Oh wait, it didn't break.

839
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,979
No need.

840
00:51:47,677 --> 00:51:48,354
What?

841
00:51:51,562 --> 00:51:53,104
Sorry, papa.

842
00:51:57,479 --> 00:51:59,354
My child...

843
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:04,812
All of the twelve seats...

844
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:10,395
...have gone to Chinese students.

845
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:12,645
Don't worry...

846
00:52:14,312 --> 00:52:17,107
The Chinese have been trying to
steal our right since the time of Nehru.

847
00:52:17,187 --> 00:52:17,895
Yeah.

848
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:18,520
Right.

849
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:19,645
Nehru?

850
00:52:19,854 --> 00:52:23,437
Apart from the Indian herbs,
everything these days is 'Made in China'.

851
00:52:23,645 --> 00:52:24,354
Exactly.

852
00:52:24,604 --> 00:52:25,187
That's how it is.

853
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:29,229
There are other
universities in London.

854
00:52:30,145 --> 00:52:31,895
Do you have to go
to this particular one?

855
00:52:33,562 --> 00:52:35,020
It's a matter of pride.

856
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:37,312
I've given my word.

857
00:52:38,562 --> 00:52:39,645
There must be another way?

858
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,149
No way. The foreign
students' quota is full.

859
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:44,479
Isn't there any other
quota we can apply in?

860
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:48,395
There are seats available
but that is specifically...

861
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:51,854
...for citizens of the United Kingdom,
British citizens.

862
00:52:52,104 --> 00:52:54,645
And you know how stringent
immigration laws have become?

863
00:52:54,812 --> 00:52:58,479
Hold on. I'm confused.
What are we supposed to do?

864
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:00,149
What...

865
00:53:00,229 --> 00:53:03,312
With the chaos surrounding Brexit,

866
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,979
even tourist visas are
difficult to come by these days.

867
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:08,104
How on Earth will you
manage to get a Citizenship?

868
00:53:08,354 --> 00:53:13,395
I haven't visited my brother
who lives in London for 2 years.

869
00:53:13,854 --> 00:53:17,312
If I can't get a tourist visa, how
will you manage to get a citizenship?

870
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:18,687
Right?

871
00:53:18,854 --> 00:53:28,895
"O forgotten memories,
don't haunt me..."

872
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:34,020
Say something.

873
00:53:36,312 --> 00:53:40,645
The only dream my daughter had since
she was a kid has been crushed by me.

874
00:53:41,187 --> 00:53:43,687
Gajju, she's a piece of my heart.

875
00:53:44,062 --> 00:53:46,187
At least you have
someone to care about.

876
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:49,187
My wife left me right
after our wedding night.

877
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,395
At least your wife is alive!

878
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,687
I didn't give my wife
a chance to live.

879
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:58,187
My gambling addiction
has ruined my life.

880
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:00,562
I lost the family name.

881
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:03,395
I'm not able to send
my daughter to London.

882
00:54:03,479 --> 00:54:05,812
My life is nothing
but a big fat failure.

883
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:07,687
It's not that bad, Champak.

884
00:54:08,187 --> 00:54:10,145
I have a sexually transmitted disease!

885
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:12,187
What?

886
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,062
STD!

887
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,229
What's going on?

888
00:54:22,937 --> 00:54:25,687
Just to win the competition,
you'll make up any crap?

889
00:54:26,312 --> 00:54:29,520
Why don't you just say that you're
dead and this is your ghost talking!

890
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:32,895
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- What a bastard!

891
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:35,937
- This is the limit!
- Champak's got bigger problems.

892
00:54:36,937 --> 00:54:38,687
I'm sorry. I lost.

893
00:54:40,437 --> 00:54:44,020
People think I'm no good.

894
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:47,354
They tell me, "You thought you could
take your daughter to London to study?

895
00:54:47,437 --> 00:54:48,645
Who do you think you are?

896
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:50,145
You're a nobody."

897
00:54:50,226 --> 00:54:51,562
Who says so?

898
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:54,020
Tell me who?

899
00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:59,645
If that loser,
Bablu can go to London, why can't you?

900
00:55:00,187 --> 00:55:01,187
Who's Bablu?

901
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:03,187
He's in London?

902
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,524
Bablu, our Bradman, Don Bradman...

903
00:55:08,604 --> 00:55:10,062
He played cricket that well?

904
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:13,062
No. The bat and the
ball belonged to him.

905
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:14,562
If he got out,
he would take them and go.

906
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,604
That's how he had a high run rate.

907
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:18,979
He's on our school's chat group.

908
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:21,479
He posts some porn once in a while.

909
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,479
The stuff you forward to me?

910
00:55:23,562 --> 00:55:26,395
Yeah... He could help us.

911
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:29,979
- Here, talk to him.
- Here.

912
00:55:30,062 --> 00:55:31,562
Talk to him.

913
00:55:36,062 --> 00:55:37,354
Oi Bablu!

914
00:55:38,104 --> 00:55:40,979
It's me, Champak Ghasiteram.

915
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:42,645
Champak... careful.

916
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:46,107
Talk...

917
00:55:46,187 --> 00:55:48,187
Speak to him.

918
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:49,687
Hey.

919
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:54,895
Bablu, this is Chunnu from Udaipur.

920
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:56,104
Remember me?

921
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:59,229
I had rubbed cow dung
on your face when we were kids.

922
00:56:01,187 --> 00:56:02,854
Hello? He hung up.

923
00:56:04,312 --> 00:56:06,812
Is that how you introduce yourself?
'Rubbed cow dung on your face?'

924
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:08,562
Obviously he'd hang up.

925
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:09,687
What did I say?

926
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:10,645
Try again.

927
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,020
What, cowdung?

928
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:13,645
Phone.

929
00:56:15,187 --> 00:56:16,187
Call him again.

930
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:17,187
You talk to him.

931
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:20,645
Hey! Yo yo Bablu!

932
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:26,770
Bablu?

933
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,604
It's me, Champak Ghasiteram.

934
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:31,149
That was Gopi, that bastard...

935
00:56:31,229 --> 00:56:34,479
on the phone earlier.
I needed a small favour.

936
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:37,645
Do you know anyone at
any university in London?

937
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:39,937
My daughter needs
to get enrolled there.

938
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,187
You're like a brother to
me so I thought if you could...?

939
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:48,479
What? You want to
come here and discuss it?

940
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:51,729
He's saying he'll
come here and discuss it.

941
00:56:51,812 --> 00:56:53,937
- Call him over then, go on.
- Come over.

942
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,104
Come over? See you then.

943
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,145
Business class?

944
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:01,687
Business class? Yeah, so?

945
00:57:01,979 --> 00:57:03,604
Your whole family business class.

946
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:07,104
Yeah, yeah, call him.

947
00:57:08,437 --> 00:57:10,274
- Business class?
- Call him.

948
00:57:10,354 --> 00:57:12,770
Come, come.

949
00:57:15,187 --> 00:57:16,979
He said it'll be done.

950
00:57:17,145 --> 00:57:18,562
- He said it'll be done.
- Done?

951
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:20,104
I told you.

952
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,562
Champak, London is done?

953
00:57:22,979 --> 00:57:24,520
Buddy...

954
00:57:26,229 --> 00:57:27,854
Congratulations, Champak.

955
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:29,062
It's done!

956
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:31,062
It'll get done!

957
00:57:31,145 --> 00:57:32,229
Champak?

958
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:35,229
Will you be able to
manage without me?

959
00:57:36,979 --> 00:57:38,187
Will you come along?

960
00:57:38,812 --> 00:57:40,979
Well, if you insist I will.

961
00:57:41,062 --> 00:57:44,187
My daughter's getting
admission in London university!

962
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:45,937
This one..

963
00:57:47,691 --> 00:57:50,104
Okay. Weather's hot outside.

964
00:57:53,104 --> 00:57:54,437
You're looking smart.

965
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,274
Just for you.

966
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:56,229
Champak?

967
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:57,729
- Gajju.
- Oh, sorry.

968
00:57:57,812 --> 00:57:58,895
- Bablu?
- Yeah, yeah.

969
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,187
Start the music!

970
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,354
Stop the music!

971
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:06,520
I'm Champak.

972
00:58:06,604 --> 00:58:08,645
Oh! You've grown tall, mate!

973
00:58:08,854 --> 00:58:11,645
That's my wife, mate. My daughter...

974
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,107
Namaste!

975
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:15,020
London Bridge is falling down.

976
00:58:15,104 --> 00:58:16,937
Listen carefully.

977
00:58:17,312 --> 00:58:18,645
Give it your all.

978
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,479
Cover the entire field.
Don't spare any corner.

979
00:58:21,854 --> 00:58:25,604
Play as if this is the
last match of your life.

980
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:29,895
Whatever may happen,
Bablu cannot be bowled out!

981
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:31,395
Do you copy?

982
00:58:32,145 --> 00:58:33,520
God bless us!

983
00:58:35,395 --> 00:58:36,687
To your places.

984
00:58:38,062 --> 00:58:39,145
Come on.

985
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:41,187
Bloody hot, eh?

986
00:58:51,187 --> 00:58:53,812
Out!!

987
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:55,604
Shut up! Shut up!

988
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:58,604
Gajju, you should tell
him when it's a trial ball.

989
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,604
Trial ball... it's a trial ball.

990
00:59:01,687 --> 00:59:04,187
- What do you think you're doing?
- Clean bowled him on the first ball Gopi!

991
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:05,645
Is that how you bowl?

992
00:59:06,187 --> 00:59:09,187
You're not the cricketer, Murlidharan.

993
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,562
I'll cut the number of
wickets from your bus fee.

994
00:59:11,645 --> 00:59:13,479
Go easy on him.

995
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:16,187
I'm not used to a spin.

996
00:59:16,562 --> 00:59:18,562
In London the ball tends to swing.

997
00:59:18,895 --> 00:59:20,145
- Is it?
- Yeah.

998
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,687
- That's a four!
- Clap, clap for papa.

999
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,979
Come on. Come on.

1000
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:30,187
You sure, you can get it done?

1001
00:59:31,562 --> 00:59:36,187
Look Champak, you only have
to invest 100 thousand pounds,

1002
00:59:36,395 --> 00:59:38,187
generate employment for 10 people...

1003
00:59:38,395 --> 00:59:40,145
... and they'll give
you citizenship anyway.

1004
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,520
Come over and we could
do business together.

1005
00:59:43,737 --> 00:59:44,187
Okay.

1006
00:59:44,312 --> 00:59:46,979
Invest half your money now
and the rest later.

1007
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:52,020
And, my fee will be 5% of the total.

1008
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:52,562
Fees?

1009
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:55,020
These guys never pay fees to anyone...

1010
00:59:58,604 --> 01:00:00,187
I'll be leaving then.

1011
01:00:01,312 --> 01:00:02,645
What are you talking about?

1012
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,149
Wait, you're not even out yet.

1013
01:00:05,229 --> 01:00:07,770
You really think these
guys can get me out?

1014
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:08,979
At least finish the game.

1015
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:12,812
Champak bro, times have changed now.

1016
01:00:13,229 --> 01:00:18,107
I've shown you all some great
innings...100, 200, 300 runs.

1017
01:00:18,187 --> 01:00:20,687
- Did I ever ask for any fee then?
- No, never.

1018
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:21,354
Never.

1019
01:00:21,437 --> 01:00:24,187
- C'mon, put it back.
- Things have changed now.

1020
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:28,187
I can't offer you my services
unless you pay me for it.

1021
01:00:31,687 --> 01:00:34,229
Okay then, take a commission.

1022
01:00:34,479 --> 01:00:36,062
Why 5, take 6 percent.

1023
01:00:36,354 --> 01:00:38,062
I mean it.

1024
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:41,479
Very good! Let's play on then.

1025
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:43,145
Set it up again.

1026
01:00:43,395 --> 01:00:44,729
No problem then.

1027
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:47,187
Gopi and you could
travel on business visas

1028
01:00:47,479 --> 01:00:50,104
and Tarika could get a tourist visa.

1029
01:00:50,187 --> 01:00:54,895
In no more than 2 months, you'll
become an Englishman just like me.

1030
01:00:55,812 --> 01:00:58,229
We don't want to be Englishmen,
we just want admission.

1031
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:03,476
One more thing, you guys don't
have any cases filed against you, right?

1032
01:01:04,145 --> 01:01:05,145
Case?

1033
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:08,854
I mean court case...litigation.

1034
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:18,062
Case...

1035
01:01:22,687 --> 01:01:23,770
Listen carefully.

1036
01:01:24,104 --> 01:01:25,437
This is an affidavit.

1037
01:01:25,854 --> 01:01:28,145
You all have to sign it.

1038
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:33,895
It says, we are dropping all
the cases filed against each other.

1039
01:01:34,729 --> 01:01:39,854
I give my permission to every one of you
in Rajasthan to use the Ghasiteram name.

1040
01:01:40,145 --> 01:01:41,229
Really?

1041
01:01:42,062 --> 01:01:45,312
But I haven't given my permission
to let Tarika study abroad yet.

1042
01:01:45,395 --> 01:01:47,770
Oh god, Grandpa...

1043
01:01:47,854 --> 01:01:48,981
Papa...

1044
01:01:49,062 --> 01:01:52,895
- Hold on, sit down...
- Papa, no...

1045
01:01:52,979 --> 01:01:55,604
We don't need your permission.

1046
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,149
We've wasted all
our life behind a veil...

1047
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:00,187
...But you cannot stop her.

1048
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:01,812
She will go see the world.

1049
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:05,187
Heard that?

1050
01:02:06,395 --> 01:02:07,479
Everyone got it?

1051
01:02:07,812 --> 01:02:09,895
No more discussion on this now.

1052
01:02:21,729 --> 01:02:23,520
All hail Ghasiteram!

1053
01:02:33,229 --> 01:02:36,062
Could you please place your
thumb and four fingers on the scanner?

1054
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,395
Look, we have to put our thumb there.

1055
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:41,229
Thank you very much,
and just look into the camera please.

1056
01:02:44,854 --> 01:02:46,149
There you are, thank you very much.

1057
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,395
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1058
01:02:48,354 --> 01:02:49,229
Let's go.

1059
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:50,604
- Go ahead.
- No, you go first.

1060
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,062
It's your turn.

1061
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:53,562
You go.

1062
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,187
My brother.

1063
01:02:56,437 --> 01:02:57,687
Passport please.

1064
01:02:57,854 --> 01:02:58,770
Thank you.

1065
01:02:59,479 --> 01:03:01,187
Can I have your thumb print please?

1066
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:02,645
Thank you.

1067
01:03:04,437 --> 01:03:06,229
Could you just look
into the camera please?

1068
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:07,854
Thanks.

1069
01:03:09,187 --> 01:03:10,895
How long will you be
staying in England sir?

1070
01:03:10,979 --> 01:03:11,854
What?

1071
01:03:12,062 --> 01:03:14,395
How long will you
be staying in England?

1072
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,520
Long... Very long.

1073
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,020
What's the purpose of your visit sir?

1074
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:24,187
- Business...business, both of us.
- Sir please, step behind the line.

1075
01:03:24,312 --> 01:03:26,770
- His English is bad...
- Behind the line sir!

1076
01:03:27,145 --> 01:03:28,437
My big brother...

1077
01:03:29,479 --> 01:03:30,770
Thank you very much.

1078
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,645
- Champak, your turn.
- Next!

1079
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:44,437
What's that dog doing?

1080
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,645
Hey, control your dog, brother.

1081
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:48,395
Sir, are these your bags?

1082
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,520
Sir, are these your bags?

1083
01:03:49,604 --> 01:03:50,562
Is this your dog?

1084
01:03:51,187 --> 01:03:54,354
Sir, sir, you cannot leave
your bags unattended here.

1085
01:03:54,437 --> 01:03:55,979
Get the dog off our bags.

1086
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:58,229
There're food items in there.
The dog might pee over it.

1087
01:03:58,354 --> 01:04:00,899
Listen to me sir, are these
your bags is what I'm asking you.

1088
01:04:00,979 --> 01:04:02,562
There's pickle in a glass jar.
If it breaks...

1089
01:04:02,645 --> 01:04:03,520
What? What do you mean?

1090
01:04:03,604 --> 01:04:06,354
A glass jar with pickle
inside...might burst!

1091
01:04:06,437 --> 01:04:09,937
Woah...Woah!
Sir, calm down, calm down.

1092
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,854
I'd like you both to come with me.

1093
01:04:12,937 --> 01:04:14,812
- My daughter.
- Sir, now!

1094
01:04:14,895 --> 01:04:15,937
Let her come, and we'll go together.

1095
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,187
You need to come with me sir.
With me, now.

1096
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:27,145
Papa?

1097
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:32,687
Uncle Gopi?

1098
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:41,312
Now where were we?

1099
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,020
We do big business with Bablu.

1100
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:48,104
Baba-who?

1101
01:04:48,187 --> 01:04:49,104
Bablu...

1102
01:04:49,229 --> 01:04:51,104
Bablu...

1103
01:04:51,229 --> 01:04:52,812
Bablu...

1104
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:56,937
And what kind of business is he in?

1105
01:04:57,187 --> 01:04:59,312
What did he tell us? He had mentioned
something about his business.

1106
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,437
Medicine.

1107
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:03,354
What do you call that in English?

1108
01:05:04,354 --> 01:05:06,104
- Ayurveda?
- In English?

1109
01:05:06,187 --> 01:05:07,479
He won't get it.

1110
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:08,854
Wait a minute.

1111
01:05:09,145 --> 01:05:09,895
What is medicine called in English?

1112
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:10,979
Stop, stop!

1113
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:16,395
Drugs!

1114
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:20,107
Drugs?

1115
01:05:20,187 --> 01:05:21,187
God promise!

1116
01:05:23,479 --> 01:05:25,979
His name is Balashankar Tripathi.

1117
01:05:26,187 --> 01:05:28,645
He's a big name in the business.

1118
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:31,187
We came here to become partners.

1119
01:05:32,479 --> 01:05:33,395
Yeah.

1120
01:05:34,895 --> 01:05:38,395
He's our childhood friend.

1121
01:05:42,312 --> 01:05:43,229
Guv?

1122
01:05:43,854 --> 01:05:45,687
You got to see this.

1123
01:05:50,229 --> 01:05:51,479
Gentlemen.

1124
01:05:52,062 --> 01:05:52,770
All okay?

1125
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:56,354
By your own admission,
your friend's a drug dealer,

1126
01:05:56,854 --> 01:05:57,854
and you're working with him.

1127
01:05:57,937 --> 01:05:59,479
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1128
01:06:01,979 --> 01:06:04,854
Sir, drugs are very important.

1129
01:06:05,854 --> 01:06:08,229
All people should get drugs.

1130
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,979
We'll help Bablu to get big drugs.

1131
01:06:12,145 --> 01:06:13,187
What's there to it?

1132
01:06:14,062 --> 01:06:15,854
It'll give jobs to your people.

1133
01:06:15,937 --> 01:06:17,107
We become big.

1134
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:18,645
Bablu becomes big.

1135
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:21,354
All families...rich, poor, all...

1136
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:23,187
We're going to search your bags.

1137
01:06:24,354 --> 01:06:25,770
Oh man!

1138
01:06:26,812 --> 01:06:28,645
Let him search. Let him.

1139
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,395
Careful, the pickle bottle will break.

1140
01:06:33,187 --> 01:06:35,520
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

1141
01:06:35,604 --> 01:06:37,979
- Sir please calm down.
- You don't need to pull out a gun.

1142
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:39,895
We're not some terrorists.

1143
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:41,107
This is not ketchup.

1144
01:06:41,187 --> 01:06:42,149
This is pickle.

1145
01:06:42,229 --> 01:06:44,020
We're not strapped with a bomb!

1146
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,149
Hands where I can see them!

1147
01:06:46,229 --> 01:06:47,687
That's it.

1148
01:06:47,812 --> 01:06:48,520
Sit down.

1149
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,354
This is not America! Put
this gun down. We've been so polite.

1150
01:06:54,479 --> 01:06:57,812
Gopi, they say, never finger the police.

1151
01:06:57,895 --> 01:07:01,770
I never thought that the
police would finger us so badly.

1152
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:04,187
Neither did I....Aah!

1153
01:07:05,979 --> 01:07:08,312
You are allowed one phone call each,

1154
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:10,812
then you're going back
to India on the first out.

1155
01:07:10,895 --> 01:07:13,895
- My daughter is outside
- No, stop.

1156
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:16,020
Don't mention her name.

1157
01:07:16,104 --> 01:07:18,229
These guys here are all crazy. Imagine
if the same thing happens to her.

1158
01:07:18,562 --> 01:07:20,895
One phone call each.

1159
01:07:21,354 --> 01:07:23,979
Make a call to Bablu.

1160
01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:32,770
Hello.

1161
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:35,645
Bablu! We've got stuck here.

1162
01:07:35,729 --> 01:07:36,770
Looks like we're in some kind of mess.

1163
01:07:36,854 --> 01:07:38,812
Listen to me!
Taru is at the airport.

1164
01:07:38,895 --> 01:07:40,145
Please take care of her.

1165
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,812
Stop talking and listen to me.

1166
01:07:44,395 --> 01:07:45,437
What's he saying?

1167
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,770
Are you out of your mind?

1168
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,479
He just kept blabbering.

1169
01:07:51,562 --> 01:07:52,687
He's just not listening.

1170
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:54,020
He didn't hear you?

1171
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:54,562
What did he say?

1172
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:56,187
He said done but...

1173
01:07:56,312 --> 01:07:58,187
- He said done, right?
- Yeah, he did.

1174
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:01,687
Do you want to make a call?

1175
01:08:04,854 --> 01:08:06,229
Gajju!

1176
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:08,645
You're going to be deported,

1177
01:08:08,812 --> 01:08:11,187
and your passports will
be blacklisted forever.

1178
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,187
You cannot set foot
in the United Kingdom, ever!

1179
01:08:14,395 --> 01:08:15,937
Do you get that?

1180
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:24,466
This number is not in service.

1181
01:08:56,562 --> 01:08:58,646
Tarika, how are you?

1182
01:08:58,854 --> 01:09:00,566
Your father had called.

1183
01:09:00,646 --> 01:09:02,646
He was missing some crucial documents,

1184
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:05,479
so he's on his way back to India.

1185
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:09,729
India? But I'm here...

1186
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,524
Wait there.
Bablu will come pick you up.

1187
01:09:12,604 --> 01:09:16,812
Bablu uncle isn't answering
his phone and I don't have any money.

1188
01:09:16,896 --> 01:09:18,271
Oh God!

1189
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:20,604
He's not answering my
phone either but don't worry.

1190
01:09:20,771 --> 01:09:22,187
Don't lose heart.

1191
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:24,812
Champak told me to...

1192
01:09:24,896 --> 01:09:27,396
...deposit money in your HSBC account.
You can go to any branch.

1193
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,604
Book a good hotel room
with an attached toilet and bath.

1194
01:09:31,687 --> 01:09:34,354
And don't worry at all.

1195
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:35,604
Yes, uncle.

1196
01:09:36,896 --> 01:09:41,354
So what if those people
speak in English, we are no less.

1197
01:09:43,604 --> 01:09:44,646
Yes uncle.

1198
01:10:17,271 --> 01:10:18,566
- Hello.
- Hey, its Advait.

1199
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:20,479
I got your message on the University page.

1200
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:22,604
- Is this Tarika.
- Yes, I am Tarika.

1201
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:37,524
You. Get in the car.

1202
01:10:37,604 --> 01:10:38,646
Who are you?

1203
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:40,729
- Give me your bag. C'mon.
- Leave my bag.

1204
01:10:40,812 --> 01:10:41,854
Leave my bag.

1205
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,524
Get in the car.

1206
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:45,062
Jesus, Tarika!

1207
01:10:45,396 --> 01:10:46,521
Damn...

1208
01:10:46,896 --> 01:10:48,604
It's just me, Advait.

1209
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:50,396
You called me.

1210
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:52,562
Gone mad?

1211
01:10:55,354 --> 01:10:56,187
Damn it!

1212
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:03,604
I'm sorry

1213
01:11:04,187 --> 01:11:05,604
I'm sorry

1214
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:08,729
Um...its...

1215
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:10,354
I am fine.

1216
01:11:10,937 --> 01:11:12,271
I'm sorry

1217
01:11:20,396 --> 01:11:21,437
I'm sorry

1218
01:11:21,604 --> 01:11:24,021
We thought we'd break
the ice with a prank.

1219
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:26,566
Guess, it went wrong.

1220
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:28,729
Also, I love Chinese.

1221
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:31,521
He's Korean.

1222
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,187
Where's the party at?

1223
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:03,479
- So I'm just going to leave your stuff here.
- Addy.

1224
01:12:04,604 --> 01:12:05,896
Get out of here!

1225
01:12:29,604 --> 01:12:30,604
Yes.

1226
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:33,271
Yes, come now. Everyone's here.

1227
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:34,604
Yeah.

1228
01:12:57,937 --> 01:12:59,229
Hungry?

1229
01:12:59,562 --> 01:13:00,687
I'm non-veg.

1230
01:13:00,771 --> 01:13:03,021
Okay. It's vegan.

1231
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:06,604
I love that.

1232
01:13:07,187 --> 01:13:08,062
Okay.

1233
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:47,812
Leave them in the sink,
the maid will do them in the morning.

1234
01:13:55,896 --> 01:13:59,187
Madam, there's no maid here,
we do the dishes ourselves.

1235
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:01,396
Sorry.

1236
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:07,604
Here you go.

1237
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:11,479
You'll be fine, yeah?

1238
01:14:11,562 --> 01:14:12,271
Yes.

1239
01:14:12,812 --> 01:14:14,396
- Sleep well.
- Thank you.

1240
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:16,604
- Goodnight.
- Night-night.

1241
01:14:18,271 --> 01:14:20,854
This number is not in service.

1242
01:14:25,854 --> 01:14:27,396
Hello, Uncle Gajju?

1243
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:29,312
I can't reach anyone's phone.

1244
01:14:29,687 --> 01:14:33,646
Tell Papa, I tried Uncle
Bablu's phone but he didn't answer.

1245
01:14:34,312 --> 01:14:36,312
I'm staying in a Student house.

1246
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:39,646
There's a boy named
Advait who brought me here.

1247
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:41,354
He lives here as well.

1248
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,021
There are other girls as well,
all foreigners.

1249
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:55,812
Gajju. I have to get
to London at any cost...

1250
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:58,354
- Yes. Yes.
- My daughter's stuck there!

1251
01:14:58,437 --> 01:15:01,271
Yes, Champak, calm down.
I've thought of something.

1252
01:15:01,354 --> 01:15:02,229
What?

1253
01:15:02,312 --> 01:15:03,646
I'm going to send
you two back to London.

1254
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:06,354
Take this. Take it.
Flight tickets for this evening!

1255
01:15:06,437 --> 01:15:09,229
- This evening?
- You're the best. You're the best.

1256
01:15:09,812 --> 01:15:10,854
Wow!

1257
01:15:11,396 --> 01:15:12,604
Wait, what's this?

1258
01:15:13,771 --> 01:15:16,354
It's a ticket to Dubai?

1259
01:15:16,437 --> 01:15:18,729
What do you expect after you've
shut the doors to London forever?

1260
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:21,604
But why would we go to Dubai
when my daughter's in London?

1261
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,937
My cousin Tony is in Dubai.

1262
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:26,479
After being blacklisted only
one man can get you back.

1263
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:27,604
And that's Tony.

1264
01:15:27,685 --> 01:15:29,479
Only he can find a way.

1265
01:15:29,729 --> 01:15:33,354
But please clear his payment right away.

1266
01:15:33,437 --> 01:15:36,062
You're the best...a true friend.

1267
01:15:36,437 --> 01:15:38,687
That's fine,
but Tony is not your friend.

1268
01:15:39,229 --> 01:15:40,312
Don't keep his dues pending!

1269
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,524
If you would speak to
Tom from admissions...

1270
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:43,896
...he will sort it out for you.

1271
01:15:47,729 --> 01:15:48,771
It's not bad, is it?

1272
01:15:56,604 --> 01:15:57,646
Here you go.

1273
01:15:59,396 --> 01:16:01,062
Also, got this for you.

1274
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:04,771
Wow... Thank you.

1275
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:06,271
You're very welcome.

1276
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:12,524
Once papa's business is
set up and we get a citizenship...

1277
01:16:12,604 --> 01:16:14,271
You'll be sorted then.

1278
01:16:15,854 --> 01:16:17,312
Hungry?

1279
01:16:19,312 --> 01:16:21,312
- Hi D'.
- Hi.

1280
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:26,062
Your dad is on TV again.

1281
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:33,187
Your dad's a politician?

1282
01:16:34,646 --> 01:16:35,524
Come.

1283
01:16:35,604 --> 01:16:37,437
Why don't you live with him?

1284
01:16:37,604 --> 01:16:39,566
My dad is a politician, not me.

1285
01:16:39,646 --> 01:16:41,437
I can't afford that lifestyle.

1286
01:16:42,062 --> 01:16:43,687
Do you guys not get along?

1287
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:45,687
No. We're like buddies...

1288
01:16:46,062 --> 01:16:49,646
...but it's not like in India.
It doesn't matter who your father is.

1289
01:16:50,187 --> 01:16:51,604
Once you're 18, you're on your own.

1290
01:16:51,771 --> 01:16:53,437
You make your own life.

1291
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:55,062
Nobody's going to
do your life for you.

1292
01:16:55,479 --> 01:16:56,937
Listen, why don't you take a seat.

1293
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,604
And I'll just be back, yeah.

1294
01:16:58,771 --> 01:16:59,604
Two minutes.

1295
01:17:05,812 --> 01:17:07,062
What will you have?

1296
01:17:09,396 --> 01:17:10,062
What?

1297
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:11,562
Part-time job.

1298
01:17:11,687 --> 01:17:13,312
I have to pay my college fee, right?

1299
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:16,271
Even that your father doesn't pay for?

1300
01:17:16,604 --> 01:17:17,604
Depends.

1301
01:17:18,354 --> 01:17:19,937
My father probably would...

1302
01:17:20,604 --> 01:17:22,687
...but why would I be a burden?

1303
01:17:23,562 --> 01:17:24,396
Wow.

1304
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:27,437
I've never thought of it that way.

1305
01:17:27,854 --> 01:17:29,187
What can I get you?

1306
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:34,729
A job?

1307
01:17:35,646 --> 01:17:36,812
And a room...

1308
01:17:37,396 --> 01:17:38,604
...on rent please.

1309
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:42,771
Good choice.

1310
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:53,604
You'll have to suck up to her, and maybe
you'll get both the job and the room.

1311
01:17:54,812 --> 01:17:56,562
Mrs. Kohli can be a bit difficult.

1312
01:17:58,771 --> 01:18:01,021
Actually, a bit too difficult.

1313
01:18:08,437 --> 01:18:11,187
Alright Mrs. Kohli? What's up?

1314
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:16,354
Arthritis, blood pressure, gout,
back pain and I'm a tad depressed today.

1315
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:18,062
What about you?

1316
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:26,566
Ma'am, you two look so good together.

1317
01:18:26,646 --> 01:18:28,187
So nice.

1318
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:31,521
He's dead.

1319
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:37,524
Gajju told us...

1320
01:18:37,604 --> 01:18:41,187
if there's anyone who can get
us out of this mess, it's you Tony sir.

1321
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:47,604
Yes.

1322
01:18:48,271 --> 01:18:49,396
Look there.

1323
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:52,604
If it's not messy, it's not for me.

1324
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,271
So what if you got blacklisted?

1325
01:18:55,854 --> 01:18:57,646
I'll get you guys back there.

1326
01:18:57,729 --> 01:18:59,521
How?

1327
01:18:59,812 --> 01:19:03,187
Nigerian, Japanese...

1328
01:19:14,604 --> 01:19:17,604
This one will suit you better.

1329
01:19:19,604 --> 01:19:24,479
Here are 2 Pakistani
passports with UK visas.

1330
01:19:24,562 --> 01:19:27,062
We just need to switch
the photographs.

1331
01:19:27,271 --> 01:19:28,896
Pakistani?

1332
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:33,604
No, we're Ghasiterams,
how can we be Pakistani?

1333
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:35,937
Please give us some other option.

1334
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:44,354
Water?

1335
01:19:44,437 --> 01:19:45,479
No, thanks.

1336
01:19:45,646 --> 01:19:47,604
- We've had some.
- Some tea?

1337
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:48,646
Tea will be nice.

1338
01:19:49,937 --> 01:19:52,062
Water, water...

1339
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:07,562
Sorry buddy.

1340
01:20:08,896 --> 01:20:11,354
Isn't there another way?

1341
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:13,396
The chances of being
shot here are too high.

1342
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:15,687
That happens sometimes.

1343
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:17,812
You're in a vessel.

1344
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:18,896
A vessel?

1345
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:20,729
A boat. Boat!

1346
01:20:21,812 --> 01:20:24,896
You're on a boat.
The coast-guard is also on a boat.

1347
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:28,604
Your boat will rock.
Their boat will also rock...

1348
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:31,771
so the chances of getting
shot are very slim.

1349
01:20:33,604 --> 01:20:35,646
Dude, even I have studied math.

1350
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:40,604
If their boat will rock,
and our boat will also rock...

1351
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:43,479
Their motion will
cancel out our motion.

1352
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:44,479
What?

1353
01:20:45,187 --> 01:20:46,479
The motion will get
cancelled out.

1354
01:20:46,562 --> 01:20:48,604
We'll get shot
right between the eyes!

1355
01:20:49,229 --> 01:20:52,687
Oh! Tony sir, this is not
a video game where one has 3 lives.

1356
01:20:52,771 --> 01:20:54,729
Please value the one we have.

1357
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:57,271
Any other option?

1358
01:21:02,062 --> 01:21:02,979
Air!

1359
01:21:03,396 --> 01:21:05,312
Air?

1360
01:21:06,312 --> 01:21:09,524
Gopi.. It's too cold..
I can't breath..

1361
01:21:09,604 --> 01:21:10,604
Do something.

1362
01:21:18,604 --> 01:21:19,687
No...

1363
01:21:20,604 --> 01:21:24,771
Any chance we could
try an option via land?

1364
01:21:26,937 --> 01:21:32,187
We're from Rajasthan.
We have the stamina of a camel.

1365
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,687
We can cross vast deserts with ease.

1366
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:40,937
Did they only teach
you math in school?

1367
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:42,812
Not geography?

1368
01:21:43,646 --> 01:21:49,937
England is an island,
surrounded by water.

1369
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:53,524
I can swim across this with Champak
on my back in one stroke.

1370
01:21:53,604 --> 01:21:54,896
Idiot!

1371
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:58,479
This is the English channel,

1372
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:01,646
not a TV channel.
You can't cross it in one stroke.

1373
01:22:01,729 --> 01:22:04,271
Okay no problem,
show us another way.

1374
01:22:04,437 --> 01:22:06,687
Yes, give us an
option.

1375
01:22:08,062 --> 01:22:09,062
Something better.

1376
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:15,729
Gentlemen,
this is not a shopping site,

1377
01:22:16,604 --> 01:22:19,896
where you can keep
swiping for options.

1378
01:22:20,396 --> 01:22:21,271
I gave you 3 options,

1379
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,312
explained two of them and the
third one is to take those passports.

1380
01:22:23,729 --> 01:22:26,187
If you want another option,
come back after 6 months.

1381
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:29,187
- Now get lost.
- No, we have to go now.

1382
01:22:29,271 --> 01:22:30,937
We don't have that long.

1383
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:41,437
Take it.

1384
01:22:42,646 --> 01:22:44,937
No problem. Pick it up.

1385
01:22:49,062 --> 01:22:51,437
Remember your names

1386
01:22:52,354 --> 01:22:53,854
Abdul Razzaq

1387
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:56,604
and Saqlain Mushtaq.

1388
01:22:58,604 --> 01:23:01,271
I knew the Pakistani
cricket team is in a bad shape...

1389
01:23:01,604 --> 01:23:03,396
...but I didn't expect it to be that bad.

1390
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:06,354
No, those are not the
cricketers' passports.

1391
01:23:06,604 --> 01:23:08,524
Only the names are the same.

1392
01:23:08,604 --> 01:23:10,229
The people aren't.

1393
01:23:10,771 --> 01:23:12,771
Yeah, they look different.

1394
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:14,687
How will we pull off being Pakistani?

1395
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:16,604
It's no trouble at all.

1396
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:19,062
Just remember.

1397
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:23,229
If anyone asks you,
all you have to say is, Inshallah...

1398
01:23:23,312 --> 01:23:24,604
Inshallah...

1399
01:23:24,771 --> 01:23:27,187
- Boys played well!
- Boys played well!

1400
01:23:29,896 --> 01:23:31,271
No laughter.

1401
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:33,271
Inshallah...

1402
01:23:33,771 --> 01:23:34,812
Inshallah

1403
01:23:34,896 --> 01:23:36,354
Boys played well!

1404
01:23:36,437 --> 01:23:37,524
Inshallah boys played well!

1405
01:23:37,604 --> 01:23:40,187
Yes. Happy journey, happy journey.

1406
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:41,812
Get well soon!

1407
01:23:52,354 --> 01:23:53,062
Hello.

1408
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:57,479
Tony sir, we're at the immigration,
what should we do now?

1409
01:23:57,729 --> 01:24:01,271
Go to counter number
6 and nowhere else.

1410
01:24:01,354 --> 01:24:03,604
My man is expecting you.

1411
01:24:03,812 --> 01:24:04,771
Okay.

1412
01:24:04,854 --> 01:24:06,479
And listen...

1413
01:24:08,396 --> 01:24:13,566
The passport only has your photos,
not your biometrics.

1414
01:24:13,646 --> 01:24:14,729
What does that mean?

1415
01:24:15,062 --> 01:24:16,896
If you get caught,

1416
01:24:17,271 --> 01:24:21,479
chop off your fingers
but don't give your fingerprints.

1417
01:24:21,604 --> 01:24:23,354
What are you getting us into?

1418
01:24:23,562 --> 01:24:25,521
Why should we chop off our fingers?

1419
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:27,729
How will we make
sweets without fingers?

1420
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:28,812
Idiot.

1421
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:32,604
There's a lot more you won't
be able to do without your fingers.

1422
01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:34,146
Hang up now, you idiot!

1423
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:38,687
The younger one is a big idiot.

1424
01:24:38,896 --> 01:24:39,937
Hello?

1425
01:24:40,562 --> 01:24:41,604
He hung up?

1426
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:43,729
Why should we chop off our fingers?

1427
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,396
Number 4 please.

1428
01:24:45,896 --> 01:24:47,687
Sir, please, number 4.

1429
01:24:49,437 --> 01:24:50,312
Number 4.

1430
01:24:50,396 --> 01:24:51,521
You okay?

1431
01:24:52,604 --> 01:24:54,396
Number 4 please.

1432
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:56,896
I'm not feeling well...

1433
01:24:59,687 --> 01:25:00,771
Number 6 please.

1434
01:25:00,854 --> 01:25:03,521
Sister, let me go... I'm unwell.

1435
01:25:25,062 --> 01:25:26,854
Hey, that was easy!

1436
01:25:27,312 --> 01:25:30,312
No more Hindi.
We should speak in Urdu now.

1437
01:25:30,396 --> 01:25:32,021
In every breath we should spew Urdu.

1438
01:25:32,187 --> 01:25:33,021
How?

1439
01:25:33,187 --> 01:25:35,604
Marhabha! (Marvellous)

1440
01:25:35,687 --> 01:25:37,187
Marhabha!

1441
01:25:44,604 --> 01:25:45,771
Where have you got me?

1442
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:49,062
You got us here.
How will we get a taxi on a rooftop?

1443
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:51,812
- There are cabs but...
- Tell me what you're hiding Jason?

1444
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:53,729
Stay out of my business, bitch.

1445
01:25:53,812 --> 01:25:55,604
How can you do this?

1446
01:25:56,562 --> 01:25:59,812
Is he crazy?
How dare he hit a woman?

1447
01:25:59,896 --> 01:26:02,104
- Don't interfere in their matter.
- Wait here.

1448
01:26:02,187 --> 01:26:03,687
- Where are you going?
- Wait here.

1449
01:26:04,604 --> 01:26:05,646
- Champak!
- Hey you...

1450
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:07,646
Don't try to be a hero.

1451
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,604
Hey! How dare you hit a woman?

1452
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:19,937
Now, I get it. Champak!

1453
01:26:20,021 --> 01:26:21,524
They're being filmed
by hidden cameras!

1454
01:26:21,604 --> 01:26:24,566
- What's going...?
- Madam, no kissing, hidden cameras!

1455
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,187
You're a cop?

1456
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:28,229
Yes, I'm a freakin' cop!

1457
01:26:28,646 --> 01:26:30,687
And don't you ever touch a girl again.

1458
01:26:31,146 --> 01:26:32,437
- Naina!
- Asshole

1459
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:34,396
You couldn't stop those buffoons?
What were you guys doing?

1460
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:35,854
I told you,
we don't have anything on him.

1461
01:26:35,937 --> 01:26:38,521
Naina, Naina leave him!

1462
01:26:41,187 --> 01:26:42,271
Three months.

1463
01:26:43,312 --> 01:26:44,896
I was undercover for 3 months.

1464
01:26:45,604 --> 01:26:49,187
Thanks to your heroism,
the whole operation is busted.

1465
01:26:56,312 --> 01:26:57,521
What are your names?

1466
01:27:01,896 --> 01:27:03,146
Saqlain Mushtaq.

1467
01:27:07,604 --> 01:27:09,146
I'm also an all rounder..

1468
01:27:10,062 --> 01:27:11,812
the one Jadeja had thrashed.

1469
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:14,396
Take a guess. C'mon!

1470
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,604
Jacques Kalis?

1471
01:27:16,687 --> 01:27:17,729
Carl Hooper?

1472
01:27:18,562 --> 01:27:19,437
Glen McGrath?

1473
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:22,771
How is Glen McGrath an all-rounder?
The one from our motherland...

1474
01:27:25,146 --> 01:27:26,521
Abdul Razzaq?

1475
01:27:26,937 --> 01:27:28,524
That's right!

1476
01:27:28,604 --> 01:27:30,271
Jadeja beat him badly.

1477
01:27:30,354 --> 01:27:34,062
You can't leave till
we verify your background.

1478
01:27:34,812 --> 01:27:36,646
On what grounds?

1479
01:27:37,562 --> 01:27:40,062
Is it because of the way we look?

1480
01:27:41,396 --> 01:27:43,479
No... Please...

1481
01:27:43,562 --> 01:27:46,062
How do you think we got here?

1482
01:27:46,187 --> 01:27:49,354
That we came here, got
blacklisted, then went to Dubai,

1483
01:27:49,437 --> 01:27:52,771
got fake passports with our
photos and came back here?

1484
01:27:52,854 --> 01:27:56,562
No, you idiot,
she's not saying that... you are!

1485
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,479
Ma'am, we're very decent people.

1486
01:27:58,562 --> 01:28:00,896
What happened to your hands?

1487
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:06,521
Arthritis!
This cold weather makes it worse.

1488
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:08,271
Naina, the Superintendent
is on the line.

1489
01:28:08,354 --> 01:28:09,312
It doesn't look good.

1490
01:28:09,812 --> 01:28:11,312
When did this happen?

1491
01:28:12,604 --> 01:28:13,566
Keep talking to me.

1492
01:28:13,646 --> 01:28:14,604
Take their details and let them go.

1493
01:28:14,687 --> 01:28:16,354
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Yes sir.

1494
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:17,729
Since when...?

1495
01:28:17,812 --> 01:28:19,521
- I'm sorry.
- Tony...fingerprints.

1496
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:22,021
Why are you making these sounds?

1497
01:28:22,146 --> 01:28:23,396
I'm practicing Urdu.

1498
01:28:24,146 --> 01:28:25,812
Don't start in Urdu here.

1499
01:28:26,187 --> 01:28:29,562
I'm getting really confused,
when to speak Urdu and when not to.

1500
01:28:39,937 --> 01:28:41,271
How are you sweetheart?

1501
01:28:41,604 --> 01:28:43,437
Now that you're here I'm fine.

1502
01:28:44,812 --> 01:28:45,729
Careful.

1503
01:28:57,229 --> 01:28:59,062
Why are you both looking different?

1504
01:28:59,437 --> 01:29:00,146
Are we?

1505
01:29:01,062 --> 01:29:01,854
- What?
- Why?

1506
01:29:02,854 --> 01:29:03,604
No we aren't.

1507
01:29:03,896 --> 01:29:06,187
Ah, yes... we removed our earrings.

1508
01:29:06,604 --> 01:29:10,062
An astrologer told us to remove all
our accessories to improve our luck.

1509
01:29:10,229 --> 01:29:11,524
Ohh...

1510
01:29:11,604 --> 01:29:14,271
Come, let me show you the house.

1511
01:29:15,937 --> 01:29:18,146
Papa, did you get in
touch with Uncle Bablu?

1512
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:21,396
Bablu? Oh, his number had changed.

1513
01:29:21,521 --> 01:29:23,229
But we got in touch
and it's all sorted now.

1514
01:29:23,312 --> 01:29:25,562
We had such a tough
time finding his new number.

1515
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:28,604
Here you go.

1516
01:29:30,854 --> 01:29:33,524
Champak! Look, a swimming pool!

1517
01:29:33,604 --> 01:29:37,521
Wow! You have a swimming
pool inside the house!

1518
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:40,437
Where do you sleep?

1519
01:29:40,646 --> 01:29:41,896
In the room there...

1520
01:29:42,229 --> 01:29:43,604
Come, I'll show you.

1521
01:29:44,896 --> 01:29:46,229
Lovely place.

1522
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:48,229
Let's see her room first.

1523
01:29:48,312 --> 01:29:49,812
Then we'll see ours.

1524
01:29:50,854 --> 01:29:53,146
There's a fireplace too? That's nice.

1525
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:56,604
And look at this.

1526
01:29:57,146 --> 01:29:59,146
How soft this bed is!

1527
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:01,854
Where should we put our luggage?

1528
01:30:02,146 --> 01:30:03,146
You can't stay here.

1529
01:30:03,229 --> 01:30:05,524
This is a student house,
you won't be allowed here.

1530
01:30:05,604 --> 01:30:07,229
Wait a second.

1531
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:09,646
You can check with
our landlady, Mrs. Kohli.

1532
01:30:09,896 --> 01:30:10,979
She has rooms in her outhouse.

1533
01:30:11,062 --> 01:30:13,562
There was one vacant room.
You can shift in there.

1534
01:30:14,146 --> 01:30:15,896
Okay, so let's all move in there?

1535
01:30:16,646 --> 01:30:19,062
No papa, you go there. I'm fine here.

1536
01:30:19,354 --> 01:30:23,271
Ohh, you want to be cool huh?

1537
01:30:23,354 --> 01:30:24,562
Oh, please.

1538
01:30:25,062 --> 01:30:26,937
Go quickly and book the
room before it's given away.

1539
01:30:27,062 --> 01:30:29,271
- How can I...
- Only you can do it!

1540
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:31,771
- How will I find Mrs. Kohli?
- She stays close by.

1541
01:30:31,854 --> 01:30:34,524
- Go get it done.
- Why do I always do the dirty work?

1542
01:30:34,604 --> 01:30:36,646
Take a left after you
step out of the house.

1543
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:38,354
Hmmm...

1544
01:30:39,771 --> 01:30:41,562
I don't need to look cool. I am cool.

1545
01:30:46,386 --> 01:30:47,303
Hello?

1546
01:30:47,553 --> 01:30:48,553
Come in.

1547
01:31:05,082 --> 01:31:06,040
Yes?

1548
01:31:07,082 --> 01:31:07,665
No!

1549
01:31:07,873 --> 01:31:08,665
What?

1550
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,582
Who's this girl?

1551
01:31:12,998 --> 01:31:14,373
Is she a tenant?

1552
01:31:14,832 --> 01:31:17,665
Who puts up photos
of their tenants?

1553
01:31:19,082 --> 01:31:19,665
Then?

1554
01:31:19,832 --> 01:31:21,040
That's my daughter.

1555
01:31:23,665 --> 01:31:26,623
Hello....Hello? Hello?

1556
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:29,498
Why are you shouting, I'm coming.

1557
01:31:29,582 --> 01:31:30,540
Who?

1558
01:31:35,123 --> 01:31:38,584
I can see the steam
but it's not hot.

1559
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:39,665
It is hot, papa.

1560
01:31:39,748 --> 01:31:41,665
Did you add ginger?

1561
01:31:41,748 --> 01:31:43,873
Champak, we can't stay here.

1562
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:45,584
Why? It's such a nice house.

1563
01:31:45,665 --> 01:31:48,623
Not at all. Nothing is
right according to Feng-shui.

1564
01:31:48,707 --> 01:31:51,207
Since when do you
believe in Feng-shui?

1565
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:52,584
Don't be so orthodox.

1566
01:31:52,665 --> 01:31:55,498
We're in London, be modern.

1567
01:31:56,957 --> 01:31:57,584
Look, a bird!

1568
01:31:57,665 --> 01:31:58,290
Where?

1569
01:31:58,373 --> 01:31:59,957
Come here.

1570
01:32:01,998 --> 01:32:06,457
The lady cop who wasn't letting
us go is Mrs. Kohli's daughter.

1571
01:32:06,623 --> 01:32:08,582
And this is her house!

1572
01:32:21,748 --> 01:32:22,832
What happened, Papa?

1573
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,584
The vibe
of this house is not right.

1574
01:32:26,665 --> 01:32:27,707
But you just said...

1575
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:31,998
These concepts were made
for our own good.

1576
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:35,540
The bed in the room is so soft,
it can damage your back.

1577
01:32:35,623 --> 01:32:37,748
And there's a swimming
pool right in front of the house.

1578
01:32:38,207 --> 01:32:40,457
This place is not safe.

1579
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,584
We better go. Go pack your things.

1580
01:32:42,665 --> 01:32:44,998
I can't just leave.
I've paid the rent.

1581
01:32:45,207 --> 01:32:46,665
Forget about the rent.

1582
01:32:46,915 --> 01:32:48,665
Don't worry about that.
It's my money after all.

1583
01:32:48,748 --> 01:32:52,998
No papa, it's my money.
I took up a part time job.

1584
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:55,498
What did you say?

1585
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:57,998
- What?
- Job?

1586
01:32:58,207 --> 01:32:58,873
A part time job.

1587
01:32:58,957 --> 01:32:59,873
Job?

1588
01:33:00,457 --> 01:33:01,582
You are working?

1589
01:33:01,665 --> 01:33:02,626
I thought you wanted to study here?

1590
01:33:02,707 --> 01:33:04,626
Papa, my admission will be in Fall.

1591
01:33:04,707 --> 01:33:06,665
Till then I'll pick
up my own expenses,

1592
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:10,414
And I'll also repay you
my college fees as and when I can.

1593
01:33:10,873 --> 01:33:11,665
What...

1594
01:33:11,748 --> 01:33:15,040
What did you say?
You will return me my money?

1595
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,082
You should be happy.
I'm being responsible.

1596
01:33:22,123 --> 01:33:24,748
Are you? Or are you
calling us irresponsible?

1597
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,290
I can't really figure.

1598
01:33:27,457 --> 01:33:29,584
Now is not the time to argue.
Go and pack your bags.

1599
01:33:29,665 --> 01:33:33,915
- Papa, I can't go.
- Haven't I made myself clear enough?

1600
01:33:33,998 --> 01:33:36,584
- Please speak softly, papa.
- Calm down, Champak.

1601
01:33:36,665 --> 01:33:37,665
Whoa, what's going on? You alright?

1602
01:33:37,748 --> 01:33:38,873
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Sure, you're alright?

1603
01:33:38,957 --> 01:33:39,623
Yeah.

1604
01:33:42,957 --> 01:33:43,790
Does she also have a job?

1605
01:33:43,873 --> 01:33:46,623
Let's go inside... Please let's go.

1606
01:33:47,415 --> 01:33:49,540
Papa, what's the problem
with me staying here?

1607
01:33:49,623 --> 01:33:52,665
I have a problem and I don't
need to explain everything to you.

1608
01:33:52,748 --> 01:33:53,873
Please speak softly.

1609
01:33:53,957 --> 01:33:55,957
You're not old enough to live like this.

1610
01:33:56,248 --> 01:33:58,626
Get into college first. Then we'll
find you a decent flat-mate...

1611
01:33:58,707 --> 01:34:00,790
...from a good family.

1612
01:34:00,873 --> 01:34:02,498
It's a roommate, papa, not a husband.

1613
01:34:02,582 --> 01:34:03,915
It's not like I'm getting married.

1614
01:34:03,998 --> 01:34:05,957
Don't teach your father.

1615
01:34:06,248 --> 01:34:07,457
I've seen more of the world than you.

1616
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,957
No, you haven't, but I want to...

1617
01:34:09,498 --> 01:34:14,415
I don't want to be like a
frog who's whole world is a well.

1618
01:34:15,665 --> 01:34:16,665
What did you say?

1619
01:34:20,748 --> 01:34:24,415
You mean we're like frogs in a well?

1620
01:34:29,665 --> 01:34:31,707
Papa, whether you
are in Udaipur or London,

1621
01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:33,582
your view of the world is the same.

1622
01:34:34,498 --> 01:34:37,290
This time I won't
sacrifice my freedom.

1623
01:34:37,665 --> 01:34:41,915
I'm living here on my own terms,
you can't tell me what to do.

1624
01:34:52,082 --> 01:34:53,665
Is this how you speak
with your father?

1625
01:34:55,498 --> 01:34:58,498
Just because you're in London,
you've forgotten all your manners?

1626
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:00,415
He's your father!

1627
01:35:00,957 --> 01:35:02,873
Even today,
he's the one folding your clothes,

1628
01:35:03,623 --> 01:35:05,584
making tea for you,
fixing your punctured bicycle.

1629
01:35:05,665 --> 01:35:08,540
I've never asked him to.
He does these things on his own.

1630
01:35:08,623 --> 01:35:10,748
And didn't I manage
when he wasn't around?

1631
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:14,540
I found this house
and a job for myself.

1632
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:17,707
He left me stranded at the airport.
He didn't even call!

1633
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:19,665
Do you even know what we've been through.

1634
01:35:19,748 --> 01:35:21,415
Shut up!

1635
01:35:23,415 --> 01:35:24,665
Now you listen to me.

1636
01:35:24,832 --> 01:35:26,584
You want your freedom, right?

1637
01:35:26,665 --> 01:35:29,665
It doesn't come for free.
You have to pay a price for it.

1638
01:35:30,582 --> 01:35:34,665
If you want to stay here,
you can't call me papa anymore.

1639
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:40,415
I'm nobody to you and you're
nobody to me. That's it.

1640
01:35:40,498 --> 01:35:43,498
- You're overreacting, Champak.
- Let her do what she wants.

1641
01:35:43,582 --> 01:35:46,082
Once she gets in the college,
we'll go back.

1642
01:35:46,957 --> 01:35:48,498
Let her stay here.

1643
01:35:49,665 --> 01:35:51,707
I don't understand...

1644
01:35:58,665 --> 01:35:59,665
Champak.

1645
01:36:02,457 --> 01:36:03,498
Hey.

1646
01:36:06,123 --> 01:36:10,332
What's happened to you? Huh?

1647
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:12,957
Aren't you stretching this too far?

1648
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,415
Don't you get it?

1649
01:36:16,248 --> 01:36:18,582
I'm completely confused, Gopi.

1650
01:36:20,415 --> 01:36:23,957
What if the policewoman
finds out that Taru's my daughter?

1651
01:36:24,207 --> 01:36:26,040
We'll deal with
whatever comes our way...

1652
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,707
...but what about Taru?
How will she deal with it?

1653
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:30,915
It's not even her fault.

1654
01:36:31,457 --> 01:36:32,915
She's always wanted only one thing,

1655
01:36:32,998 --> 01:36:35,582
"Papa, when will we go abroad,
when will we go abroad?".

1656
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:37,665
And now that she's here,
imagine if she gets blacklisted.

1657
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:39,290
What do I do, Gopi?

1658
01:36:45,707 --> 01:36:46,915
Poor thing, she's upset

1659
01:36:46,998 --> 01:36:48,957
- What?
- She's hurt, poor thing.

1660
01:36:53,665 --> 01:36:54,457
What do I do?

1661
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:58,665
Nevermind. Let's go.

1662
01:36:59,748 --> 01:37:00,665
Sorry.

1663
01:37:11,665 --> 01:37:12,707
This is for one week.

1664
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:21,415
Come on, let's go.

1665
01:37:21,498 --> 01:37:22,540
Everyone...let's do a shot.

1666
01:37:22,623 --> 01:37:23,915
One shot everyone, c'mon!

1667
01:37:23,998 --> 01:37:25,498
Tarika?

1668
01:37:39,415 --> 01:37:43,207
Not supposed to speak Urdu,
we can barely speak English,

1669
01:37:43,582 --> 01:37:47,040
no one speaks Hindi,
your daughter isn't listening,

1670
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:51,665
Bablu is missing,
the policewoman is after us....

1671
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,332
Welcome to London!

1672
01:38:12,165 --> 01:38:13,873
This is locked and sealed.

1673
01:38:15,207 --> 01:38:17,582
The moron's phone
and house are both shut.

1674
01:38:19,457 --> 01:38:20,582
Should we go to the police station?

1675
01:38:20,665 --> 01:38:20,873
Yes.

1676
01:38:20,957 --> 01:38:22,623
To file a missing person's report.

1677
01:38:22,707 --> 01:38:25,332
Are you out of your mind?
We're here on fake passports.

1678
01:38:25,415 --> 01:38:26,998
How can we go to a police station?

1679
01:38:27,873 --> 01:38:29,540
Oh, yes.

1680
01:38:29,915 --> 01:38:32,373
We can't even go
near a police station.

1681
01:38:41,998 --> 01:38:44,040
Hello. Good morning.

1682
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:48,665
Not this way.

1683
01:38:48,873 --> 01:38:50,582
- Just follow me.
- I'm nervous.

1684
01:38:50,665 --> 01:38:52,457
Look, a Sardarji!

1685
01:38:53,165 --> 01:38:55,665
- Sardarji, Indian Sardarji!
- Hello

1686
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,707
- Sardarji...
- He'll hear us when he comes out.

1687
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:59,873
Can I help you lads?

1688
01:39:02,498 --> 01:39:05,290
It's Marhaba!

1689
01:39:05,373 --> 01:39:07,915
I mean Mohtarma...

1690
01:39:08,665 --> 01:39:10,915
- Inshallah! Boys played well.
- Inshallah! Mashallah!

1691
01:39:10,998 --> 01:39:13,082
- Praise the Lord.
- I love the Lord.

1692
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:14,623
- Hello
- Hello

1693
01:39:15,373 --> 01:39:16,498
What's your friend's name?

1694
01:39:16,832 --> 01:39:20,290
Full name is Balashankar Tripathi.

1695
01:39:20,748 --> 01:39:22,290
Bablu bro.

1696
01:39:22,998 --> 01:39:25,290
He's a Hindu but has a great heart.

1697
01:39:25,373 --> 01:39:26,373
Yes, that's true.

1698
01:39:31,707 --> 01:39:32,915
How do you know him?

1699
01:39:32,998 --> 01:39:34,123
He's our friend.

1700
01:39:34,207 --> 01:39:36,582
We played together as kids.

1701
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:39,748
Don't mention that.

1702
01:39:40,707 --> 01:39:42,748
You say you all are decent people...

1703
01:39:43,415 --> 01:39:46,373
...but your friend, "Bablu bro"

1704
01:39:47,707 --> 01:39:48,748
...is in jail.

1705
01:39:52,915 --> 01:39:54,957
Oh god!

1706
01:39:59,457 --> 01:40:01,582
Couldn't we get him out on bail?

1707
01:40:01,665 --> 01:40:02,457
Sure.

1708
01:40:02,748 --> 01:40:04,707
3000 pounds in bond security.

1709
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:07,165
Ask your lawyer to
come and get it done.

1710
01:40:25,332 --> 01:40:26,207
Where are you running of to?

1711
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:29,332
- Gopi, mate!
- Champak, here he is.

1712
01:40:29,415 --> 01:40:30,626
Welcome to London mate!

1713
01:40:30,707 --> 01:40:33,165
- Where's our money?
- What are you doing mate?

1714
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:35,332
I have the money. It's at home. Relax!

1715
01:40:35,415 --> 01:40:37,040
- Let's go home then!
- Relax!

1716
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:50,667
Move it.

1717
01:40:50,748 --> 01:40:53,748
Bablu, buddy,
just give our money back.

1718
01:40:54,332 --> 01:40:56,665
Just get my money back...

1719
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:57,748
Where is it?

1720
01:40:57,832 --> 01:41:00,040
Stop acting dumb!

1721
01:41:00,123 --> 01:41:02,332
Give my brother's money back!
Go, get it!

1722
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,082
You can beat me as
much as you want

1723
01:41:05,873 --> 01:41:09,665
But I don't have the money.

1724
01:41:11,582 --> 01:41:14,665
Forget money, I have nothing.

1725
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:21,707
My wife runs the house
doing a part-time job.

1726
01:41:23,332 --> 01:41:24,626
We're in a bad shape.

1727
01:41:24,707 --> 01:41:25,626
Your wife!

1728
01:41:25,707 --> 01:41:26,457
Oh!

1729
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:27,498
Hi...

1730
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,207
Hello!

1731
01:41:30,332 --> 01:41:31,623
Hello.

1732
01:41:31,707 --> 01:41:34,207
Bablu got emotional seeing us.

1733
01:41:34,665 --> 01:41:35,873
Please, come in.

1734
01:41:37,665 --> 01:41:38,790
It's Champak.

1735
01:41:40,665 --> 01:41:43,665
I owed money to a local
gang and had no way out,

1736
01:41:44,873 --> 01:41:46,457
They would've killed me.

1737
01:41:48,415 --> 01:41:49,707
That's when I got your call...

1738
01:41:50,623 --> 01:41:52,040
...and you invited me to India.

1739
01:41:53,915 --> 01:41:56,957
I gave away all your
money and saved my life.

1740
01:42:00,748 --> 01:42:05,665
I didn't have any money left,
not even for my bail.

1741
01:42:07,998 --> 01:42:10,873
If this is the life you were living,
why didn't you return to India?

1742
01:42:14,332 --> 01:42:15,582
Champak...

1743
01:42:16,123 --> 01:42:18,748
...you can't even imagine
the humiliation if I go back.

1744
01:42:20,207 --> 01:42:22,915
I will be stamped as a failure.

1745
01:42:25,665 --> 01:42:27,873
It's not easy to go back.

1746
01:42:30,748 --> 01:42:34,707
Bablu, take this money.

1747
01:42:38,373 --> 01:42:42,332
No, not again...

1748
01:42:55,665 --> 01:42:56,665
Champak...

1749
01:42:57,207 --> 01:42:59,665
So this travel agent Soni...

1750
01:42:59,915 --> 01:43:00,626
He...

1751
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:01,957
Not Soni, Tony.

1752
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,332
Whatever...

1753
01:43:03,665 --> 01:43:04,748
He told you...

1754
01:43:05,165 --> 01:43:07,457
...to come here on Pakistani passports...

1755
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,915
...convert your religion,

1756
01:43:10,623 --> 01:43:11,790
change your name,

1757
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:14,832
and then adopt your daughter,

1758
01:43:15,332 --> 01:43:19,207
spend 100,000 pounds
to get citizenship.

1759
01:43:19,332 --> 01:43:22,040
And then get her enrolled
in the college?

1760
01:43:22,123 --> 01:43:22,748
That's what he's saying.

1761
01:43:22,832 --> 01:43:24,290
He fooled you, this Sony.

1762
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:25,957
Not Sony, it's Tony.

1763
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,873
Whatever his name is, he's fooled you.

1764
01:43:28,623 --> 01:43:29,582
How are you so sure?

1765
01:43:29,665 --> 01:43:31,998
I know because even I fooled you.

1766
01:43:34,373 --> 01:43:36,665
I mean, that was then, not anymore.

1767
01:43:36,998 --> 01:43:39,626
What will I tell Taru's
mother after I die and go up there?

1768
01:43:39,707 --> 01:43:41,832
How will I face her?
How do I get Taru into this college?

1769
01:43:42,498 --> 01:43:44,998
Champak bro,
that's my responsibility now.

1770
01:43:45,623 --> 01:43:47,290
Give me 10 days and
I'll sort something out.

1771
01:44:04,832 --> 01:44:05,582
What is it?

1772
01:44:05,665 --> 01:44:08,665
Spying on someone is a crime.

1773
01:44:09,123 --> 01:44:10,665
It's called invasion of privacy.

1774
01:44:11,582 --> 01:44:13,998
I'm looking around at London.
If you happen to be in London,

1775
01:44:14,082 --> 01:44:15,707
what can I do?

1776
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:19,332
Fine...Keep looking!

1777
01:44:28,748 --> 01:44:36,165
"Never thought you would
ever make me cry"

1778
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:43,790
"Never thought my most precious
thing would grow apart from me"

1779
01:44:43,873 --> 01:44:51,332
"I know I'm away but
I haven't left you"

1780
01:44:51,915 --> 01:44:58,707
"Yes, I am helpless
but I'm not that bad."

1781
01:44:59,207 --> 01:45:00,290
Mr. Champak?

1782
01:45:02,123 --> 01:45:03,873
Please don't litter the streets.

1783
01:45:03,957 --> 01:45:05,873
We keep them clean here in London.

1784
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:11,498
Let's go.

1785
01:45:11,582 --> 01:45:14,873
Look what she called me.
"Mr. Champak!"

1786
01:45:14,957 --> 01:45:16,165
Did she say "Oi Champak"?

1787
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:19,123
No, "Mr. Champak".

1788
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:21,165
Mr. means she's addressing
you with respect.

1789
01:45:21,665 --> 01:45:23,332
We use it while filling forms.

1790
01:45:23,415 --> 01:45:25,290
Mr. Champak.

1791
01:45:25,498 --> 01:45:29,415
"No, you'd never get it"

1792
01:45:29,498 --> 01:45:33,332
"You will never really understand me."

1793
01:45:33,415 --> 01:45:37,165
"No, you'd never get it"

1794
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:41,248
"You will never really understand me."

1795
01:45:41,332 --> 01:45:45,540
"No, you'd never get it"

1796
01:45:45,623 --> 01:45:49,498
"You will never really understand me."

1797
01:46:54,873 --> 01:46:56,915
"Whatever I do..."

1798
01:46:56,998 --> 01:47:02,626
"...is never good enough for you."

1799
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:06,873
"Am I asking for too much?"

1800
01:47:06,957 --> 01:47:09,915
"You are all I have"

1801
01:47:09,998 --> 01:47:16,998
"It's only you for whom
I left everything behind"

1802
01:47:17,915 --> 01:47:25,415
"At least turn towards me.
Take a few steps my way."

1803
01:47:29,457 --> 01:47:33,457
"No, you'd never get it"

1804
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:37,457
"You will never really understand me."

1805
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:41,415
"No, you'd never get it"

1806
01:47:41,498 --> 01:47:45,790
"You will never really understand me."

1807
01:48:15,748 --> 01:48:17,582
If the mother and
daughter don't get along,

1808
01:48:17,665 --> 01:48:20,623
why is there such a big
photo of them in her house?

1809
01:48:20,707 --> 01:48:22,665
What exactly is your problem?

1810
01:48:23,207 --> 01:48:25,665
Is it the photo or is it the size
of the photo?

1811
01:48:25,873 --> 01:48:29,457
She said she doesn't get along with her
daughter. That's the end of the story!

1812
01:48:29,665 --> 01:48:31,707
- Something doesn't seem right.
- Everything's all right

1813
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:35,582
"No, you'd never get it"

1814
01:48:35,665 --> 01:48:39,665
"You will never really understand me."

1815
01:48:41,665 --> 01:48:43,415
- Champak bro.
- What is it?

1816
01:48:43,498 --> 01:48:45,207
There's one more chance
for Taru's admission!

1817
01:48:45,332 --> 01:48:47,582
- Really? How?
- A Fundraiser.

1818
01:48:47,665 --> 01:48:49,623
Fundraiser? What's that?

1819
01:48:49,998 --> 01:48:54,915
The university invites rich
people to give big donations.

1820
01:48:54,998 --> 01:48:57,540
The one who donates the
biggest amount gets a seat.

1821
01:48:57,623 --> 01:48:59,415
I'm figuring how to get the invitation.

1822
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:03,373
"No, you'd never get it"

1823
01:49:03,457 --> 01:49:07,207
"You will never really understand me."

1824
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:47,665
Excellent.

1825
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:49,790
My husband had a great stock.

1826
01:49:49,873 --> 01:49:50,665
Really?

1827
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,457
He didn't drink much but when he did,
he drank the best.

1828
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:55,582
It's the other way around for us.

1829
01:49:55,665 --> 01:49:57,707
Whether it's the best or not,
we always drink a lot.

1830
01:50:01,415 --> 01:50:02,707
With my hands...

1831
01:50:03,998 --> 01:50:06,540
I'll get it. You won't get up, I know.

1832
01:50:07,873 --> 01:50:09,540
Please come in.

1833
01:50:10,207 --> 01:50:11,790
Saqlain.

1834
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:18,040
- Please sit.
- Welcome

1835
01:50:18,957 --> 01:50:20,707
You've met before, Saqlain?

1836
01:50:20,998 --> 01:50:22,623
Yes, unfortunately.

1837
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:29,582
Can we talk in private, mom?

1838
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,665
Naina, please don't start now.

1839
01:50:32,415 --> 01:50:33,915
You're embarrassing my friends.

1840
01:50:34,207 --> 01:50:35,832
Do you even know these people...

1841
01:50:36,707 --> 01:50:38,540
...and the kind of people
they're friends with?

1842
01:50:38,748 --> 01:50:40,665
I am not answerable to you.

1843
01:50:41,707 --> 01:50:42,707
Abdul!

1844
01:50:42,957 --> 01:50:45,040
Like you have all
the freedom in your life,

1845
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:48,373
I too can bloody
well do whatever I want.

1846
01:50:48,998 --> 01:50:52,748
If they've committed a crime,
arrest them.

1847
01:50:54,832 --> 01:50:59,915
If not, then tell
me what you're here for?

1848
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:04,623
Tomorrow's your birthday, and I'm busy

1849
01:51:05,665 --> 01:51:07,665
so I thought I'd wish you today.

1850
01:51:08,498 --> 01:51:09,832
Oh I'm deeply obliged!

1851
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:15,207
Now that you're here,
get yourself a drink or go.

1852
01:51:16,707 --> 01:51:18,873
You're making my
friends uncomfortable.

1853
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:24,957
Are these guys more
important to you than me?

1854
01:51:26,415 --> 01:51:28,707
Am I important to you?

1855
01:51:30,665 --> 01:51:32,165
That's why I'm here mom!

1856
01:51:33,665 --> 01:51:34,998
On your own time, right?

1857
01:51:36,207 --> 01:51:37,873
It's always been about you.

1858
01:51:39,665 --> 01:51:44,707
Why a day before,
you could've wished me a month ago,

1859
01:51:45,332 --> 01:51:46,665
what difference would it make?

1860
01:51:47,457 --> 01:51:48,790
You know what?

1861
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:54,915
Keep it or trash it.
Do what you want.

1862
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,790
Happy birthday mom!

1863
01:52:12,665 --> 01:52:14,498
You have to light a candle,

1864
01:52:14,582 --> 01:52:19,040
clap your hands and you know
the happy birthday song, right?

1865
01:52:19,415 --> 01:52:22,165
Of course.
It's just one line.

1866
01:52:22,290 --> 01:52:24,748
"Happy-birthday-to-you"

1867
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:28,332
She had a bit too much last night.

1868
01:52:28,623 --> 01:52:30,665
She's too good.

1869
01:52:31,707 --> 01:52:34,582
I would've never imagined
meeting someone like her in London.

1870
01:52:39,207 --> 01:52:40,165
Hey!

1871
01:52:40,957 --> 01:52:42,748
She's lying on the floor.

1872
01:52:43,332 --> 01:52:44,582
- Look! She's on the floor.
- Where?

1873
01:52:44,665 --> 01:52:45,165
There.

1874
01:52:48,998 --> 01:52:50,415
Mrs. Kohli!

1875
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:54,915
- There's no other way in.
- Call someone!

1876
01:52:55,582 --> 01:52:56,915
Open the door!

1877
01:52:56,998 --> 01:52:59,457
- Madam Kohli!
- Break it open.

1878
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:00,582
How?

1879
01:53:00,665 --> 01:53:01,915
Kick it.

1880
01:53:02,290 --> 01:53:04,957
Are you shooing away a dog?
Break it down, kick it hard!

1881
01:53:05,415 --> 01:53:07,373
Not like that. Harder!

1882
01:53:07,457 --> 01:53:09,748
- Let me take a run up.
- Wait.

1883
01:53:09,957 --> 01:53:10,998
Okay, go!

1884
01:53:22,332 --> 01:53:23,290
Mrs. Kohli?

1885
01:53:23,373 --> 01:53:25,623
- Is she breathing?
- Kohli madam?

1886
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:32,498
They're so going to jail for this.

1887
01:53:39,373 --> 01:53:41,498
Stop, Stop!

1888
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,748
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1889
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:47,332
Woman die...

1890
01:53:47,415 --> 01:53:49,790
Please! I don't want to die...

1891
01:53:50,915 --> 01:53:52,457
...take the car!

1892
01:53:56,957 --> 01:54:00,707
We have sight of the described vehicle
heading north towards Paddington, over.

1893
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:03,373
Received. Maintain pursuit, over.

1894
01:54:09,998 --> 01:54:12,415
You're arrested for breaking
in and entering private premises.

1895
01:54:12,498 --> 01:54:13,415
Where's your partner?

1896
01:54:13,498 --> 01:54:15,540
Forget my partner!
Go check on your mum.

1897
01:54:15,623 --> 01:54:16,998
She was lying unconscious.

1898
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:18,998
We brought her to the hospital.

1899
01:54:22,748 --> 01:54:24,957
Naina, her BP had dropped severely.

1900
01:54:25,498 --> 01:54:27,665
How long had she been unconscious for?

1901
01:54:28,957 --> 01:54:30,040
I...

1902
01:54:31,498 --> 01:54:32,832
I'm not really sure.

1903
01:54:41,665 --> 01:54:44,332
But thankfully,
you brought her just in time.

1904
01:55:10,082 --> 01:55:10,998
I'm sorry.

1905
01:55:16,665 --> 01:55:21,332
When your mom wakes up,
you should say sorry to her.

1906
01:55:24,582 --> 01:55:27,623
The nurse was saying she's
had a heart attack before.

1907
01:55:29,498 --> 01:55:32,040
And you let her live alone?

1908
01:55:35,665 --> 01:55:37,915
I've been on my own since I was 18.

1909
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,790
I didn't want to be a burden on her.

1910
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:54,332
Independence at 18 is fine...

1911
01:55:54,707 --> 01:55:57,207
...but come back when
your parents need you.

1912
01:55:58,165 --> 01:56:01,373
What sort of a deal is this where
you use your parents till you're 18

1913
01:56:01,707 --> 01:56:05,665
and then you go away
in the name of freedom.

1914
01:56:14,998 --> 01:56:18,207
The only expectation parents
have is that their kids are...

1915
01:56:18,332 --> 01:56:22,207
...around to hold their
hand when they need them.

1916
01:56:24,415 --> 01:56:27,373
Give it a thought and you'll realize...

1917
01:56:27,957 --> 01:56:29,457
...how much she needs you.

1918
01:56:31,082 --> 01:56:32,498
Let's go.

1919
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:44,415
You still doubt us, don't you?

1920
01:56:50,165 --> 01:56:51,748
Well, you're right to do so.

1921
01:56:52,707 --> 01:56:54,540
But we aren't bad people.

1922
01:56:54,873 --> 01:56:59,290
We're in a difficult situation,
we're not here to stay.

1923
01:57:00,665 --> 01:57:02,790
I've come to leave that little hand...

1924
01:57:02,873 --> 01:57:04,665
...I held and taught to walk.

1925
01:57:15,748 --> 01:57:19,873
Happy Birthday to you.

1926
01:57:19,957 --> 01:57:23,790
From old friends and new.

1927
01:57:23,998 --> 01:57:27,373
From old friends and new.

1928
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:28,498
May good luck go...

1929
01:57:28,582 --> 01:57:30,332
You said the song had only one line.

1930
01:57:30,415 --> 01:57:32,123
They're making up their own lines.

1931
01:57:32,332 --> 01:57:34,832
- Thank you so much, darling.
- Great, see you tomorrow

1932
01:57:38,207 --> 01:57:41,498
Excuse me, could you check for Mr.
C. Lal on the list?

1933
01:57:41,582 --> 01:57:42,582
C. Lal.

1934
01:57:42,665 --> 01:57:43,582
Yes.

1935
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:45,915
You might find him somewhere here...

1936
01:57:45,998 --> 01:57:47,957
Oh I'm sorry, so sorry.

1937
01:57:52,373 --> 01:57:53,457
Where did he go?

1938
01:57:57,553 --> 01:58:00,719
And let him do the talking in English.

1939
01:58:05,386 --> 01:58:06,803
Do we look okay?

1940
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:08,928
You look like a gold mine.

1941
01:58:09,011 --> 01:58:10,178
And me?

1942
01:58:11,011 --> 01:58:13,178
You look like a beggar outside the
mine.

1943
01:58:13,261 --> 01:58:14,553
Rubbish!

1944
01:58:15,469 --> 01:58:17,094
What do you know what
a rich man looks like?

1945
01:58:17,219 --> 01:58:18,928
You're at Truford University,

1946
01:58:19,011 --> 01:58:21,428
England's most renowned university.
Please behave sophisticatedly.

1947
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:23,511
You're looking fantastic, trust me.

1948
01:58:23,594 --> 01:58:24,928
C'mon, lets go.

1949
01:58:27,219 --> 01:58:29,344
And now for the final
auction of the day,

1950
01:58:29,428 --> 01:58:33,261
the proceeds for which will go towards the
restoration of the Austen Library Block.

1951
01:58:33,678 --> 01:58:36,469
- This one's ours. This is the one.
- This one.

1952
01:58:36,553 --> 01:58:38,344
Yeah...

1953
01:58:38,678 --> 01:58:41,598
The starting bid is 90,000 pounds.

1954
01:58:41,678 --> 01:58:43,928
Oh, how very keen sir, thank you.

1955
01:58:44,011 --> 01:58:45,969
90,000 pounds from the gentleman
in the glamourous jacket.

1956
01:58:46,053 --> 01:58:48,928
Champak bro,
90,000 pounds means 9 million rupees

1957
01:58:49,011 --> 01:58:50,719
Please think twice
before lifting the paddle.

1958
01:58:50,803 --> 01:58:54,761
120,000 from the beautiful
lady in the leopard print.

1959
01:58:54,844 --> 01:58:58,428
Are we back in the
room with a 180? 180,000!

1960
01:58:58,511 --> 01:58:59,303
Thank you so much.

1961
01:58:59,386 --> 01:59:02,598
200,000 pounds! Thank you.
That's wonderfully generous...

1962
01:59:02,678 --> 01:59:06,011
What are you doing! 200,000
pounds means 20 million rupees!

1963
01:59:06,386 --> 01:59:07,511
How is it 20 million rupees!

1964
01:59:07,594 --> 01:59:09,511
I had said I'd do everything
but I'm not robbing a bank.

1965
01:59:09,594 --> 01:59:11,511
- What exchange rate did you check?
- I thought it's 200,000 rupees.

1966
01:59:11,594 --> 01:59:14,886
100 rupees per pound!
How much is that?

1967
01:59:15,178 --> 01:59:16,469
Champak, forget about it.
Let it go.

1968
01:59:16,553 --> 01:59:19,761
No, Bablu. Now that we're here,
we're not leaving empty handed.

1969
01:59:20,011 --> 01:59:25,678
Champak bro, don't lift the paddle
now or we'll get screwed.

1970
01:59:25,761 --> 01:59:28,678
- Let me figure something else out.
- You take.

1971
01:59:28,761 --> 01:59:29,844
Going once...

1972
01:59:30,094 --> 01:59:31,553
Going twice..

1973
01:59:33,386 --> 01:59:34,761
- 260,000
- Let it go.

1974
01:59:34,928 --> 01:59:36,928
Forget we're here.

1975
01:59:38,636 --> 01:59:41,803
300,000 pounds!

1976
01:59:42,469 --> 01:59:45,928
Going once, going twice...

1977
01:59:46,136 --> 01:59:46,636
Gone!

1978
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:50,844
A round of applause for
the gentleman in the gold jacket.

1979
01:59:59,886 --> 02:00:04,053
Congratulations sir, and thank you
so much for your extreme generosity.

1980
02:00:04,219 --> 02:00:04,761
What?

1981
02:00:05,553 --> 02:00:08,094
You have a week to transfer
the relevant funds.

1982
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,386
Until then please enjoy yourself.

1983
02:00:11,344 --> 02:00:12,344
Thank you.

1984
02:00:14,428 --> 02:00:16,511
What did he say?

1985
02:00:17,553 --> 02:00:18,678
Is he cancelling it?

1986
02:00:19,803 --> 02:00:22,678
He said we'll have to
give the money in a week's time

1987
02:00:23,178 --> 02:00:25,803
or else they'll give the seat away.

1988
02:00:27,636 --> 02:00:28,886
So we have to get the money!

1989
02:00:28,969 --> 02:00:30,678
From where will we get it?

1990
02:00:34,053 --> 02:00:37,636
Lucky number seven! Lucky number...

1991
02:00:38,594 --> 02:00:40,094
33, black

1992
02:00:43,553 --> 02:00:46,094
I can't believe it.
How could my lucky number betray me!

1993
02:00:46,219 --> 02:00:48,219
Just hold on.
One moment. Listen to me.

1994
02:00:48,303 --> 02:00:51,386
I'm getting a tip off.
Pakistan is going to lose.

1995
02:00:51,594 --> 02:00:52,011
Is it fixed?

1996
02:00:52,094 --> 02:00:53,928
Yeah. So shall we
put our money on India?

1997
02:00:54,011 --> 02:00:55,094
Yes, go ahead.

1998
02:00:55,219 --> 02:00:57,053
Mate, you put everything on India.

1999
02:00:58,053 --> 02:01:00,428
Pakistan! Pakistan!

2000
02:01:00,886 --> 02:01:04,344
The more expensive the car,
the more money we can ask for.

2001
02:01:04,553 --> 02:01:06,136
I'll come in front of a big car.

2002
02:01:06,219 --> 02:01:08,928
You negotiate accordingly.
I'll go now.

2003
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:10,428
Where are you going?

2004
02:01:10,969 --> 02:01:13,844
If you get hit by a car,
how will we negotiate in English?

2005
02:01:13,928 --> 02:01:16,511
It's not just about English.

2006
02:01:16,594 --> 02:01:19,094
To claim for insurance the person
has to be a resident of England.

2007
02:01:19,219 --> 02:01:21,344
So are we not human?

2008
02:01:21,678 --> 02:01:23,386
He's my brother, I will go.

2009
02:01:24,011 --> 02:01:25,428
Champak is more than a brother to me!

2010
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:27,303
- Champak!
- Champak bro!

2011
02:01:27,594 --> 02:01:31,261
Let go off me! Leave me.

2012
02:01:31,344 --> 02:01:33,011
Are you crazy? What were you thinking?

2013
02:01:33,094 --> 02:01:34,303
Let me go.

2014
02:01:34,469 --> 02:01:36,428
The cars are going at such a speed.
What if something were to happen to you!

2015
02:01:36,511 --> 02:01:38,636
Why were you going on your own?

2016
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:40,011
Whatever we do, we'll do together.

2017
02:01:40,094 --> 02:01:41,053
I need the money.

2018
02:01:41,178 --> 02:01:42,598
Why should you
put your lives at risk?

2019
02:01:42,678 --> 02:01:43,886
What for?

2020
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:20,011
I'll tell Taru tomorrow that
I couldn't get her admission done.

2021
02:02:20,594 --> 02:02:22,761
That's it. Let's go back.

2022
02:02:56,303 --> 02:02:58,678
Go back to sleep.

2023
02:02:59,969 --> 02:03:01,011
Champak

2024
02:03:02,303 --> 02:03:04,303
I thought a lot about it last night.

2025
02:03:06,011 --> 02:03:08,053
You, me and Gajju,

2026
02:03:09,969 --> 02:03:14,428
we've spent the best
time of our lives together.

2027
02:03:17,844 --> 02:03:22,386
You're not my own brother
but you're more than that.

2028
02:03:22,553 --> 02:03:25,178
Have you been drinking
early in the morning?

2029
02:03:27,678 --> 02:03:28,636
I'm not drunk.

2030
02:03:28,886 --> 02:03:30,594
I'm saying this from
the bottom of my heart.

2031
02:03:35,261 --> 02:03:40,011
We can't afford 30 million rupees

2032
02:03:43,053 --> 02:03:46,678
but our late great-grandfather
Ghasiteram could've.

2033
02:03:48,428 --> 02:03:50,011
Yes, so?

2034
02:03:50,428 --> 02:03:52,803
I was thinking,

2035
02:03:53,803 --> 02:03:58,261
if we sell Bheluram the
rights to the Ghasiteram name,

2036
02:03:59,178 --> 02:04:02,678
he would easily give
us 30 million rupees.

2037
02:04:03,011 --> 02:04:07,761
I knew you'd sell our family name,
you bastard!

2038
02:04:07,844 --> 02:04:11,386
- What? What's this?
- Hang on... Hang on...

2039
02:04:11,469 --> 02:04:13,594
- I've tied you up.
- Why have you tied me? Untie me!

2040
02:04:13,678 --> 02:04:15,344
- You'll beat me up.
- Gopi, untie me!

2041
02:04:15,428 --> 02:04:17,844
- I know you'll thrash me.
- I won't just thrash you.

2042
02:04:17,928 --> 02:04:19,803
I'll bury you alive.

2043
02:04:20,969 --> 02:04:22,553
- Listen to me.
- Untie me first.

2044
02:04:22,636 --> 02:04:24,678
You're forgetting one thing.
I have won the case.

2045
02:04:24,803 --> 02:04:25,928
I own the family title.

2046
02:04:26,011 --> 02:04:28,428
I can sell it to whoever I want.

2047
02:04:28,844 --> 02:04:31,428
You have no right over it.
Oi! Champak!

2048
02:04:32,178 --> 02:04:34,386
Listen to me carefully.

2049
02:04:34,678 --> 02:04:37,136
Our great-grandfather Ghasiteram must
be watching from above and weeping.

2050
02:04:37,469 --> 02:04:39,178
You can't educate your daughter...

2051
02:04:39,261 --> 02:04:41,386
You don't deserve to
call yourself a Ghasiteram.

2052
02:04:41,844 --> 02:04:45,678
If anyone in this world can beat you,
it has to be a Ghasiteram.

2053
02:04:46,011 --> 02:04:49,011
And no one else.

2054
02:04:49,844 --> 02:04:50,969
Do you understand that?

2055
02:04:52,053 --> 02:04:53,178
You're my brother.

2056
02:04:53,261 --> 02:04:54,678
I won't let you lose.

2057
02:04:56,636 --> 02:04:59,719
What's in a name?
We'll earn it again.

2058
02:05:02,553 --> 02:05:04,511
We have to get Taru the admission.

2059
02:05:09,761 --> 02:05:11,011
Shall I untie you now?

2060
02:05:12,886 --> 02:05:14,511
You are my brother.

2061
02:05:15,094 --> 02:05:16,469
Untie me, you idiot.

2062
02:05:18,219 --> 02:05:19,261
You're sure about it?

2063
02:05:20,469 --> 02:05:22,344
Grandpa is about
to put his thumb print.

2064
02:05:33,094 --> 02:05:34,386
Go ahead. Do it.

2065
02:05:36,886 --> 02:05:37,969
Do it.

2066
02:05:50,678 --> 02:05:53,011
Bheluram will wire the money.

2067
02:05:53,511 --> 02:05:56,219
From that can
I take what you owe me-

2068
02:05:59,094 --> 02:06:00,011
Brother...

2069
02:06:05,053 --> 02:06:06,053
Why didn't you...

2070
02:06:12,344 --> 02:06:13,594
It's gone now.

2071
02:06:15,386 --> 02:06:16,928
Idiot, this was your idea.

2072
02:06:24,761 --> 02:06:26,011
Hi Troy!

2073
02:06:26,553 --> 02:06:27,969
Where are we partying?

2074
02:06:28,678 --> 02:06:29,719
Partying!

2075
02:06:31,011 --> 02:06:32,219
Partying?

2076
02:06:33,136 --> 02:06:34,303
Taru. Come on.

2077
02:06:34,594 --> 02:06:35,511
Coming.

2078
02:06:40,428 --> 02:06:41,386
Whoa.

2079
02:06:44,636 --> 02:06:46,011
You look...

2080
02:06:47,053 --> 02:06:47,886
...hot!

2081
02:07:03,553 --> 02:07:04,261
Hey mate.

2082
02:07:05,678 --> 02:07:07,511
You should knock
before you enter!

2083
02:07:17,719 --> 02:07:20,344
Your admission was done so
I brought sweets to celebrate...

2084
02:07:22,928 --> 02:07:27,219
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.

2085
02:07:30,428 --> 02:07:31,428
What a weirdo.

2086
02:07:37,053 --> 02:07:40,469
Papa, can I talk
with you for a moment?

2087
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:43,261
You were going out somewhere.
You'll get late.

2088
02:07:43,344 --> 02:07:44,178
No, papa.

2089
02:07:44,636 --> 02:07:46,344
I'm sorry. You can come anytime.

2090
02:07:46,428 --> 02:07:47,844
I didn't mean that.

2091
02:07:47,928 --> 02:07:49,844
I don't mean to
interfere in your life.

2092
02:07:49,928 --> 02:07:52,719
It was important so
I thought I'd come and tell you.

2093
02:07:53,219 --> 02:07:56,261
You don't worry about me.
Your friends are waiting for you.

2094
02:07:57,011 --> 02:07:59,719
It doesn't matter, papa.
I want to talk with you.

2095
02:08:00,553 --> 02:08:03,636
It's such a big occasion.
Let's celebrate together.

2096
02:08:03,719 --> 02:08:06,261
Please wait,
let's have the sweets together.

2097
02:08:07,094 --> 02:08:10,011
That's not necessary.
I haven't really done anything great.

2098
02:08:10,344 --> 02:08:12,094
It's just a college admission.

2099
02:08:13,469 --> 02:08:14,386
And listen.

2100
02:08:14,886 --> 02:08:20,011
I don't have a problem who you hang
out or go out with.

2101
02:08:21,011 --> 02:08:22,386
It's your life.

2102
02:08:23,469 --> 02:08:25,011
Live the way you want.

2103
02:08:27,719 --> 02:08:33,011
You're smarter
than I thought, Taru.

2104
02:08:36,344 --> 02:08:40,636
Tomorrow your admission will
be finalized and then you'll be free,

2105
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:44,261
I'll be free,
we'll all be free, right?

2106
02:08:47,844 --> 02:08:51,928
Whenever you feel like coming home,
just barge in.

2107
02:08:52,678 --> 02:08:54,553
You don't need to knock.

2108
02:08:55,344 --> 02:08:57,386
The door will always be open for you.

2109
02:09:14,803 --> 02:09:19,094
"Hey little bird."

2110
02:09:19,178 --> 02:09:23,886
"Fly away tomorrow"

2111
02:09:32,303 --> 02:09:36,636
"Hey little bird."

2112
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:40,969
"Fly away tomorrow"

2113
02:09:41,053 --> 02:09:47,678
"But stay with me tonight."

2114
02:09:49,969 --> 02:09:51,511
Gopi...

2115
02:09:54,178 --> 02:09:56,303
...my little girl has grown up.

2116
02:10:03,386 --> 02:10:04,678
Fathers eventually understand.

2117
02:10:07,386 --> 02:10:11,556
"The path to your home."

2118
02:10:11,636 --> 02:10:15,598
"Awaits your return"

2119
02:10:15,678 --> 02:10:17,553
"We shall miss you."

2120
02:10:17,928 --> 02:10:21,344
"Don't make us wait too long..."

2121
02:10:24,178 --> 02:10:28,469
"My dearest one
You are always welcome"

2122
02:10:28,553 --> 02:10:33,094
"My darling daughter
You are always welcome."

2123
02:10:33,178 --> 02:10:41,969
"My dearest, oh my sweet, lil' girl"
"I'll never leave your hand."

2124
02:10:46,469 --> 02:10:48,178
Do these foreigners
also launder money?

2125
02:10:48,261 --> 02:10:50,511
Keep your mouth shut.
Let me do the talking.

2126
02:11:16,428 --> 02:11:18,598
Naina, you maybe
right about those guys.

2127
02:11:18,678 --> 02:11:22,011
We've just got a tip that they have
picked up 300 thousand pounds, cash.

2128
02:11:38,011 --> 02:11:40,553
Let's go.
We have to go to your college.

2129
02:11:44,303 --> 02:11:47,178
What?
Forget about it. Come, let's go.

2130
02:11:55,344 --> 02:11:56,678
We're tailing the suspect vehicle.

2131
02:11:56,761 --> 02:11:58,761
It seems to be heading
South of Brenton, over.

2132
02:12:03,178 --> 02:12:03,928
Hello?

2133
02:12:04,011 --> 02:12:06,094
This is Officer Naina Kohli.

2134
02:12:07,303 --> 02:12:11,761
You've reached the voicemail of Babs,
brother love Babs.

2135
02:12:11,844 --> 02:12:14,428
Leave a message after
the beep. Beep...

2136
02:12:14,511 --> 02:12:16,886
Stop this nonsense!
Give the phone to Abdul Razzaq.

2137
02:12:16,969 --> 02:12:20,511
Ma'am, there's no Abdul Razzaq here.
This is a wrong number.

2138
02:12:20,594 --> 02:12:22,178
This is the right number madam.

2139
02:12:22,261 --> 02:12:23,719
It's Abdul Razzaq speaking.
Good afternoon.

2140
02:12:23,803 --> 02:12:25,303
Who is this girl in the car?

2141
02:12:25,469 --> 02:12:29,136
Nobody. Yes, somebody.
This my daughter, Tarika.

2142
02:12:29,219 --> 02:12:30,094
Tarika?

2143
02:12:30,928 --> 02:12:32,636
How can your daughter be a Hindu?

2144
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:34,386
No, she can't but she is.
What can I do?

2145
02:12:34,469 --> 02:12:35,928
Papa, when did you become a Muslim?

2146
02:12:36,011 --> 02:12:36,678
No, no...

2147
02:12:36,761 --> 02:12:38,469
Why didn't you tell me
you have a daughter?

2148
02:12:38,553 --> 02:12:39,636
Who is she?

2149
02:12:40,094 --> 02:12:42,053
Are you having
an affair with her?

2150
02:12:42,386 --> 02:12:43,719
Are you two getting married?

2151
02:12:43,803 --> 02:12:46,261
Don't stop the car or you'll not only
lose 300,000 pounds but also...

2152
02:12:46,344 --> 02:12:47,928
...get deported to Pakistan.

2153
02:12:48,011 --> 02:12:50,303
Pakistan? 300 thousand pounds?

2154
02:12:50,386 --> 02:12:52,261
What's going on?

2155
02:12:52,344 --> 02:12:54,261
There's no weed in the car, right?

2156
02:12:54,344 --> 02:12:55,428
Weed?

2157
02:12:55,886 --> 02:12:58,553
Papa, I'm going to faint.

2158
02:12:58,636 --> 02:13:01,386
I should be the one fainting.
Keep quiet for a bit.

2159
02:13:01,469 --> 02:13:03,344
Bablu, head to Brenton scrapyard.

2160
02:13:03,428 --> 02:13:05,598
- That would be a detour.
- Just do what I'm saying!

2161
02:13:05,678 --> 02:13:09,011
If you get caught you won't get deported,
you'll be put in jail for life!

2162
02:13:10,219 --> 02:13:12,598
Take the inner circuit.
I think we're onto something big here.

2163
02:13:12,678 --> 02:13:14,469
Get me backup at Brenton scrapyard.

2164
02:13:22,969 --> 02:13:24,219
Mom, are you at the store?

2165
02:13:24,303 --> 02:13:26,011
Will someone tell me what's going on?

2166
02:13:26,094 --> 02:13:28,386
I don't know.
Only Champak can tell.

2167
02:13:28,469 --> 02:13:29,761
Where do I start?

2168
02:13:31,011 --> 02:13:33,803
Papa, when will we go?

2169
02:13:33,886 --> 02:13:35,469
We'll go, we'll go...

2170
02:13:35,553 --> 02:13:37,803
I have to show my face
to Taru's mother after I die.

2171
02:13:37,886 --> 02:13:39,844
What will I tell her?
I have to get her into the college.

2172
02:13:39,928 --> 02:13:41,553
My daughter is stuck there.

2173
02:13:41,886 --> 02:13:44,678
Don't worry. I can even
sell my blood to get the money.

2174
02:13:45,386 --> 02:13:47,553
You are my dream, my dear.

2175
02:13:51,011 --> 02:13:52,344
I need the money.

2176
02:13:52,428 --> 02:13:53,928
Where will we get the money from?

2177
02:13:54,011 --> 02:13:56,761
It's just a name.
We'll earn it again.

2178
02:13:59,719 --> 02:14:01,178
Papa, no...

2179
02:14:02,053 --> 02:14:04,011
Papa, Ghasiteram!

2180
02:14:06,011 --> 02:14:07,303
It's gone now.

2181
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:15,344
What would I do if something
were to happen to you?

2182
02:14:20,761 --> 02:14:24,261
And you did all of this for me?

2183
02:14:26,053 --> 02:14:29,636
Do you know, I was ashamed
to introduce you to my friends?

2184
02:14:39,428 --> 02:14:40,511
Sorry papa.

2185
02:14:44,928 --> 02:14:46,011
It's alright.

2186
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:47,844
Forget about it.

2187
02:14:48,303 --> 02:14:49,553
It's not alright!

2188
02:14:50,261 --> 02:14:53,386
You should be scolding me!

2189
02:14:54,386 --> 02:14:57,011
That never did anyone any good.

2190
02:14:59,719 --> 02:15:03,344
And what good have I done without it?

2191
02:15:05,094 --> 02:15:08,219
There are many colleges
in India where I can study.

2192
02:15:08,303 --> 02:15:12,053
If I want to study outside, I can move
to aunt's house in Jaipur.

2193
02:15:12,178 --> 02:15:13,261
It's already sold.

2194
02:15:13,761 --> 02:15:16,761
We might have to sell ours as well
to repay the debt.

2195
02:15:17,469 --> 02:15:19,094
Papa, don't worry about the money.

2196
02:15:19,219 --> 02:15:21,886
I'm with you.
We'll figure something out.

2197
02:15:22,344 --> 02:15:25,844
I'll help you.
I just don't want to study here.

2198
02:15:26,303 --> 02:15:27,511
London is alright.

2199
02:15:27,594 --> 02:15:31,511
London is good in its own way
but it's not for us.

2200
02:15:31,928 --> 02:15:34,469
You don't have to come to London
to be cool.

2201
02:15:34,553 --> 02:15:38,303
That's not how it is.
You have to be cool from within.

2202
02:15:40,678 --> 02:15:42,594
Papa, you are cool.

2203
02:15:44,011 --> 02:15:46,928
But what about your freedom?

2204
02:15:47,011 --> 02:15:50,636
What do I do with this freedom if
we aren't together to fight over it?

2205
02:15:51,469 --> 02:15:55,178
It's pointless coming home late if you
aren't there waiting at the door...

2206
02:15:55,636 --> 02:15:57,344
...to shout at me.

2207
02:16:00,678 --> 02:16:06,303
Papa, my life is all about you
and me together.

2208
02:16:09,678 --> 02:16:14,469
We're so close that
it gets irritating at times.

2209
02:16:14,553 --> 02:16:16,011
Yes, it does.

2210
02:16:16,594 --> 02:16:17,761
It does.

2211
02:16:20,011 --> 02:16:21,844
But that is our strength.

2212
02:16:24,761 --> 02:16:28,678
I have made my mind.
We are going back. That's it.

2213
02:16:29,386 --> 02:16:33,343
I'm sorry that you had to
go through so much because of me.

2214
02:16:33,677 --> 02:16:36,093
Please papa,
let's go back. I'm done here.

2215
02:16:36,218 --> 02:16:38,302
Tarika's absolutely right!

2216
02:16:39,343 --> 02:16:42,093
Even I'm leaving everything
and going back to India!

2217
02:16:42,927 --> 02:16:48,010
I won't live a dog's life here anymore.
I'll go there and do whatever I have to.

2218
02:17:09,635 --> 02:17:12,968
Something's not right,
let's get out of here.

2219
02:17:13,052 --> 02:17:16,010
- Something is definitely wrong.
- Is the cop car coming after us?

2220
02:17:18,427 --> 02:17:21,052
- Bablu, what have you done now?
- I've done nothing, shut up!

2221
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:25,093
We have a twin intercept approaching
from the north side, over.

2222
02:17:25,218 --> 02:17:26,885
- Copy, over.
- Oi what's in front of us?!

2223
02:17:27,718 --> 02:17:28,718
No...

2224
02:17:35,427 --> 02:17:36,843
We're safe, we're safe.

2225
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:38,302
What have you done?

2226
02:17:38,385 --> 02:17:41,260
- The Police is after us.
- I can see that. Shut up.

2227
02:17:41,885 --> 02:17:43,597
That policewoman is back!

2228
02:17:43,677 --> 02:17:45,343
Cut them off from the north side.

2229
02:17:51,593 --> 02:17:53,510
- Armed police!
- Get out of the car!

2230
02:17:53,593 --> 02:17:57,010
Get out of the car! Now!

2231
02:17:57,343 --> 02:17:59,093
Get out of the car!

2232
02:18:00,468 --> 02:18:01,302
Put your hands on the roof.

2233
02:18:01,385 --> 02:18:03,760
Where is the money?
Where the hell is the money?

2234
02:18:03,843 --> 02:18:05,093
We gave it...

2235
02:18:05,552 --> 02:18:08,343
- We gave it to your mom
- Sorry Bablu...

2236
02:18:09,427 --> 02:18:14,052
I'll have to hit you so that they
don't suspect that I'm on your side.

2237
02:18:14,177 --> 02:18:16,010
Give him 2 more slaps then.

2238
02:18:16,552 --> 02:18:17,968
Slap him hard.

2239
02:18:20,218 --> 02:18:22,677
Naina, there's nothing here.
They're clean.

2240
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:24,427
What do you mean
there's nothing here?

2241
02:18:24,510 --> 02:18:26,677
Calm down.
Okay? It was the informant, I'm sorry.

2242
02:18:27,052 --> 02:18:28,635
Okay gentlemen,
everybody needs to move back.

2243
02:18:28,718 --> 02:18:31,597
She can't touch me like this mate, this is
police brutality, 'Geneva Convention'.

2244
02:18:31,677 --> 02:18:33,052
Okay. There's been some
kind of misunderstanding.

2245
02:18:33,177 --> 02:18:35,218
- Can we all just forget this ever happened?
- I want compensation, man!

2246
02:18:35,302 --> 02:18:36,510
Yeah well,
we can deal with that at the station.

2247
02:18:36,593 --> 02:18:39,385
Listen, shut up and Whatsapp
him the rest.

2248
02:18:39,468 --> 02:18:40,302
Okay mate.

2249
02:18:58,802 --> 02:19:01,802
Think about it Taru,
this is your last chance.

2250
02:19:02,885 --> 02:19:05,260
We're Ghasiterams, uncle Bablu.

2251
02:19:05,843 --> 02:19:07,510
Our great-grandfather used to say,

2252
02:19:07,593 --> 02:19:08,760
"It's my business to sell sweets...

2253
02:19:08,843 --> 02:19:10,802
but my loyalty to
the country is not for sale."

2254
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:13,302
Now's the time to show our loyalty.

2255
02:19:17,802 --> 02:19:20,927
I will study there and make Ghasiteram
an international brand one day.

2256
02:19:22,927 --> 02:19:27,552
Champak, today our great-grandfather
would've been very proud.

2257
02:19:28,385 --> 02:19:32,468
Taru proved to be the real
Ghasiteram - first original!

2258
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:44,260
So this was the third time when
I had no confusion.

2259
02:19:48,635 --> 02:19:52,718
I came here to educate my daughter
but I'm the one leaving with a lesson.

2260
02:19:56,343 --> 02:19:59,260
When children are young,
we hold their hand

2261
02:19:59,427 --> 02:20:02,093
so that they don't
get lost in a crowd,

2262
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:06,010
and when they grow
up and leave our hand,

2263
02:20:06,843 --> 02:20:09,718
we end up feeling completely lost...

2264
02:20:11,427 --> 02:20:13,177
But the truth, my friends, is...

2265
02:20:14,010 --> 02:20:17,177
if you don't let
go of your child's hand,

2266
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:20,968
how will they return to embrace you.

2267
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:40,343
Hot oil trick!

2268
02:20:40,802 --> 02:20:42,468
Hot oil trick!

2269
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:52,302
Try, try... Don't feel shy.

2270
02:20:53,302 --> 02:20:55,427
As sweet as you. Eat.

2271
02:20:57,010 --> 02:20:59,427
Oh, Bablu!

2272
02:21:00,468 --> 02:21:01,555
Don't take that.

2273
02:21:01,635 --> 02:21:03,468
Your tummy will go for a toss.

2274
02:21:03,635 --> 02:21:04,510
No thanks.

2275
02:21:04,677 --> 02:21:05,677
"No thanks."

2276
02:21:07,302 --> 02:21:08,385
What's up Tarika?

2277
02:21:08,468 --> 02:21:10,843
Hello uncle Bablu!
How are you doing?

2278
02:21:11,302 --> 02:21:13,468
That's the song. Check it out!

2279
02:21:15,802 --> 02:21:20,635
What? No,
you should come to Udaipur once.

2280
02:21:20,718 --> 02:21:23,052
We'll treat you to
some real Indian sweets.

2281
02:21:23,427 --> 02:21:25,510
There's a lot to see here.

2282
02:21:26,635 --> 02:21:28,343
Bring Mrs. Kohli along.

2283
02:21:28,427 --> 02:21:29,968
It'll be a good change for her.

2284
02:21:30,635 --> 02:21:32,677
Okay. Bye.

2285
02:21:46,427 --> 02:21:49,385
How dare you guys put up the
Ghasiteram board?

2286
02:21:49,718 --> 02:21:51,093
I'm going to sue you.

2287
02:21:51,802 --> 02:21:53,218
You'll sue us?

2288
02:21:54,385 --> 02:21:55,843
You'll sue us?

2289
02:21:55,927 --> 02:21:57,760
We'll hammer you with 127 cases!

2290
02:21:57,843 --> 02:22:00,302
We hold the Guinness Book
of World Records at suing, you fool.

2291
02:22:01,302 --> 02:22:03,677
You are a fool, I have
the signed documents.

2292
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:05,093
I've paid the money for it.

2293
02:22:05,218 --> 02:22:08,760
So take it back, with interest.

2294
02:22:08,843 --> 02:22:10,552
I'm Ghasiteram now.

2295
02:22:10,635 --> 02:22:12,510
I won't let go of the title.

2296
02:22:12,593 --> 02:22:13,968
What did you call yourself?

2297
02:22:14,052 --> 02:22:16,843
Or else my name isn't Chandiram.

2298
02:22:17,968 --> 02:22:21,343
Gajju, get your luxury
bus service this time.

2299
02:22:21,427 --> 02:22:22,597
This case will go on for long.

2300
02:22:22,677 --> 02:22:24,093
And who'll pay my fees this time?

2301
02:22:24,218 --> 02:22:24,927
Shut up!

2302
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:30,093
Nobody will take the Ghasiteram
boards off from their shops.

2303
02:22:30,218 --> 02:22:32,177
- So say...No, you say it.
- No, you say it.

2304
02:22:32,302 --> 02:22:34,968
- No, no, you say it.
- No, no, you.

2305
02:22:35,385 --> 02:22:38,385
Okay... so all hail
Ghasiteram Todarmal Bansal!

2306
02:22:38,468 --> 02:22:39,218
All hail!

2307
02:22:39,302 --> 02:22:41,427
- All hail Ghasiteram!
- All hail!

2308
02:22:41,510 --> 02:22:43,427
- All hail Ghasiteram!
- All hail!

2309
02:23:16,802 --> 02:23:19,343
"Why does the beautiful girl..."

2310
02:23:19,427 --> 02:23:24,385
"...keep her face veiled?
Tell me why? Oh, tell me why"

2311
02:23:24,927 --> 02:23:30,343
"The girl is full of brilliance
if only the world let her be."

2312
02:23:30,885 --> 02:23:32,635
"So let her be...just let her be"

2313
02:23:33,385 --> 02:23:37,218
"She is so amazing,
she can do wonders..."

2314
02:23:37,302 --> 02:23:40,552
"Let her dance to her own beat."

2315
02:23:40,635 --> 02:23:42,677
"Let the girl dance..."

2316
02:23:43,052 --> 02:23:44,555
"Just let her dance..."

2317
02:23:44,635 --> 02:23:46,593
"Let her be free"

2318
02:23:47,385 --> 02:23:48,597
"Let her fly"

2319
02:23:48,677 --> 02:23:52,677
"Let the girl dance...
Just let her dance..."

2320
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:55,302
"Leaving all her troubles behind."

2321
02:23:55,552 --> 02:23:56,718
"Let the girl shine."

2322
02:23:56,802 --> 02:24:00,802
"Let the girl dance...
Just let her dance..."

2323
02:24:00,885 --> 02:24:03,555
"Let her be free"

2324
02:24:03,635 --> 02:24:04,927
"Let her fly"

2325
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:08,927
"Let the girl dance...
Just let her dance..."

2326
02:24:09,010 --> 02:24:11,635
"Leaving all her troubles behind."

2327
02:24:11,718 --> 02:24:16,211
"Let the girl shine."
"Let the girl dance..."

2328
02:24:32,072 --> 02:24:34,555
"All your big talk..."

2329
02:24:34,635 --> 02:24:40,177
"...don't judge her
with your small mind."

2330
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:42,597
"Why do you frown upon the girl?"

2331
02:24:42,677 --> 02:24:45,968
"Smile and the world
will smile with you."

2332
02:24:46,052 --> 02:24:48,052
"That's right..."

2333
02:24:48,177 --> 02:24:52,843
"Let the girl get on the floor
and dance to her own beat."

2334
02:24:52,927 --> 02:24:56,052
"Let the world dance to her beat."

2335
02:24:57,802 --> 02:25:00,052
"Let the girl dance..."

2336
02:25:00,135 --> 02:25:01,802
" Just let her dance..."

2337
02:25:01,885 --> 02:25:04,093
"Let her be free"

2338
02:25:04,635 --> 02:25:05,885
"Let her fly"

2339
02:25:05,968 --> 02:25:08,093
"Let the girl dance..."

2340
02:25:08,177 --> 02:25:09,927
" Just let her dance..."

2341
02:25:10,010 --> 02:25:12,597
"Leaving all her troubles behind."

2342
02:25:12,677 --> 02:25:14,093
"Let the girl shine"

2343
02:25:14,177 --> 02:25:16,593
"Let her dance"

2344
02:25:20,135 --> 02:25:22,052
"Let the girl dance..."
