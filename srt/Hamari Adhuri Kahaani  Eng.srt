1
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:06,042
Lying is a sin..

2
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,876
It's a grave sin.

3
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,001
I'm not lying.

4
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:15,667
Vasudha came to see me this morning..

5
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:21,917
It was around 4am.

6
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,792
She...

7
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,917
...was wearing a red sweater.

8
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:36,167
But..She looked very ill and tired.

9
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:40,667
I asked her to sit down and rest.

10
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,126
But she refused.

11
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:46,626
Then she asked me a question.

12
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,917
- Did she?

13
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:49,542
Yes.

14
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:56,126
She said "Where...
would Radha go after her death?"

15
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:59,542
I said that's an absurd question.

16
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:03,042
Radha would unite with
her Krishna after she's dead.

17
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,251
Where else would she go?

18
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,876
That's her final resting place.

19
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:17,042
She started smiling
after hearing my answer.

20
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:23,001
She came close to me and said...

21
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,126
..."Hari, always remember this."

22
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:31,126
"Don't forget this ever."

23
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:38,501
Then she just got up and
walked out into the sunlight.

24
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:39,876
Hari...

25
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,626
Vasudha left you 21 years ago...

26
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:49,001
...and you're still
mourning her leaving.

27
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,792
You don't understand
that you didn't see her.

28
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,001
It's just your imagination.

29
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,417
Hallucinations.

30
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:02,292
Every 2 - 2 1/2 years you
say the same thing.

31
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:05,626
All you have to do is take a break.

32
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,667
lam increasing your dosage.

33
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,751
Let's wait and see how they work.

34
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,126
Next patient please.

35
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,626
I don't need medication, doctor.

36
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,917
I am not sick.

37
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,126
lam not insane.

38
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:21,292
Vasudha did come this morning.

39
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,792
At around 4am...
- Hari.

40
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,792
Hari, just let her go.

41
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:26,917
Just let her go.

42
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,542
Just let her go.
- She was wearing a red sweater...

43
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,876
Otherwise it will get worse...

44
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:34,626
...and my worst fear will come true.

45
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,542
You'll have to be sent
to a mental asylum. Get it.

46
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,042
Red color..
- Fine.

47
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,042
Red..
- Come on.

48
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,917
Hari, she's here to see you.

49
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,042
I'm Avni.

50
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,792
Saanj's wife.

51
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:05,542
Has something happened?

52
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:10,626
Actually, Avni and I...

53
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,917
...had gone to Singapore...

54
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:16,542
...for my company's work.

55
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:20,042
- While we were leaving, mom called..

56
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,917
- ...and said she wanted to visit the
temple since it was Durga Pooja.

57
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:25,542
That was the last
time we heard from her.

58
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,626
3 days..

59
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,917
Uncle, that's...

60
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,876
Would you like a glass of water?

61
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:51,042
Three days later,
when we returned home...

62
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,792
...we realized that
mom's gone missing.

63
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,126
- We had to inform the police.

64
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,001
- That's when we found out that...

65
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:03,542
...mom's dead body was found
on a deserted road.

66
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,917
3 kilometers away from Bastar.

67
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,292
- What was she doing in Bastar?

68
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,626
- It's a complete mystery for me...

69
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,542
Avni and the police.

70
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:16,042
I know what you were doing in Bastar.

71
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,417
You came to meet me.

72
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,292
That wasn't my imagination.

73
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,792
That doctor...

74
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:29,542
You paid a high price for
your indiscretions, Vasudha.

75
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:39,001
A shameless woman like her
was bound to meet this fate.

76
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,376
Right?

77
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:46,542
Brazen woman, her body
was found on a deserted road.

78
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,042
Enough!Enough!

79
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:51,126
- Saanj.
-Enough!

80
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,042
Not a word more.
- Saanj what are you...

81
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:55,042
She's my mother.

82
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,626
Saanj what are you doing?
- Keep your mouth shut...

83
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,292
...or I'll throw you out
in front of everyone.

84
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,001
Avni, why did you get him?
- Because he's family.

85
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,167
He's family?

86
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:06,126
Avni wanted you to be here.

87
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,251
Okay?

88
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,126
She wanted that
we take you to Kashi...

89
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,042
...so you could perform
mom's final rites.

90
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,917
But the truth is...

91
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:20,167
...you're not even worthy
of touching her urn.

92
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,876
I...I’m not worthy?
- Yes.

93
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:27,126
I've more right on her than you.
- What?

94
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,792
She's my wife.

95
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,417
God has given me this right.

96
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,501
What...what right?

97
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,792
Now I understand why...

98
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:40,042
...she came to see me this morning.

99
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:44,876
She was wearing a red sweater,
wasn't she?

100
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,126
It was red, wasn't it?

101
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:53,167
Your mother's ashes
won't be immersed in Ganga.

102
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,292
lam her husband.

103
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,251
I will decide..
- Get out.

104
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:58,001
Saanj!

105
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,292
Saanj wait!
- Get out.

106
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,542
Saanj, listen to me.
- Get out.

107
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,167
Get out.
- Saanj!

108
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,876
Vashudha won't be
immersed in Ganga.

109
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,126
- Hello, welcome to
Mumbai Police Control..

110
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:44,542
Avni, what's going on?

111
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,292
I'm sorry, Saanj.

112
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,292
You were right.

113
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,126
I shouldn't have brought him here.

114
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,792
I should've just...

115
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:01,126
He's disappeared with mom's urn...

116
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,042
...and he's left that.

117
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,417
"Son, your mother's ashes
won't be immersed in Ganga."

118
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,917
"I'm taking them where
they rightfully belong."

119
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,792
"Read this book carefully."

120
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,167
"I've written everyone's truth in it."

121
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:35,417
"As it had happened..."

122
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,376
Saanj.

123
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:13,042
Saanj! Good morning.
- Good morning.

124
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:16,126
Whose birthday is it today?
- Mine.

125
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,042
Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

126
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:21,917
And look what your father
has sent for you.

127
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,917
What is this?
- Computer.

128
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,292
Nice?
- Very nice.

129
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,126
You like?
- Very like.

130
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,167
And papa?

131
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:47,126
Papa will be back soon.

132
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:55,376
Like I said, papa's far
away working for his country.

133
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,167
Work! Work! Work!

134
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,917
Mom what kind of work does he do,
that never ends?

135
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:06,917
Look what God has sent to wish Saanj.

136
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:10,292
Flower.
- Red beautiful flowers, no?

137
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:11,792
Yes.

138
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,917
Saanj. You got Scared?

139
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,542
Don't be scared.

140
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:23,292
Don't ever be scared of these sounds.

141
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:28,751
God talks to us through these storms.

142
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,501
He touches us...

143
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,876
...through the color of
these flowers and their fragrance.

144
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,167
Understand?

145
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,542
Thank you, God!

146
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:49,042
Thank you, God!

147
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,542
You need to get to school,
and I've to get to work.

148
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:52,167
Let's go. Let's go.

149
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:02,042
India's most eligible bachelor
Aarav Ruparel is in town.

150
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,376
Really?
- Yeah.

151
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:05,792
By the way, who is Aarav Ruparel?

152
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,126
Huh? You don't know?

153
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,251
This man doesn't have a house...

154
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,917
...but he owns 108 hotels.

155
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,667
Read the newspaper.

156
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,792
You know what he says...

157
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:21,126
...that his permanent address
is the flight seat no. 1A.

158
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,292
How cool, right?

159
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:27,126
- He's going to check into our
presidential suite in the next 2 hours.

160
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:30,042
And you've been given orders
by the management...

161
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:33,542
to make it special and pretty.

162
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,751
Good morning..
- Good morning, Mr. Ruparel.

163
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:40,001
Welcome to the palace Hotel.

164
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,001
Beautiful!

165
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,167
I could die for these.

166
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:15,042
Good morning, Mr. Ruparel.

167
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:17,667
What are these flowers called?

168
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,792
Arum lily.

169
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,251
Arum lily!

170
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,376
Which means simplicity, innocence...

171
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,167
...true love.

172
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,126
They are lovely.

173
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:33,792
It looks like you love your job.

174
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,251
Yes.

175
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,542
But how can you tell?

176
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,417
From the way you
arranged these flowers.

177
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,417
A person's character and
emotions reflect in their work.

178
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,626
Vasu...?

179
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,292
Vasudha.

180
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,917
Keep up the good work.

181
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,542
Thank you, Mr. Ruparel.

182
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,126
Good day.

183
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,792
Vasudha?

184
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,042
Yes.

185
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,917
Is there anything you
don't like about your job?

186
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,417
I didn't understand?

187
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:07,876
You heard me.
What do you hate about your job?

188
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:12,001
Plucking of these flowers.

189
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:17,042
Whether it's for humans or God.

190
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,251
These flowers are so delicate.

191
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,292
Even before they
Can blossom completely...

192
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:26,917
They are plucked from their branches

193
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,042
They've to pay a price
for our happiness...our sorrows...

194
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,751
...our love...

195
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,001
...our achievements...

196
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,792
---by getting plucked.

197
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,126
But nothing can be done.

198
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,542
For years, this job's
been providing for my family.

199
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:46,501
You're right.

200
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,167
A lot has to be
sacrificed to run a house.

201
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,126
It was nice meeting you, Vasudha.

202
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,917
Thank you, Mr. Ruparel.

203
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,626
And please put up the
"Do Not Disturb" sign on the door.

204
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,292
I haven't slept for 18 hours.
- Sure.

205
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,792
Leaving early today, Vasudha?

206
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,251
Where's your share for
the annual staff party.

207
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,542
Oh yes...

208
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,251
Ms. Chubby was saying...

209
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,126
that your husband
won't be accompanying you...

210
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,792
...to the staff party
again this year. Why?

211
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,126
My husband's not in the city.

212
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,667
The luxury taxi business
is so unpredictable.

213
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:47,792
He's either in one city or the other.

214
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,376
One city...or another.

215
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:54,792
I hope he hasn't got something
going on the outside.

216
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,667
Trilok, next time
stay within your limits...

217
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,167
...while cracking a joke.

218
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,542
Sorry.

219
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:10,917
Listen...
Listen.

220
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:12,917
Fire alarm!

221
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,001
Get going!

222
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,501
Everyone get out!
Fire alarm! Come on!

223
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,626
Come on! Hurry up!
Quick!

224
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:27,501
Get everyone out!

225
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:32,042
Move out! Move out!
Clear the building!

226
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,167
Trilok!
- Yes, Vasudha.

227
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:38,417
I think that the guest in the
Presidential suite is still asleep.

228
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,542
He'll hear the alarm
and get out safely.

229
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,417
You're the hotel's security in-charge,
how can you...

230
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:43,876
So? Should I risk my life?

231
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,001
Die in there?

232
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,792
You stay here, I am going.

233
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,792
Save your life first!

234
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,042
Where are you going?

235
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,251
Evacuation's been ordered.
- Coming.

236
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,876
Sir...ma'am, fire exit to the left.
- OK, thank you.

237
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,751
Mr. Ruparel!

238
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,751
Mr. Ruparel!

239
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,542
Mr. Ruparel!

240
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:11,667
Mr...

241
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:18,876
Mr. Ruparel,
there's a fire in the hotel, and...

242
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,876
Mr. Ruparel.

243
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,001
Apoorva, guess what?

244
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:25,876
Our drama was a success.

245
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:27,917
Get the staff to my room now.

246
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:30,751
And for God's sake,
put off the fire alarm.

247
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,251
Apoorva!

248
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:42,876
Aarav!

249
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,501
This is the core team.

250
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,917
Good afternoon sir.

251
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,876
And that is head of security.

252
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,792
Sir, Trilok Sandhu.

253
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:55,542
Vasudha, this is Apoorva.

254
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,167
My childhood friend
and business manager.

255
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:01,167
And Apoorva, meet Vasudha.

256
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,001
- Hi.

257
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,167
The florist.

258
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,167
- Or should I call her a soldier...

259
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:14,167
...who has no connection
with our security staff.

260
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:16,792
Am I right, Mr. Manager?

261
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:18,501
Yes, Mr. Ruparel.

262
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,792
Of course I'm right.

263
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,917
I don't own 108 hotels by chance.

264
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:27,501
Before buying any new hotel,
I ensure...

265
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,792
...that all the systems in
the hotel are working properly.

266
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,417
And I am really sorry to say,
Mr. Bhatia...

267
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:42,292
...that a VVIP guest was rescued 10
minutes after the fire alarm rang.

268
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,667
The security systems and staff
should be replaced immediately.

269
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:48,792
Sorry, sir.
- Sorry, sir.

270
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:49,792
I'm done.

271
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,417
Sorry... Mr. Ruparel...
- You can all leave, thank you.

272
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:00,667
Vasudha.
- Yes, Mr. Ruparel.

273
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,001
I'm very impressed with you.

274
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,917
- Putting others before yourself.

275
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:07,126
The entire hotel industry
business thrives on these principles.

276
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:08,917
And I am glad you believe in that.

277
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,792
Apoorva, I think we
should take her from here.

278
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:15,126
She can take our
new hotel in Dubai to greater heights.

279
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,501
- Of course.

280
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:19,126
From now on you won't
work for anyone else.

281
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,917
Double the salary...

282
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,626
...with all the perks included.

283
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,126
Thank you very much Mr. Ruparel.

284
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,167
It's a great offer, really!

285
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,751
It's not easy to
refuse all that money.

286
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,792
But my family's right here...

287
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,876
...and I cannot leave them.

288
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:44,626
That's why...

289
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,792
I never make the same offer twice.

290
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,417
But for you I'm making an exception.

291
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,792
The offer is still open.

292
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,876
You can come work
for us whenever you want.

293
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,917
Thank you.
- Alright.

294
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,042
Good day.

295
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,792
She should've taken my offer.

296
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,042
- Vasudha...

297
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,917
Why aren't you answering your phone?

298
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,542
Ohh...maybe I didn't
hear it in all the commotion...

299
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,167
Saanj's school called.

300
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:22,501
They took him to Bandra Crime Branch.

301
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,417
What?

302
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,626
- Madam, where are you going?

303
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,917
- Wait. Stop!

304
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,042
- Saanj!

305
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:38,417
Saanj, are you okay?
- Yes.

306
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,917
Your son is very clever.

307
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:44,917
Even at this age,
he knows so much about computers.

308
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,917
At this rate...

309
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,167
...he'll soon be India's Bill Gates.

310
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:53,792
Aren't you ashamed?

311
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,792
You took a small
boy from his school...

312
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,542
...and brought him
to the police station.

313
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,001
What right do you have?

314
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,792
Is he a thief or a criminal?

315
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,751
What has he done?

316
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:08,917
Come, Saanj. Where's your bag?

317
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,792
I'll tell you who's done what.

318
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,126
Shinde, look after the boy.

319
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,292
Yes, sir.

320
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,792
Come with me.

321
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:30,042
You kept coming to us every
month to ask for our help...

322
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,917
...whereas you know
where your husband is.

323
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,501
You've been in touch with him.

324
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,667
For the last 5 years
you kept saying that...

325
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:42,792
...your husband went to Orissa
with an American Journalist...

326
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,917
...and never returned.

327
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:48,001
He disappeared. He's missing.

328
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,251
Isn't that what you said?

329
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:51,417
Yes, sir...

330
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,917
Then what's this?

331
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,251
This birthday card?

332
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,626
What is this?

333
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:02,876
Sir, that's my handwriting.

334
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,417
I write those letters...

335
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:09,001
...in the name of Saanj's father.

336
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:17,667
I lie...that his father's
out of the country for work.

337
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,417
That's the truth behind this letter.

338
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,042
You can punish me any way you want.

339
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:30,167
Punishment doesn't scare me anymore.

340
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:35,626
And I don't need to run from the law.

341
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,876
You shouldn't be running
from the law either.

342
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,501
But things will get
difficult for you...

343
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:45,167
...when your husband returns.

344
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:48,667
Because your husband
isn't driving some taxi.

345
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,001
He's a member of a terrorist group...

346
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,667
...that's spreading
terror in this country.

347
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:58,792
No...you're mistaken, sir.

348
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,001
Hari is...

349
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:03,751
Isn't that him?

350
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,126
He tricked four American
journalists and took them to Orrisa...

351
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:12,751
...to the jungles of bastar...

352
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:15,917
...where he shot them
one after the other.

353
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:19,876
Sir...

354
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,542
Now this case will
become a political issue.

355
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,876
My bosses will want me to arrest you.

356
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,876
But I won't do this.

357
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:35,167
Because I know you're innocent.

358
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:38,001
But in return...

359
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:41,917
...you must inform us...

360
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:44,667
...whenever your husband
comes to see you.

361
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,042
You will have to assist
<i>us</i> in arresting him.

362
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,876
Otherwise...just like your father...

363
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:58,126
...ruined your life by getting you
married to this terrorist...

364
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:03,626
...you'll be ruining your son's life in
order to save your criminal husband.

365
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,542
How can I spend my entire
life with someone I don't know...

366
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,042
Greetings.
- Greetings.

367
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,667
How can I be with someone
I don't love...

368
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,001
Are you crazy?

369
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,792
How dare you utter
such things in front of me?

370
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,001
In our community,
marriage comes first...

371
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:38,001
...and then this thing you call love.

372
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:41,792
For a century our ancestors
have followed this...

373
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:43,876
...and everyone always will.

374
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,251
- Hari is a nice boy.

375
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:50,126
- He's cultured, like me.

376
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,917
- Marry him.

377
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,417
- You'll be happy with him.

378
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:56,917
Enough, Hari.

379
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,542
Enough.
- It's done...it's done.

380
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,001
Almost...

381
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:04,917
If you're so scared of
writing your husband's name...

382
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:07,792
...how will you live with
me for the next seven lives?

383
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,042
It looks so nice.

384
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,417
Now you're mine forever.

385
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:27,126
- Like father...like son!

386
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:30,042
Rascals!

387
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,042
His father was a priest in the temple.

388
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:37,876
And he would beat me up
every night with a shoe.

389
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,876
After he died, my son took over.

390
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:50,001
He said "Mother,
shave your head, it's our tradition."

391
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,667
Even after they're dead...

392
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:57,542
...men still control a woman's body.

393
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,417
Do yourself a favor.

394
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,876
Don't waste your life like me.

395
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:14,001
Don't let the fire
die before you're dead.

396
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:18,126
You're young, beautiful.

397
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:22,667
Go...marry someone else.

398
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,917
And throw your nuptial
necklace in some dustbin.

399
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:31,251
Take that leash off.

400
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:35,876
No, mother.

401
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:45,917
I don't have the courage
to take this off.

402
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,417
We are bound by our traditions.

403
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,417
How can I take it off?

404
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,792
I will wear it till I die.

405
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:01,667
lam happy that my son's with me.

406
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:06,417
I'll hide him in some boarding school.

407
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:08,876
Take him far away from here.

408
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,917
I want to live for him, mother.

409
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:19,876
Go.

410
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,417
- Reputation.

411
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,167
- We can lose money,
but not our reputation.

412
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:29,001
- It's the foundation
of every big organization.

413
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:29,917
- Ours too.

414
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,917
And Mr. Bhatia,
I will never support someone...

415
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,667
...who can malign my reputation.

416
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:39,042
- Such people can't work here.
Fire them.

417
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,751
- Yes, Mr. Ruparel.

418
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,667
- Alright. I'll see you all soon.

419
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:44,251
- Yeah.

420
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:47,042
Thank you.
- Have a safe flight, sir.

421
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:52,417
Bye, Vasu.

422
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:02,542
- What's wrong?

423
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,876
- Your flowers don't look happy today.

424
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,042
Something's wrong.

425
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,876
No, everything's fine.

426
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:19,251
Come on, tell me, I'm listening.

427
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:24,042
Actually...you have already
answered my question.

428
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:28,792
So I don't want to waste your time.

429
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:30,792
By the way...
- Aarav, we've a flight to catch.

430
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:31,417
Yes.

431
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:32,917
I'll just get our bags.

432
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:37,167
I want to hear that question.

433
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:42,167
I had changed my mind.

434
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:47,417
Thought I would take up
the job at your hotel in Dubai.

435
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:51,126
But, since you've
bought this hotel also...

436
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:57,751
...and your reputation
means everything to you...

437
00:29:57,792 --> 00:30:00,876
...it won't be right
for me to even stay here.

438
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,876
My son was just 1 month old...

439
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:10,042
...when my husband left us.

440
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:14,542
I've been waiting
for him since 5 years.

441
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:18,167
But yesterday...

442
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,667
...the police told me that...

443
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:24,042
...he's a member of a terrorist group.

444
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,917
But I didn't know about it.

445
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:31,542
But now that I know, it scares me.

446
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:35,876
This news might
ruin my son's life.

447
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:41,917
So I thought of taking
up the job in your Dubai hotel.

448
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:44,126
Aarav, we'll get stuck in traffic.

449
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:48,251
Apoorva, when I reach Dubai...

450
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,917
...I want to see a beautiful
bouquet made by her in my room.

451
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:56,167
Mr. Ruparel?

452
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:59,001
I don't have any time
for your thank you.

453
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:00,917
I have to catch a flight.

454
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:02,542
I'll see you in Dubai soon.

455
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:03,876
Come on.
- Yup.

456
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,501
Aarav, what was that all about?

457
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,167
What happened?

458
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,167
What's wrong with you?

459
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,667
She reminds me of someone close to me.

460
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:00,542
- And now, ladies and gentlemen.

461
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,667
- Imperial hotel presents on stage...

462
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:09,501
...the sizzling, the ravishing,
the one and only...Rohini!

463
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,167
Sir.

464
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,876
- That was our sizzling
performer Rohini.

465
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:34,917
- I hope you're enjoying this evening,
because I certainly am.

466
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:38,417
- Everybody,
please a huge round of applause.

467
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,751
Get lost!

468
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,626
Get lost from here!

469
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,667
- Why, Aarav?
Why do you enter the hotel?

470
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,792
I've explained to you so many times...

471
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,876
...that I am a cabaret artist.

472
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:07,417
They don't know that I have a son.

473
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:11,167
People will call
me old because of you.

474
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,042
Mom, I've got fever.
I was feeling cold.

475
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:15,542
That's why I came inside.

476
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,542
Where else could I go?

477
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:25,667
You know...

478
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:32,667
...I fled with you from
the hospital when you were born.

479
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:37,542
Because I didn't have
the money to pay the bills.

480
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:41,292
Your father didn't give me a penny.

481
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:44,001
He left nothing before leaving us.

482
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,126
It was really hard to find this job.

483
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:52,292
And I almost lost
it all today because of you.

484
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:57,001
If that happened,
what would we have done?

485
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:59,126
Where would we stay?

486
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,876
How would we survive?

487
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:03,042
Who do we have in this world?

488
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:04,667
- Me.

489
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,042
I've said it...

490
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,001
...me.

491
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:32,542
Higher!

492
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:38,292
Vasudha!

493
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:43,917
Hi.

494
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,001
Vasudha.

495
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:47,917
You?

496
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,126
Naila

497
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,126
Naila Sarwar

498
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,667
I work in the hotel's
house-keeping department.

499
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,001
Nice meeting you.

500
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,876
Shehzad, we need to
go to Miracle Garden first.

501
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:00,751
- Okay, ma'am.

502
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,792
Why? Why not the hotel?

503
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:06,292
Well, our boss has already arrived

504
00:36:06,376 --> 00:36:08,792
and he's waiting there for you.

505
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:29,001
- Good morning, sir.

506
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,292
Good morning, Mr. Ruparel.

507
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,501
Welcome to Dubai.

508
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,042
Thank you.

509
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,792
I know I'm a cruel man.

510
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,542
When it comes to work,
I spare no one.

511
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:41,751
Not even myself.

512
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,542
But the job at hand is special.

513
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:48,751
Come over here,
I want to show you something.

514
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:56,751
My Japanese designers want me...

515
00:36:57,376 --> 00:37:00,417
...to plan the garden
of my new hotel like this one.

516
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,917
But I'm a bit confused.

517
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,417
Should I make an
exact replica, or not.

518
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:10,292
I mean, there are 40,000 flowers here.
It's stunning. It's beautiful.

519
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,501
But I still feel like
Something is missing here.

520
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,042
It lacks something.

521
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:20,001
Can you tell me what's missing?

522
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,626
There are no dried leaves here.

523
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,417
According to me, Mr. Ruparel,
a garden that doesn't have...

524
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:45,292
a few dried leaves, some
withered flowers, doesn't seem real.

525
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:50,417
This place is too beautiful.

526
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:54,667
And maybe that's why
it doesn't touch the heart.

527
00:37:57,292 --> 00:38:00,042
Every beautiful thing
has some flaw in it.

528
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,126
Even the moon has craters.

529
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:07,792
But...why is this garden so flawless?

530
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,292
Amazing.

531
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,042
You answered my question so easily.

532
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:21,417
You surpassed my experts.

533
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:26,292
You okay?

534
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:29,001
Something went into my eye.
- May I?

535
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,417
Thank you.

536
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,626
Naila, I need a sim card.

537
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:03,042
I want to talk to my son.
Please help me get one.

538
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:06,917
Mama, I'm here.
- Saanj!

539
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,376
- I told you.

540
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:11,126
Now we can talk every day for free.

541
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:15,126
- Maddy Aunty took the
principal's permission.

542
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,167
Happy Diwali.

543
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:41,251
- Happy Diwali, sir.

544
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,417
- Happy Diwali, sir.

545
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:46,417
It feels like this place was
covered in darkness until now.

546
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,751
And this is the first time
this place has seen light.

547
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,417
But...how did you manage
all this in so little time?

548
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:56,001
We did it together, sir.

549
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:58,751
Otherwise it would've
not been possible.

550
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:00,501
But the idea was yours.

551
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:06,167
If the light hadn't been in you,
it wouldn't have reflected out here.

552
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:10,917
No matter how many times I thank
you for that, it won't be enough.

553
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:17,001
This is dim in comparison to
the light you've brought to my life.

554
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:19,792
You changed my life.

555
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,626
My son's too.

556
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:25,167
lam a very selfish man.

557
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,251
I only do what makes me happy.

558
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,667
But I would never want
you to consider this a favor.

559
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,751
Or feel burdened.

560
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:36,876
I really mean it.

561
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,501
Goodbye.

562
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:47,001
We'll miss our flight, Aarav.

563
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:48,417
Yeah.

564
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,417
Take care.

565
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:10,792
Vasudha.

566
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:15,042
Can I click a picture of you?

567
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:17,126
Just one snap.

568
00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:19,917
Guys...everyone gather around.

569
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:21,417
For a photo.
- Yes, sir.

570
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,667
For the hotel magazine.
Hurry up.

571
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:30,876
Smile.

572
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:44,667
Come on, everyone back to work.

573
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:53,251
Naila, how often does
Mr. Ruparel come here?

574
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,417
Well...I’ve never counted.

575
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,792
You see, he leads an interesting life.

576
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,626
He comes if he wants to, or doesn't.

577
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:05,167
Sometimes once in three months,
or sometimes once in three years.

578
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:09,626
By the way, madam...
where do I keep these flowers?

579
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,501
There.

580
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:12,626
Pinto.
- Yes, ma'am.

581
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:14,001
Please help me.
- Sure.

582
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:18,751
And the rest of the flowers,
where do I keep them?

583
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:23,667
Naila, will you take that
trolley to the other room.

584
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:24,667
I'll be right with you.

585
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:25,667
- Come fast.

586
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:56,667
Hello.
- Vasudha.

587
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,167
Hi, Aarav.

588
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:05,542
- Listen, the photo I took of
you is a little out of focus.

589
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:08,667
Can you do me a favor?
Can you click one more...

590
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,626
...and send it to me right now?

591
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:14,417
Yeah...you mean, my photo?

592
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:15,626
Yes.

593
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,751
For our hotel magazine.

594
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:20,667
I want to do a profile on you.

595
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:22,792
Okay.

596
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:24,751
I'll click one and give
it to the management.

597
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:26,167
No, send it to me!

598
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:27,751
I'm waiting.

599
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:29,292
- Send it fast please.

600
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:31,376
Yeah. OK.

601
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:32,917
Thanks.Bye.

602
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:40,917
It's all messed up.

603
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:42,751
Follow my instructions.

604
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,626
Look at this...

605
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:30,001
- I don't understand why...

606
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:32,542
a wealthy man like you...

607
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:37,126
...who owns big hotels
all over the world...

608
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:43,417
...is interested
in my 3-star hotel?

609
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:47,417
- And I've told you before...

610
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:50,417
this was the first property...

611
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:54,042
...built by my father
from his hard-earned money.

612
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:58,792
I've an emotional
attachment to this place.

613
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,917
So I can't sell this hotel to you.

614
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:04,251
- Sorry.

615
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,292
Emotions and you.

616
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:13,667
I don't see a speck of
emotion on your ugly face?

617
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,167
What do you mean, Mr. Ruparel?

618
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,792
What's going on, Apoorva?

619
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:23,292
Is this a business meeting or...

620
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,417
...an insulting session?

621
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:32,417
You're humiliating me in my hotel,
in front of my people.

622
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,792
- Think about my age.

623
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:37,792
- I am a heart patient.

624
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:40,667
Leave. Please leave.
Go away.

625
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:42,501
I don't want to sell.

626
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:45,042
I won't sell this hotel.

627
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:50,876
Aarav, let's get to the point.

628
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,542
Fine, let's get to the point.

629
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:01,542
I don't know how you will do it.

630
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,042
But I want your hotel
in a month's time.

631
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:09,167
You will sign this
deal for 600 million...

632
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:11,417
...not a penny more or less.

633
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:15,542
And if you don't do that...

634
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:21,167
...then I'll use all
my influence to ruin you.

635
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:26,792
You and your family will be
begging on the streets of Kolkata.

636
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,001
This shock might...

637
00:50:29,251 --> 00:50:33,042
...even cause a heart-attack
and you'll die on the streets.

638
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:34,667
Believe me...

639
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:38,417
...that'll make me really happy.

640
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,751
- I just can't get Bose's
reaction out of my head.

641
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:54,417
"What's going on, Apoorva?"

642
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:57,417
"ls this a business meeting,
or...an insulting session?"

643
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:00,001
- You should've seen his face.

644
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:05,001
I don't know why seeing the man...

645
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:09,667
...who humiliated me so much
during my childhood and hurt me...

646
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,667
...suffer today,
isn't making me happy.

647
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:17,751
That...that's your problem.

648
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:22,626
This is your problem.
You feel everything so deeply...

649
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,626
...there's so much sorrow inside you.

650
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:27,001
You are always full of pain.

651
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:27,917
Why?

652
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:32,667
Because you don't know
what your heart wants.

653
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:37,251
Mr. Ruparel,
the flight is ready for departure.

654
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:40,417
All the passengers have boarded
and we're waiting for you.

655
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:42,626
Right.
Okay, let's go.

656
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:45,917
- Attention please,
this is the final call...

657
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:50,292
...for the passengers traveling
through flight B-126 to London.

658
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:08,042
What happened?

659
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:11,417
Fragrance.

660
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:14,917
Sir, the flight is about to depart.

661
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,542
Can we please proceed now.

662
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:19,667
Aarav, they're shutting the doors,
man. Come on.

663
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,542
- Aarav!

664
00:52:44,501 --> 00:52:45,917
Aarav, we can't miss this flight.

665
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,667
You know the European
Division is waiting in London.

666
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:48,917
Come on, let's go.

667
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:51,001
Aarav, hurry up. Let's go.

668
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:53,001
We're not going to London.

669
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:56,292
If we're not going to London,
where are we going?

670
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:01,501
You asked me what my heart wanted.

671
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,542
These flowers have
answered your question.

672
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:09,917
We're going to Dubai.

673
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:20,792
Hello.
- Any contact with him?

674
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:23,751
Who? Who is speaking?

675
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:26,292
Patil from Mumbai Crime Branch, ma'am.

676
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,001
No one's contacted me.

677
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:40,042
And how could he,
I haven't given this number to anyone.

678
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:42,126
It's not difficult for
the police or a criminal...

679
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:45,042
...to find anyone's number, ma'am.

680
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:46,542
Anyway...

681
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,751
...I’ll be waiting for your call.
- Yes.

682
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,292
- Happy Diwali!

683
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:18,042
- Wow! What a performance!

684
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:20,626
Very nice! Very nice!

685
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:24,417
- Come on now give them
a big round of applause

686
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:26,001
Okay.

687
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:27,917
Now, I'm going to
spin this bottle again...

688
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:29,417
...round and round...

689
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:38,667
It's spinning...it's spinning!

690
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:40,417
And stop!

691
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:45,417
Our next singer for the evening is...

692
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:06,667
Sorry, sir...

693
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:12,667
...whoever the bottle
points at...has to sing.

694
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:14,542
- But, it's okay...

695
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:16,251
...you're the...

696
00:57:16,251 --> 00:57:17,126
Vasudha!

697
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:25,001
It's pointless to run from the truth.

698
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:34,126
What truth?

699
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:37,417
You and my mother
have a similar story.

700
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:43,667
But after my father left us,
she fell in love with someone else.

701
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:45,792
Jeevan Rane.

702
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:49,792
He was madly in love
with my mother, but...

703
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:56,292
...alcohol ruined him.

704
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,792
He even lost his job because of it.

705
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:03,917
- But even in that
painful poverty...

706
00:58:04,126 --> 00:58:06,417
...we would find our
moments of happiness.

707
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:11,792
- We would get so happy when she
would steal food for me from that club.

708
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,292
- And alcohol for Jeevan uncle.

709
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:18,542
- The world saw that as theft,
but to us it was love.

710
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:22,001
- And then one day
that incident took place...

711
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:24,417
...which completely shattered us.

712
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,917
Wait.
- What happened?

713
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:28,792
Show me your bag,
- Why?

714
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:30,001
- I said show me your bag.

715
00:58:30,042 --> 00:58:31,417
Let go.
- What's wrong?

716
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:32,792
Sir, I told you before...

717
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,376
...this woman steals whiskey
bottles from our bar.

718
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:37,542
He's lying. I didn't steal anything.
- Show me your bag.

719
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:39,042
I don't steal.
- Give me your bag.

720
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:43,751
Look, sir.
- Hold this.

721
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:44,792
You thief!

722
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:46,042
Let her go. Let her go.

723
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,167
Let him go,
he hasn't done anything.

724
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:49,667
It's my fault.

725
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:50,792
Aarav!

726
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:53,376
- Let them go.
It's my fault.

727
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:54,792
Let them go.

728
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,542
- She often faced
humiliation in that hotel.

729
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:02,042
- But she was never so
disgraced as she was that night.

730
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:10,251
- When we were returning,
Jeevan uncle did...

731
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:15,667
...what many people in our
country do due to poverty and grief.

732
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:16,917
- Stop the car.

733
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,542
- Stop. We need help.

734
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:31,667
- That was the scariest
night of my life.

735
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:35,542
I saw a weak man get destroyed
because of his shame.

736
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:40,417
That night I swore to be successful...

737
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,751
...and took my first step
towards becoming successful.

738
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,542
But this success doesn't
take away the pain.

739
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:58,042
That pain still exists...even today.

740
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:05,042
That day when I made
you talk to your son...

741
01:00:05,792 --> 01:00:07,751
...and saw the happiness on your face.

742
01:00:09,292 --> 01:00:13,917
I realized that pain reduces
when you give happiness...

743
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:17,001
Sorrows reduce when you give joy.

744
01:00:18,917 --> 01:00:22,792
Vasudha, I want to make
a deal with you.

745
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:26,292
I want to give you all
the happiness in the world...

746
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:29,501
...in exchange for your pain.

747
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:33,626
Vasudha, it's your love...

748
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:41,001
...that made my heart
see the light beyond my darkness.

749
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:48,917
Thank you.

750
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:53,126
I love you a lot, Vasudha.

751
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,542
"Now you're mine forever."

752
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:50,167
Sir. Sir, sorry to disturb you, sir.

753
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:51,251
Vasudha.

754
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:53,917
What is this?

755
01:02:56,126 --> 01:03:00,917
"Naila, by the time you wake up,
I would've already left."

756
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:03,542
"Don't ask why."

757
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:08,917
"My condition is like the
traveler wandering in the desert..."

758
01:03:09,501 --> 01:03:14,376
"...that sees water,
but it turns out to be a mirage."

759
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,417
"Just a figment of his imagination."

760
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:20,667
"Last night I was deceived."

761
01:03:21,417 --> 01:03:24,792
"So...I am leaving without
informing the management."

762
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,417
"Look after yourself, Naila."

763
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:28,792
"Thank you."

764
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:38,792
Vasudha, where are you going?

765
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:40,417
Away from you.

766
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:43,001
Me...or my love?

767
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,417
Why?

768
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:52,667
Because you're mistaking
your lust for love.

769
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:57,417
What did you say?
- Yes, Mr. Aarav Ruparel

770
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:02,001
The world is like a toy shop for you.

771
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:04,167
You can buy anything you like.

772
01:04:04,292 --> 01:04:06,001
But I am not for sale.

773
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:11,126
You did all this to escape
your lonely and boring life.

774
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,667
And I was such a fool to think that...

775
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:16,292
...I had come here for my own needs.

776
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:19,417
I am not some coin
lying on the street.

777
01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:24,626
I belong to someone else.

778
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:27,667
Do you get that?
- No.

779
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:31,292
I don't understand
these big talks, Vasudha.

780
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:34,251
All I understand is this.

781
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,042
You know me really well, don't you?

782
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:38,542
Understand me.

783
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,792
But do you understand yourself?

784
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:42,251
No, Vasudha.

785
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:44,042
You love me too. A lot.

786
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:45,501
But you will never say it.

787
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:48,126
You will yearn for me,
but never express it.

788
01:04:48,376 --> 01:04:49,792
You'll keep running from me.

789
01:04:50,126 --> 01:04:52,626
Wander in that desert in your heart.

790
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:54,167
You want to come closer to me.

791
01:04:54,501 --> 01:04:56,376
Wrap your arms around me and cry,
make a place in my heart!

792
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:57,501
But you won't do it.

793
01:05:00,042 --> 01:05:01,667
But I'm not like you.

794
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:06,542
I can't live without
telling you that I love you.

795
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,501
That I need you.

796
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:13,126
What could hurt me more...

797
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:16,917
...than knowing that life
scares you more than death...

798
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:19,376
...love scares you, not loneliness.

799
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:37,542
I can't fall in love.

800
01:05:39,376 --> 01:05:41,667
I can't feel anything.

801
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:49,042
Go away.

802
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:52,542
You're wrong about me.

803
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,751
I'll take you back to your home.

804
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:02,417
But first I want to
take you somewhere, Vasudha.

805
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,042
After that you can
make your decisions.

806
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:40,292
A failed attempt to commit suicide...

807
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:42,376
...another failure.

808
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,501
Jeevan uncle couldn't
endure the brain trauma...

809
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,167
...and slipped into a coma.

810
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:51,501
Doctors said he'll have to
spend the rest of his life like this.

811
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:55,542
He even told mom to take him off
all his life-support systems...

812
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:58,376
...but mom didn't agree.

813
01:07:00,376 --> 01:07:02,542
And I still remember what she said.

814
01:07:03,501 --> 01:07:05,417
She said "Love is a responsibility..."

815
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:08,542
"...and only the
fortunate ones get it."

816
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:11,292
For the last 20 years,
she has spent

817
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:14,167
- hours here everyday
to hear his heartbeat.

818
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:19,167
She even says that Jeevan uncle...

819
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:22,042
...gives her marks for
her piano performance.

820
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:23,667
- Sweet, isn't it?

821
01:07:33,626 --> 01:07:35,667
So how many marks did
you get today, ma?

822
01:07:35,876 --> 01:07:36,917
Aarav!

823
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:43,167
Zero marks and it's all your fault.

824
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:47,542
My heart was saying that
you're somewhere close...

825
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:50,376
...and so I couldn't impress him.

826
01:07:57,042 --> 01:08:00,501
Who's this wandering
soul that feels like a kindred spirit?

827
01:08:02,251 --> 01:08:04,292
Ma, I've brought her here today...

828
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:07,126
...so that you can defend my case.

829
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:10,667
I want to give her and her son...

830
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:13,501
...the life that you and I never had.

831
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:14,292
Come.

832
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:19,542
I want to marry her, give her love.

833
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,292
But she doesn't trust me.

834
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:31,417
You can call this a plea, if you want.

835
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,042
But the heart doesn't
stop for everyone.

836
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:37,917
Even heartbeats have rules.

837
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:44,042
We're told the story
of Sita from childhood.

838
01:08:44,876 --> 01:08:48,167
We're taught to be like her.

839
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,542
But no one talks about Radha.

840
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:57,376
Whereas she's the one revered
along with Krishna, in every home.

841
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:00,542
So think about it.

842
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:03,417
You won't get this time back again.

843
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:06,542
Life doesn't give a second chance.

844
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:09,917
Love's in front of you.

845
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:13,042
Don't run from it.

846
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:16,792
What good will that do?

847
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:20,042
Make you pious?

848
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:21,792
Become Sita?

849
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:25,001
But you've always been that.

850
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:28,292
When will you become Radha?

851
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:44,501
I don't have the courage
to see you leave.

852
01:09:46,376 --> 01:09:49,417
Apoorva will take you back
to Mumbai by the next flight.

853
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:52,792
I'm not coming.

854
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:58,126
Bye.

855
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:15,417
No one has ever given me
as much respect...

856
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:20,792
...as you did today,
in front of your mother.

857
01:10:23,501 --> 01:10:25,126
I'm tired, Aarav.

858
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,792
My past has cornered me.

859
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:36,251
Can you help me forget my past?

860
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:41,042
I don't know how to live.

861
01:10:44,042 --> 01:10:46,042
Can you teach me how to live?

862
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:50,126
I don't know how to love.

863
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:57,001
Can you teach me what love is?

864
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:36,542
Bye.

865
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:38,126
Bye.

866
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:44,542
Don't forget to come tomorrow morning.

867
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:48,167
I've called my lawyer over
for something important.

868
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,042
For what?

869
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:54,542
This.

870
01:14:58,042 --> 01:14:59,417
Divorce papers.

871
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:02,376
Read them properly and sign them.

872
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:08,667
Next time, I want to meet
Saanj as his legal guardian.

873
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:12,751
I don't like hiding things.

874
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:05,126
No!

875
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:08,167
No, no, no...

876
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,292
Don't... don't...

877
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:12,751
Don't...

878
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:16,167
I'm not dead! I'm not dead!

879
01:17:17,542 --> 01:17:19,042
It's me.

880
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:21,042
Hari!

881
01:17:21,626 --> 01:17:23,376
Don't...

882
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:25,542
Vasudha.

883
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,042
It's me, Vasudha.

884
01:17:40,876 --> 01:17:43,292
I'm hungry-

885
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:45,751
Do you have something to eat?

886
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:50,001
I'm hungry.
Do you have something to eat?

887
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:54,167
Do you have something to eat?
I'm hungry.

888
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:02,251
What...?

889
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:08,251
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

890
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:12,042
There's no food at home.
- Huh!

891
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:14,292
No food at home.

892
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:19,001
Go. Come back soon.

893
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:56,417
Madam do you need something?

894
01:18:57,042 --> 01:18:58,292
Madam?

895
01:19:13,042 --> 01:19:17,667
- The number you've dialed is not
accepting any calls at this moment.

896
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:20,042
- Please try again later.

897
01:19:20,042 --> 01:19:21,292
- Thank you.

898
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:56,626
I've yearned 5 years for this love.

899
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:05,792
What happened?

900
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:11,917
Vasudha, I'm your husband.

901
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:17,626
The police were saying...

902
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,042
...you're a terrorist.

903
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:28,501
If I don't tell them...

904
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:33,417
...that you're back...

905
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:38,792
...then they will arrest me too.

906
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:41,876
Then Saanj...

907
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:49,042
You believe the police.

908
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:52,792
You never bothered to
ask me my side of the story.

909
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:55,042
What happened to me?

910
01:20:55,876 --> 01:20:58,167
Vasudha, I was taken prisoner...

911
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:01,042
...along with those Americans.

912
01:21:01,876 --> 01:21:03,751
When we were heading towards Bastar...

913
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,042
- on the highway.

914
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:10,042
- They attacked our
car and took us hostage.

915
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,042
- They scared me, threatened me.

916
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:13,626
"Kill them. Come on."

917
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:18,126
Forced me to kill one
of those Americans.

918
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,376
- They shot the entire thing on video
and sent it to the police.

919
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:22,417
Shoot!

920
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:26,792
- They would thrash me every day.

921
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:29,292
- Tell me to forget my past.

922
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:31,751
- And I was one of them.

923
01:21:32,042 --> 01:21:34,501
- One day those beasts...

924
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:37,417
...camped at Father
Peter Dayal's hermitage.

925
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:39,751
- I told father my story...

926
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:43,167
...and asked him
for his help to escape.

927
01:21:43,751 --> 01:21:45,042
- He helped me.

928
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:46,751
- Come on. Fast...move.

929
01:21:46,876 --> 01:21:48,917
- And we all escaped.

930
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:52,792
- But the entire area
was rigged with land mines.

931
01:21:59,501 --> 01:22:00,917
- They caught us again.

932
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:04,792
- And to punish us, they shot Father
and me in the leg.

933
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:08,542
- They kept me locked in
the same room for years.

934
01:22:08,876 --> 01:22:14,251
- Remember, when I was leaving,
and you were praying for my safety.

935
01:22:15,626 --> 01:22:18,167
- Those were the memories
that kept me sane.

936
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:20,126
- Kept me alive.

937
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:24,417
- I swore that I
won't die at any cost.

938
01:22:24,876 --> 01:22:26,417
- And I'll return home.

939
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:35,251
- God answered my prayers.

940
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,751
- The place where they were
camping was hit by floods.

941
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:42,042
- And I got another chance to run.

942
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:46,001
I kept running.

943
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:49,542
- It took me months to get here.

944
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:54,251
No one believes me.

945
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:55,667
No one.

946
01:22:56,751 --> 01:22:58,292
You don't believe me either.

947
01:23:03,126 --> 01:23:04,667
I do now.

948
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:22,792
Vasudha.

949
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:26,751
Arrange for a car.

950
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:28,667
We'll get out of here.

951
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:30,792
Leave this city.

952
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:33,542
We'll start a new life...

953
01:23:39,042 --> 01:23:40,292
What's wrong with you?

954
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:41,292
What...?

955
01:23:50,126 --> 01:23:52,751
Who's calling you at this hour?

956
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,751
Who is he?

957
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:12,042
Who's calling you?

958
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:14,126
Who is he, Vasudha?

959
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:16,042
Who is he?

960
01:24:19,001 --> 01:24:20,376
Aarav.

961
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:26,417
I work for him.

962
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:29,792
He wants to marry me.

963
01:24:41,001 --> 01:24:42,417
Aren't you ashamed?

964
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:48,292
Your father taught
values all his life.

965
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,792
How could those values
give birth to such a woman?

966
01:24:58,251 --> 01:25:00,042
I want to strangle you.

967
01:25:00,751 --> 01:25:02,751
Kill Saanj and myself too.

968
01:25:03,792 --> 01:25:07,751
If you feel nothing for me,
what will I live for?

969
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:10,167
It's all...all over!

970
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:16,042
Didn't your conscience stop you?

971
01:25:16,292 --> 01:25:18,167
Didn't your God stop you?

972
01:25:18,376 --> 01:25:20,792
Didn't our memories stop you?

973
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:28,251
Which memories, Hari?

974
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:36,167
The time when you forcefully...

975
01:25:36,667 --> 01:25:38,792
...tattooed your name on my arm.

976
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:46,292
Just like a master brands his pet.

977
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:53,417
We'd been married for just a year,
when you disappeared.

978
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:57,626
Can you imagine the loneliness...

979
01:25:58,042 --> 01:26:02,042
...that I felt in the last five years?

980
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:06,792
Do you know how I raised our son?

981
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:11,167
But you're so engrossed
in your pain...

982
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:13,501
...that you can't see me.

983
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:17,167
Because if you could, Hari...

984
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:25,376
...you wouldn't have asked
me to run away with you.

985
01:26:26,126 --> 01:26:28,501
And what's the point
of running away, Hari?

986
01:26:29,792 --> 01:26:31,126
We can't escape.

987
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:36,542
So Hari...

988
01:26:39,126 --> 01:26:41,167
...stop thinking about me.

989
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:46,292
Go to the police station
and tell them the truth.

990
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:50,501
I am sure you'll get justice.

991
01:26:51,251 --> 01:26:53,042
For Saanj's sake.

992
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,667
His future is at stake.

993
01:26:58,042 --> 01:26:59,626
Wow, Vasudha...

994
01:27:01,667 --> 01:27:03,542
...you took Saanj's name.

995
01:27:05,251 --> 01:27:07,542
But it's that rich boss of
yours that you're thinking about.

996
01:27:10,501 --> 01:27:12,751
You're restless to see him.

997
01:27:17,042 --> 01:27:18,126
Have...

998
01:27:20,126 --> 01:27:22,042
Have you slept with him?

999
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:27,042
Have you slept with him?

1000
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:32,667
I love him.

1001
01:27:34,126 --> 01:27:35,251
A lot...

1002
01:27:57,792 --> 01:27:58,751
Hari!

1003
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:00,876
Hari!

1004
01:28:01,001 --> 01:28:02,167
Hari, come inside.

1005
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:04,751
Hari, don't go anywhere.

1006
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:06,042
Leave me!

1007
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:07,667
Hari.
- Let go!

1008
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:09,292
Go to your boss.

1009
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:11,167
Hey...how dare you hit your wife?

1010
01:28:11,251 --> 01:28:12,292
Shinde...

1011
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:14,167
Go to your boss.

1012
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:17,251
Sir, he's my husband.
- Leave me!

1013
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:23,042
Go back to your boss!

1014
01:28:32,376 --> 01:28:34,501
Go back to your boss!
- Hari!

1015
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,251
You haven't seen the news.

1016
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:56,292
Aarav... here.

1017
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:58,876
Sources from Mumbai Crime
Branch have confirmed...

1018
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:03,292
...that the person arrested
last night for a scuffle...

1019
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:05,292
...with his wife and the police...

1020
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:07,251
...is Hari Prasad.
- That's Vasudha's husband.

1021
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:09,167
And he's a member of
the same terrorist group...

1022
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:14,542
...that killed 5 American
journalists 5 years ago.

1023
01:29:14,626 --> 01:29:16,667
The police have been
looking for him for 5 years.

1024
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:18,751
Hari Prasad was arrested arguing...

1025
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:21,167
...outside his Azad
Nagar Home in Andheri.

1026
01:29:21,501 --> 01:29:23,292
Aarav...the police was here.

1027
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:25,667
They want to know
if Vasudha is involved.

1028
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:28,667
It's high time, man.
I think you should just...

1029
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:29,626
Should do what?

1030
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:31,417
I think you should just tell...

1031
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:36,667
Aarav.

1032
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:44,292
Aarav...

1033
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:51,126
Hari...is innocent.

1034
01:29:53,876 --> 01:29:55,417
He hasn't done anything.

1035
01:29:58,042 --> 01:29:59,876
The police took him away.

1036
01:30:00,792 --> 01:30:02,501
Aarav, save him.

1037
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:07,792
Aarav, save him.
He hasn't done anything.

1038
01:30:08,251 --> 01:30:09,751
He's innocent.

1039
01:30:10,126 --> 01:30:11,792
Aarav, save him.

1040
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:14,042
Aarav, save him.

1041
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:18,001
Save him!

1042
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,167
- Mr. Deshmukh, I want to know...

1043
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:28,542
...whether this country will be
run by law or by your will?

1044
01:30:28,792 --> 01:30:30,126
What happened?

1045
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:32,417
She says her husband is innocent.

1046
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:34,751
He's been framed.

1047
01:30:35,126 --> 01:30:39,167
He didn't commit the
crimes you're accusing him of.

1048
01:30:40,126 --> 01:30:41,667
So let's get to the point.

1049
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:43,751
You're the Home Minister.

1050
01:30:44,001 --> 01:30:45,376
Elections are just around the corner.

1051
01:30:45,751 --> 01:30:48,417
I'm sure you'll need donations.

1052
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,542
Name your price.

1053
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:53,542
You will get the
money within the hour.

1054
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:56,792
Keep the money and release Hari.

1055
01:30:57,292 --> 01:31:00,417
The further he stays from
these political games, the better.

1056
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:04,417
But, Mr. Ruparel, Hari isn't innocent.

1057
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:07,542
We have evidence against him.

1058
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:12,417
Mr. Patil,
you seem to be a sensible person.

1059
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:14,917
You can continue working
for your department...

1060
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:17,376
...without becoming puppets
for these politicians.

1061
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:21,667
So please...don't give them
your shoulder to target this woman.

1062
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:26,167
Because this entire charade
is only to stay in the headlines.

1063
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:30,126
You're absolutely right.

1064
01:31:30,667 --> 01:31:33,292
I ordered Patil to
arrest her husband...

1065
01:31:33,376 --> 01:31:35,626
...and give the news to the media.

1066
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:38,751
What to do? Elections are close.

1067
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:41,167
I need to be in the headlines.

1068
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:42,792
And another truth is...

1069
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:45,626
...her husband came
to the Crime Branch today...

1070
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,667
...and accepted his crimes.

1071
01:31:49,626 --> 01:31:54,417
And matter of fact,
we have a written statement also...

1072
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:57,042
...which also bears his sign.

1073
01:31:57,417 --> 01:31:59,542
You can ask Mr. Patil.

1074
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:02,667
Patil?
- Yeah, he's right.

1075
01:32:03,126 --> 01:32:05,417
I tried talking to your husband.

1076
01:32:05,751 --> 01:32:08,042
I also told him the
consequences of this statement.

1077
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:11,792
But he said...he's doing
it for your happiness.

1078
01:32:11,917 --> 01:32:14,626
So that he can stay away...

1079
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:18,417
...and you can be happy
with Mr. Ruparel.

1080
01:32:21,292 --> 01:32:23,667
I see...so that's the case.

1081
01:32:25,501 --> 01:32:28,417
I thought I was a lowly man.

1082
01:32:28,792 --> 01:32:32,751
I was using her husband
for my own benefit.

1083
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:35,501
But this is just amazing.

1084
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:38,042
We're all the same.

1085
01:32:38,751 --> 01:32:40,167
Right, Mr. Ruparel.

1086
01:32:40,501 --> 01:32:42,751
A poor man's wife
is everyone's missus.

1087
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:49,001
Listen...take my advice.

1088
01:32:49,376 --> 01:32:52,292
That obsession of love in your eyes...

1089
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:55,751
...has ruined many kings and emperors.

1090
01:32:56,542 --> 01:33:01,042
So don't ruin yourself
for these stupid emotions.

1091
01:33:01,417 --> 01:33:06,751
Well...I’ll forget everything you said.

1092
01:33:07,292 --> 01:33:08,751
What do they call it?

1093
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:12,042
Consider it a child's obstinacy.

1094
01:33:12,376 --> 01:33:14,417
Do you understand?
- You?

1095
01:33:18,001 --> 01:33:21,292
Okay, I'm done talking.

1096
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:23,417
Let's fight.
- Aarav.

1097
01:33:23,876 --> 01:33:27,376
Get ready to fight the biggest
battle of your life, Deshmukh.

1098
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:31,751
Because I promise...
I will get Hari out...

1099
01:33:31,792 --> 01:33:34,292
...even with his signed statement.

1100
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,542
No matter what means I use,
right or wrong...

1101
01:33:36,626 --> 01:33:37,792
...he will come out.

1102
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:40,126
And you'll just watch.

1103
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:41,292
Aarav, let's go.

1104
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:43,167
Aarav, come.

1105
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:46,626
Vasudha, let's go.

1106
01:33:47,501 --> 01:33:48,376
Come.

1107
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:52,042
I want the best lawyer for this case.

1108
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:54,292
Robin Salve.
He handled Mehta's case.

1109
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:56,667
But we'll have to pay a
huge fee to get him on this case.

1110
01:33:56,792 --> 01:33:58,501
He doesn't like such
anti-national cases.

1111
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:00,167
Money is not the problem, Apoorva.

1112
01:34:02,417 --> 01:34:03,376
Just get him.

1113
01:34:06,376 --> 01:34:07,042
Lets go.

1114
01:34:16,792 --> 01:34:18,792
Everyone's fighting because of me.

1115
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:24,126
Hari put the noose around his neck.

1116
01:34:25,376 --> 01:34:27,751
You're prepared to
fight against the world.

1117
01:34:29,751 --> 01:34:34,417
And I'm just watching
everything like a coward.

1118
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:41,292
With a hope that
everything will be fine.

1119
01:34:43,126 --> 01:34:45,042
But I'm done with this cowardice.

1120
01:34:46,042 --> 01:34:52,876
I won't build my world
on Hari's dead body.

1121
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:57,917
After his sacrifice..

1122
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:01,792
I can never be happy with you...

1123
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:09,292
I have loved you a lot...

1124
01:35:10,626 --> 01:35:12,501
...and I can't do this.

1125
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,417
To build a heaven for myself

1126
01:35:18,042 --> 01:35:20,167
...I can't push you in this hell

1127
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:34,792
Sir...

1128
01:36:37,751 --> 01:36:39,542
I did what you asked me to do.

1129
01:36:40,876 --> 01:36:42,417
This hotel now belongs to you.

1130
01:36:44,376 --> 01:36:49,167
I apologize for my
indecent behavior.

1131
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:55,126
You were the owner of this hotel...

1132
01:36:57,667 --> 01:36:59,626
...and you always will be.

1133
01:38:13,042 --> 01:38:15,292
- In light of all the evidence...

1134
01:38:15,417 --> 01:38:21,751
...the court finds Hari Prasad
guilty under section IPC 302...

1135
01:38:22,292 --> 01:38:25,667
...and gives him the death sentence.

1136
01:38:26,417 --> 01:38:28,667
- To be hanged till death.

1137
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:39,292
Hari!

1138
01:38:39,917 --> 01:38:40,751
Hari!

1139
01:38:41,751 --> 01:38:43,917
Hari, why didn't you say something?

1140
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:47,417
Hari, tell them everything
that happened in Bastar.

1141
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:50,542
Tell them about Father
Peter Dayal, Hari.

1142
01:38:50,667 --> 01:38:53,292
Hari, tell them the truth.

1143
01:38:53,417 --> 01:38:54,542
Hari!

1144
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:11,417
Hello.
- Mr. Ruparel, this is Robin Salve.

1145
01:40:12,001 --> 01:40:14,042
ACP Patil wants to talk to you.

1146
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:15,751
I don't understand.

1147
01:40:15,792 --> 01:40:17,167
- Sir he wants to meet you.

1148
01:40:17,917 --> 01:40:19,292
- He wants to see you.

1149
01:40:19,917 --> 01:40:21,542
He") me?

1150
01:40:22,667 --> 01:40:23,751
Why?

1151
01:40:24,667 --> 01:40:27,792
Because even the universe
helps true lovers...

1152
01:40:29,167 --> 01:40:33,417
So I decided to make a small effort
in trying to unite Vasudha and you.

1153
01:40:33,917 --> 01:40:37,542
Vasudha came to see Hari every day...

1154
01:40:38,167 --> 01:40:41,251
...and pleaded with him to
withdraw his statement.

1155
01:40:42,167 --> 01:40:45,292
But Hari has been treating
her like an animal.

1156
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:48,417
He shunned all her efforts.

1157
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:52,542
I spoke to Hari after Vasudha left.

1158
01:40:53,417 --> 01:40:59,001
Why admit to a crime
you never committed?

1159
01:41:01,917 --> 01:41:03,917
Why do you want to
hang from the noose?

1160
01:41:04,251 --> 01:41:06,167
Because I don't have a choice.

1161
01:41:07,292 --> 01:41:09,167
I want my wife back.

1162
01:41:10,292 --> 01:41:13,292
She's mine.
I will get hanged for her.

1163
01:41:13,917 --> 01:41:15,292
And I know her well.

1164
01:41:15,667 --> 01:41:18,501
Seeing my condition,
she will never go back to that man.

1165
01:41:19,251 --> 01:41:22,876
He might be rich,
but he can't buy her soul.

1166
01:41:24,001 --> 01:41:26,042
I control her strings.

1167
01:41:26,292 --> 01:41:28,292
And I will control her all my life.

1168
01:41:28,376 --> 01:41:30,042
Never let her go.

1169
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:32,792
Centuries of values
are imbibed in Vasudha.

1170
01:41:32,876 --> 01:41:34,167
She won't live in peace.

1171
01:41:34,292 --> 01:41:37,167
She will live in guilt that she
betrayed me for the rest of her life.

1172
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:40,626
She will pay for her
lust with her husband's blood.

1173
01:41:41,001 --> 01:41:43,542
I will never let
those two be together.

1174
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:49,376
That woman suffered for five years...

1175
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:52,292
...and now she'll live
on a false belief, that...

1176
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:54,876
...her husband sacrificed
himself for her.

1177
01:41:58,001 --> 01:42:01,667
You can help her if you want,
by proving Hari innocent.

1178
01:42:02,792 --> 01:42:06,792
Although Deshmukh sir would
never want this truth to be revealed.

1179
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:11,126
How?

1180
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:13,126
By going into the jungles of Bastar.

1181
01:42:14,251 --> 01:42:16,542
You will have to
meet Father Peter Dayal.

1182
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:20,417
If he gives a statement
in Hari's favor...

1183
01:42:21,126 --> 01:42:22,917
...then this case will be over.

1184
01:42:24,417 --> 01:42:26,001
And you'll have to do it soon.

1185
01:42:27,167 --> 01:42:30,251
Because the court has already
given Hari a death sentence.

1186
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:32,626
You have to take his confession...

1187
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:35,417
...because the court can
never deny his statement.

1188
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:43,251
Do me a favor,
cancel all my programs.

1189
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:46,501
Make arrangements
to go see Father Peter.

1190
01:42:49,292 --> 01:42:51,667
Take Vasudha's signatures on the plea.

1191
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:54,042
We'll have to appeal for
Hari in the higher court.

1192
01:43:01,251 --> 01:43:05,376
But I don't understand the reason
behind you going to that jungle.

1193
01:43:06,292 --> 01:43:09,376
This country's laws don't
work in those jungles, Aarav.

1194
01:43:10,001 --> 01:43:12,042
That place is rigged with explosives.

1195
01:43:12,167 --> 01:43:16,001
That entire place is goddamn
filled with land mines, Aarav.

1196
01:43:21,876 --> 01:43:23,126
I'm sorry.

1197
01:43:25,167 --> 01:43:27,292
I'm not going to let you go, man.

1198
01:43:29,251 --> 01:43:30,792
We'll find someone else for this job.

1199
01:43:30,876 --> 01:43:32,417
I'm sorry,
I'm not going to let you go.

1200
01:43:32,501 --> 01:43:34,626
Didn't you hear what Patil said?

1201
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,251
No one should find out about this.

1202
01:43:37,542 --> 01:43:39,001
I'll have to go personally.

1203
01:43:40,001 --> 01:43:41,501
And remember, Apoorva...

1204
01:43:41,542 --> 01:43:43,167
...I’ve to do this myself.

1205
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:46,251
I don't want anyone
else on this journey.

1206
01:43:47,042 --> 01:43:49,001
I cannot risk anyone's life.

1207
01:43:52,667 --> 01:43:54,376
Just make all the arrangements.

1208
01:44:00,542 --> 01:44:02,001
So finish it off.

1209
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:04,792
What's the point of going
the distance to commit suicide?

1210
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:06,542
Have you seen the newspapers today?

1211
01:44:07,001 --> 01:44:08,667
Our shares are falling, you know that.

1212
01:44:08,792 --> 01:44:11,417
And it also states that
you're supporting Hari...

1213
01:44:11,542 --> 01:44:14,001
...because you have an illicit
affair with his wife.

1214
01:44:14,042 --> 01:44:16,376
And that his kid
may actually be yours.

1215
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:19,626
I want you to file
a case against this paper.

1216
01:44:20,126 --> 01:44:22,376
I want this newspaper
to shut down permanently.

1217
01:44:22,417 --> 01:44:24,417
Who all are you going
to fight against, Aarav?

1218
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:27,001
Ministers...newspapers...me?

1219
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:29,917
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

1220
01:44:30,667 --> 01:44:33,917
And now you want to walk through
fire for the sake of your love.

1221
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:36,126
Why, Aarav? Why?

1222
01:44:47,792 --> 01:44:50,167
It took me a lifetime to understand...

1223
01:44:53,792 --> 01:45:00,292
...that we can only love someone,
when we stop loving ourselves.

1224
01:45:04,001 --> 01:45:11,042
Life is not like a business,
where it's just give and take.

1225
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:14,542
I just want to give now.

1226
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:18,167
So don't fight with me please.

1227
01:45:20,626 --> 01:45:22,376
And make arrangements for my journey.

1228
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:25,126
On one condition.

1229
01:45:26,876 --> 01:45:28,542
I'm coming with you too.

1230
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:31,626
Even I have the right to give love.

1231
01:45:32,542 --> 01:45:34,126
I'm coming with you.

1232
01:45:41,667 --> 01:45:43,042
Make sure all the stuff is over there.

1233
01:45:43,167 --> 01:45:44,126
Yes, sir.

1234
01:45:45,042 --> 01:45:47,001
Sir, all the arrangements
have been made.

1235
01:45:47,042 --> 01:45:48,376
All of it?
- Yes, sir.

1236
01:45:48,417 --> 01:45:50,292
I'll follow it up.
- Yeah. - Okay.

1237
01:45:55,126 --> 01:45:56,626
Aarav, I'll see you in the car.

1238
01:45:56,667 --> 01:45:58,292
Yeah.
- Okay sir.

1239
01:45:59,292 --> 01:46:00,667
Everyone, please.

1240
01:46:14,626 --> 01:46:16,376
What are you doing?

1241
01:46:29,792 --> 01:46:31,042
I had heard...

1242
01:46:33,167 --> 01:46:36,376
...that God comes to earth
in human form...

1243
01:46:37,917 --> 01:46:39,667
...to help someone.

1244
01:46:44,292 --> 01:46:45,792
I've seen it today.

1245
01:46:53,167 --> 01:46:54,376
Thank you.

1246
01:46:56,167 --> 01:46:58,042
I should be thanking you.

1247
01:47:00,792 --> 01:47:02,917
I was a shattered man...

1248
01:47:04,417 --> 01:47:07,251
...who was trying to
complete myself with money.

1249
01:47:09,792 --> 01:47:11,542
Then you entered my life...

1250
01:47:13,292 --> 01:47:14,667
...and made me whole again.

1251
01:47:22,042 --> 01:47:23,917
I had many addresses...

1252
01:47:25,876 --> 01:47:27,417
...but not a home.

1253
01:47:29,917 --> 01:47:32,917
You gave me a home...
in your heart.

1254
01:47:36,126 --> 01:47:41,542
Thank you for giving this wandering
traveler a refuge in your heart.

1255
01:47:59,626 --> 01:48:01,417
Can I take a picture of you?

1256
01:49:54,126 --> 01:49:55,626
- Listen, do you know him?

1257
01:49:55,876 --> 01:49:57,001
- Father Peter Dayal.

1258
01:49:57,126 --> 01:49:58,042
That's him.

1259
01:50:02,917 --> 01:50:05,167
- My name is Peter Dayal.

1260
01:50:05,501 --> 01:50:09,376
I declare that
Mr. Hari Prasad is an innocent man.

1261
01:50:09,417 --> 01:50:10,917
- Well done, Aarav.

1262
01:50:11,001 --> 01:50:14,126
- With this confessional video, we
can easily put a stay on the sentence.

1263
01:50:14,417 --> 01:50:16,042
He'll be out of jail soon.

1264
01:50:16,126 --> 01:50:18,001
He'll be a free man soon, Aarav.

1265
01:50:18,126 --> 01:50:20,001
Send it to me right away.
- Yes.

1266
01:50:20,501 --> 01:50:24,126
- The entire village
will bear witness to this.

1267
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:28,167
Aarav, send it.

1268
01:50:47,542 --> 01:50:49,626
- I just don't get you, Aarav.

1269
01:50:49,917 --> 01:50:54,917
What you did today will set Hari free.

1270
01:50:56,042 --> 01:50:58,542
And you will lose
Vasudha forever.

1271
01:50:58,876 --> 01:51:00,626
But you're still happy.

1272
01:51:02,001 --> 01:51:04,917
A true love story has no end, Apoorva.

1273
01:51:07,126 --> 01:51:09,292
There's a voice in
my heart which says that...

1274
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:14,542
...even the entire universe
cannot separate us.

1275
01:51:16,792 --> 01:51:18,042
We're meant to be together.

1276
01:51:19,292 --> 01:51:20,292
Just watch...

1277
01:51:21,542 --> 01:51:23,917
...one day we'll be together again.

1278
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:32,792
I don't get you, man.

1279
01:51:35,251 --> 01:51:38,001
Apoorva...stop the car.

1280
01:51:38,542 --> 01:51:40,376
What happened?
- Stop the car please.

1281
01:51:40,667 --> 01:51:42,292
What happened?

1282
01:51:43,917 --> 01:51:45,167
That fragrance.

1283
01:53:28,542 --> 01:53:31,126
We'll be there in...
2 hours from now.

1284
01:53:32,917 --> 01:53:34,292
Yeah, I'll call you back.

1285
01:53:46,751 --> 01:53:49,417
Aarav!

1286
01:54:48,667 --> 01:54:49,917
- Vasudha!

1287
01:54:50,042 --> 01:54:52,626
- Vasudha... Aarav!

1288
01:54:52,917 --> 01:54:54,751
- There's been an incident!

1289
01:55:05,417 --> 01:55:07,792
Vasudha, Aarav's no more.

1290
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:42,542
I knew Aarav.

1291
01:55:42,667 --> 01:55:45,292
He would've wanted
this crowd to live for Ruparel...

1292
01:55:45,376 --> 01:55:48,917
...and our focus to return to our
work, which he loved so much.

1293
01:55:49,167 --> 01:55:52,042
With that spirit, we want to get
the entire company together..

1294
01:55:52,126 --> 01:55:54,292
...to celebrate his extraordinary life.

1295
01:55:54,417 --> 01:55:56,542
And his various accomplishments.

1296
01:55:56,667 --> 01:55:59,542
He tried to break an eternal bond.

1297
01:56:00,792 --> 01:56:02,917
It's good that he's dead.

1298
01:56:04,542 --> 01:56:06,417
God exists, Patil sir.

1299
01:56:07,042 --> 01:56:08,417
He exists.

1300
01:56:08,917 --> 01:56:10,667
No, Hari.

1301
01:56:12,292 --> 01:56:15,542
A God that makes true love lose...

1302
01:56:16,167 --> 01:56:21,167
...ties a pious woman
to a fraud like you forever...

1303
01:56:21,792 --> 01:56:23,792
...makes her your prisoner...

1304
01:56:25,542 --> 01:56:28,042
...only you can believe in such a God.

1305
01:56:28,792 --> 01:56:35,251
Because the God I believe
in will punish you.

1306
01:56:37,751 --> 01:56:40,042
He will free Vasudha
from your clutches.

1307
01:56:42,792 --> 01:56:43,667
Now go...

1308
01:56:45,167 --> 01:56:47,876
...your empty house is waiting for you.

1309
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,501
- Vasudha!

1310
01:56:55,167 --> 01:56:56,126
Vasudha!

1311
01:57:04,042 --> 01:57:04,917
You?

1312
01:57:06,542 --> 01:57:08,042
Where's Vasudha?

1313
01:57:08,542 --> 01:57:09,792
Gone.

1314
01:57:10,417 --> 01:57:11,667
She left.

1315
01:57:12,167 --> 01:57:16,292
She's gone and left something for you.

1316
01:57:17,667 --> 01:57:19,001
Go, take a look.

1317
01:57:20,376 --> 01:57:21,292
Look!

1318
01:57:32,542 --> 01:57:35,501
- "I was shocked to see
that nuptial necklace."

1319
01:57:36,667 --> 01:57:40,792
- "I couldn't understand how
the meek woman I had branded..."

1320
01:57:41,626 --> 01:57:45,792
- "...with my name,
could actually leave me."

1321
01:57:45,876 --> 01:57:48,001
- "How did she muster such courage?"

1322
01:57:49,042 --> 01:57:51,667
- "This thought drove me crazy."

1323
01:57:53,501 --> 01:57:56,792
- "And just like a parched
man sets out to look for a well..."

1324
01:57:56,876 --> 01:57:58,667
- set out to find her."

1325
01:58:00,417 --> 01:58:03,292
- "And after 2 years of searching..."

1326
01:58:03,417 --> 01:58:07,001
- found her on the streets of
Kolkata during the Durga Festival..."

1327
01:58:07,042 --> 01:58:10,292
Glory to... Goddess Durga!

1328
01:59:09,417 --> 01:59:10,667
Saanj.

1329
01:59:13,376 --> 01:59:15,251
This is your father.

1330
01:59:16,042 --> 01:59:17,542
He's come to meet us.

1331
01:59:17,626 --> 01:59:20,126
Take his blessings and go out.

1332
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:25,001
We need to talk in private.

1333
01:59:32,376 --> 01:59:34,042
Saanj...

1334
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:35,251
Go out.

1335
01:59:57,251 --> 01:59:59,792
Stop this charade.
That's enough.

1336
02:00:01,917 --> 02:00:03,042
Remember this?

1337
02:00:03,417 --> 02:00:05,501
Or did you forget it like your past?

1338
02:00:05,667 --> 02:00:07,042
Remember?

1339
02:00:07,792 --> 02:00:08,667
Yes...

1340
02:00:11,126 --> 02:00:12,667
I've forgotten all about it.

1341
02:00:12,917 --> 02:00:14,917
Why did you bring it along?

1342
02:00:16,292 --> 02:00:17,667
To tie me?

1343
02:00:18,292 --> 02:00:19,917
How will you tie me, Hari?

1344
02:00:20,417 --> 02:00:22,042
With rituals and traditions?

1345
02:00:22,126 --> 02:00:23,626
Values?

1346
02:00:24,417 --> 02:00:29,292
Or with the charade
of your fake sacrifice?

1347
02:00:30,126 --> 02:00:34,292
No, Hari.
These things can't tie me down now.

1348
02:00:35,376 --> 02:00:37,292
And how will you forget this?

1349
02:00:37,501 --> 02:00:40,376
You can hide it under your sleeve,
but how will you forget it?

1350
02:00:40,917 --> 02:00:42,042
How?

1351
02:00:42,167 --> 02:00:43,667
This body is mine!

1352
02:00:44,042 --> 02:00:45,417
This breath is mine!

1353
02:00:45,667 --> 02:00:47,917
You're mine for generations to come.

1354
02:00:48,126 --> 02:00:52,417
You think you can change that
after sleeping with someone else?

1355
02:00:52,542 --> 02:00:54,042
You're my Vasudha.

1356
02:00:54,251 --> 02:00:55,876
You're my Vasudha!

1357
02:00:57,417 --> 02:00:59,292
He touched you, didn't he?

1358
02:00:59,667 --> 02:01:01,292
Where? Where did he touch you?

1359
02:01:01,417 --> 02:01:02,917
Did he touch you here?

1360
02:01:03,667 --> 02:01:05,042
Did you enjoy it?

1361
02:01:05,667 --> 02:01:07,042
You had fun, didn't you?

1362
02:01:10,792 --> 02:01:13,376
So you've shown your true colors.

1363
02:01:14,667 --> 02:01:16,542
Revealed who you truly are.

1364
02:01:25,417 --> 02:01:26,376
Wear this.

1365
02:01:26,667 --> 02:01:28,501
Wear this or I will kill you!

1366
02:01:28,876 --> 02:01:29,917
Kill me.

1367
02:01:30,292 --> 02:01:35,542
That's what men like
you have done to women like me.

1368
02:01:35,917 --> 02:01:37,917
You either killed us in the womb...

1369
02:01:38,292 --> 02:01:40,042
...or right after birth.

1370
02:01:40,126 --> 02:01:42,626
What strange tradition is this?

1371
02:01:42,917 --> 02:01:44,626
Everything belongs to you.

1372
02:01:44,667 --> 02:01:46,876
I've to wear your
vermillion on my forehead.

1373
02:01:47,042 --> 02:01:49,417
Your nuptial necklace around my neck.

1374
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:52,292
My wrists and your bangles.

1375
02:01:52,667 --> 02:01:57,417
My womb, my blood...

1376
02:01:57,542 --> 02:01:59,042
...my milk...

1377
02:01:59,417 --> 02:02:02,417
...and the child takes your name.

1378
02:02:03,126 --> 02:02:04,917
Everything is yours.

1379
02:02:06,042 --> 02:02:12,292
So what do you have that's mine.

1380
02:02:12,917 --> 02:02:13,667
Wait...

1381
02:02:13,751 --> 02:02:15,667
You're talking too much.

1382
02:02:16,376 --> 02:02:17,626
I will kill you.

1383
02:02:17,667 --> 02:02:19,167
I will kill you, Vasudha.

1384
02:02:19,417 --> 02:02:21,792
Kill me, Hari. Kill me.

1385
02:02:22,167 --> 02:02:24,917
Because I'm speaking out after ages.

1386
02:02:25,542 --> 02:02:26,917
I can't stop now.

1387
02:02:27,376 --> 02:02:28,626
Silence me.

1388
02:02:28,792 --> 02:02:34,292
Because I can no longer
live caged by your dead customs.

1389
02:02:35,167 --> 02:02:37,667
Have you seen the light of love?

1390
02:02:38,917 --> 02:02:40,917
I did, Hari.

1391
02:02:42,667 --> 02:02:45,917
When Aarav touched my soul.

1392
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:51,292
That light...gave rise
to a new feeling inside me.

1393
02:02:53,042 --> 02:02:56,042
Maybe that's why he came into my life.

1394
02:02:58,042 --> 02:03:02,501
All of us enter each
other's lives for a reason.

1395
02:03:04,376 --> 02:03:08,042
You came in my life
to take me to my love.

1396
02:03:08,042 --> 02:03:11,126
Goddess has sent you...
to set me free.

1397
02:03:11,167 --> 02:03:13,542
Cut this body. Set it on fire.

1398
02:03:15,042 --> 02:03:19,542
And take my ashes...to him.
- No.

1399
02:03:20,001 --> 02:03:21,792
He's waiting, Hari.

1400
02:03:23,417 --> 02:03:26,917
You've come here
to take me to my love.

1401
02:03:27,001 --> 02:03:29,292
You will take me to my love.

1402
02:03:29,417 --> 02:03:31,417
Hari, kill me!

1403
02:03:31,542 --> 02:03:32,792
Hari, kill me!

1404
02:03:34,917 --> 02:03:36,126
Hari, kill me!

1405
02:03:36,376 --> 02:03:37,917
Hari, he's waiting for me.

1406
02:03:38,042 --> 02:03:39,542
Hari, kill me!

1407
02:03:39,667 --> 02:03:41,251
Hari...
- You can't leave me!

1408
02:03:41,292 --> 02:03:42,417
Hari, kill me!

1409
02:03:42,542 --> 02:03:44,792
You will come back to me.
- Hari, he's waiting for me.

1410
02:03:44,876 --> 02:03:47,292
You'll be mine again!

1411
02:03:47,417 --> 02:03:49,417
You will come back to me.

1412
02:03:52,042 --> 02:03:55,251
- "I spent 21 years
living with this lie."

1413
02:03:55,501 --> 02:03:57,042
- "But Vasudha never returned."

1414
02:03:58,042 --> 02:04:02,626
- "And when her final time arrived
she set out to meet her Krishna."

1415
02:04:03,251 --> 02:04:05,417
- "But she couldn't reach him."

1416
02:04:10,376 --> 02:04:14,167
- "I am going to complete
