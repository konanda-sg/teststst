1
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>"Let's go."</i>

2
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:09,542
This new lad is a magician.

3
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,000
Then make sure you tip him well.

4
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,875
-One bite, please.
-No.

5
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,334
-Just one bite.
-No.

6
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:24,209
-Zoom-zoom, here comes the plane.
-No!

7
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:43,459
<i>"The one I lived for"</i>

8
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:48,084
<i>"The one I was ready to die for"</i>

9
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:52,584
<i>"The one I lived for..."</i>

10
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:53,834
Wear this before you leave.

11
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,625
-Come on. Go run!
-No.

12
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:58,375
You can go to play only
after you wear your jacket.

13
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,750
I said wear the jacket.

14
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:02,125
Hey! Varun, stop.

15
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,667
Please make sure he wears it.

16
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,375
Come here.

17
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,625
Want one?

18
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,292
What is your name?

19
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,750
Bal Premi.

20
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,167
Who named you that?

21
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,584
Dhamaal Premi.

22
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,542
How much should I pay?

23
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,125
Oh, here's the bill.

24
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,625
That settles the bill.

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,959
And this... is for you.

26
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,417
Make sure you buy yourself
a pair of gloves and a muffler.

27
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:56,334
For the winters.

28
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,959
I think you should find
a better name for yourself.

29
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,959
Bal Premi.

30
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,000
Keep a name that you like.

31
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,042
Okay?

32
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:13,875
Bye.

33
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,250
Give it back.

34
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,334
Families get 15% discount.

35
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,625
Give the money back to her, Chotu.
I'll buy them for you.

36
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,542
Let's go!

37
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,459
Coming!

38
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,667
Premi uncle.

39
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:46,084
Why do families get 15% discount?

40
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,667
Don't know. Neither do I have
a family nor did I make this scheme.

41
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,000
Everyone offers a discount
so I too continued with the trend.

42
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,750
What's so special
about families anyway?

43
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,125
Family is everything, Chotu.

44
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:02,209
If you have a family,
you have love, you have the world.

45
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:06,292
We don't have a family,
so we have nothing to worry about.

46
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,917
Get back to work.

47
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,792
Enough of this nonsense.
Get back to work now.

48
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,750
A FEW YEARS LATER

49
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,250
Hey, what are you up to?

50
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,375
Rabaan.

51
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,875
-What's going on?
-Sir, sorry.

52
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,834
They are not mine.
A guest had ordered them.

53
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:08,917
So?

54
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:10,375
Are you a waiter?

55
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,959
Who made the guest list for today?

56
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,584
This looks more like a birthday
party than my app's launch party.

57
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,709
What the hell is going on?

58
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,500
Sir...

59
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,000
Where's the event coordinator?

60
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,959
Why is the media still not here?
What is going on? Is this a joke?

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,375
-What is going on, huh?
-I'll check, sir.

62
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,292
-Do that.
-Okay, sir.

63
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,417
This way.

64
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:29,750
Sorry, sir.

65
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:43,584
Hi.

66
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,667
Hi.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,709
This event is crazy.

68
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,625
Feels more like a wedding.

69
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,084
Everyone's sloshed.

70
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,834
I know.

71
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,875
But listen,
this VR thing is too good.

72
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,584
It's... it's supercool.

73
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,084
Thank you.

74
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,250
Why didn't you come, dude?

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,292
I am so bored by myself.

76
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,292
Yes, you can still come.
The launch is yet to begin.

77
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:11,375
You know they have arranged
for an amazing magic show.

78
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,167
But the magician is missing.

79
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,959
Listen, I'll call you back, yeah?

80
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,042
Hello?

81
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,250
Excuse me? Hello?

82
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,250
You know everyone's
been looking for you?

83
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,625
Me?

84
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,875
You are here to perform
a magic show, right?

85
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,959
Go inside!

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,084
They have been looking for you.

87
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,334
-No, I--
-Listen.

88
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,917
Can you please teach me
a trick before you leave?

89
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:40,418
Anything, you know.

90
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,500
The handkerchief trick...
no, not the handkerchief trick.

91
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:43,584
Anything.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,042
Come on, come on, come on.

93
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,042
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah? Okay.

94
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,209
What's your name?

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Goga the great magician.

96
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:53,459
Goga the great magician?

97
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:56,752
Ready?

98
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,292
Oh, yeah, magic trick.

99
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,375
Yeah.

100
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,376
Okay.

101
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,250
Close your eyes.

102
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:06,834
Okay.

103
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,500
Take a deep breath.

104
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:12,709
Deeper.

105
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,125
Now hold it.

106
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,959
How long?

107
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:25,584
Excuse me?
How rude.

108
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,959
I mean what was that?

109
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,959
No, I... I am sorry.

110
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,626
-Was that your magic trick?
-No, no, no.

111
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,376
Actually, I am not a magician.

112
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,125
My name is Dhruv Shikhar.

113
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,667
The VR app launch
you are here to attend,

114
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,084
well, that app belongs to me.

115
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,209
Shit.

116
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,375
I am so sorry.

117
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,750
I'm... I'm really sorry.

118
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:47,959
Actually, your clothes...

119
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,084
I mean...

120
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:52,167
But listen, I have to tell you,
I tried this VR thing.

121
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,959
It is so amazing.

122
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:58,209
I mean I visited the Taj Mahal
while standing right there.

123
00:07:58,709 --> 00:07:59,709
Thank you.

124
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,125
Listen, can I just
ask you something?

125
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:03,334
Please have a seat.

126
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,959
Tell me something,

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,959
Can I see my parents wedding
just like I saw the Taj Mahal?

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,250
Like, you know if I give you like
some pictures or tapes or something?

129
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:16,917
-It is possible?
-Maybe.

130
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,750
It's possible?

131
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,167
Yeah, we can try.

132
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,875
Wow.

133
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,459
I am so sorry.

134
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,042
Hi, I am Anya Mehra.

135
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm a freelance blogger.

136
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,167
I came here to cover your event.

137
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,542
And luckily,
I bumped into you out here.

138
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,459
So, can we do this now?

139
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:35,959
-Quickly?
-No.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,959
Our marketing team
will give you the PR kit.

141
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,959
-It has everything you need to know.
-Everyone will get the same stuff.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,167
-Come on, 30 minutes?
-No, no, no. I am sorry.

143
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,084
-I won't take time. I promise.
-I don't want to do this.

144
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:45,250
-Come on--
-I said I don't want to do this.

145
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,209
Can I please sit here in peace,
for just five minutes?

146
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:50,959
Of course.

147
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,667
-I didn't--
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

148
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,626
-I didn't mean it like that.
-Sorry I asked. Sorry.

149
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,750
-I didn't mean it--
-Sorry.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,292
Damn it.

151
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,875
Goga.

152
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,000
It was my distant aunt's
not-so-distant nephew's wedding,

153
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,542
but it ended up
making a mess in my life.

154
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,042
My house looks like a battlefield
since the past one month.

155
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,292
And who is caught in the middle
of the crossfire? This poor guy.

156
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,125
Bloody hell.

157
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,959
Two choices, Shunty. You either
leave your family for good.

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,542
Or catch a train and leave town.

159
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,167
Stop bugging me.

160
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:40,917
-Dhruvi?
-What?

161
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,959
Let's go for a drive, yeah?

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,834
Speed through Sector 8,

163
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,167
and relive our good
old college days?

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
Let's go to the railway crossing,

165
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,000
and solve your problem
once and for all first.

166
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,959
Now you are crossing both
the limit and the speed limit.

167
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,750
Time for you
to buy me ice cream.

168
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,625
I want a chocolate and a vanilla--

169
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,542
Does he have tutti-frutti flavour?

170
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,334
I don't think so.

171
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,709
I'll have a mango ice cream then.

172
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,834
Cassata ice cream, please.
The disc.

173
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,417
-Don't order any for me.
-I won't.

174
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,292
Do you have tutti-frutti?
He doesn't have it.

175
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,375
Cassata?

176
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:12,667
Anya Mehra.

177
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:14,709
Hi.

178
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:16,084
Hi.

179
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,375
Goga the great magician

180
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,459
Oh, so you are the grumpy--

181
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,459
I mean the one with
a different personality.

182
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,334
No! You are spot on.

183
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,959
He's a grouch.

184
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:31,667
He just finished planning
my go-went-gone event.

185
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,167
-Excuse me?
-No, no.

186
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:36,000
Family... family planning.

187
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:36,667
I see.

188
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,292
His family's insisting
that he plan a baby.

189
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,375
He said, "I'd rather die
than have babies."

190
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,000
So I was trying to
talk some sense into him.

191
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,084
Baby will only...

192
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,750
Babies are a gift from God.

193
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,542
They will teach you to smile.
Right?

194
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,292
Teach you to forgive others.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,084
Anyone can make a mistake.

196
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,250
Sorry.

197
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,042
Anyone can make a mistake.

198
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,417
Just apologise.
It's not a big deal.

199
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,750
But... no!

200
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,959
He insists on jumping
in front of a train.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,084
-That is so wrong.
-Don't even think about it.

202
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,292
No, auntie! Never!

203
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,917
Don't take it seriously.

204
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,292
It is a serious matter.

205
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,334
I am Dr. Sanjeev Mehra.

206
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,500
You should visit my clinic
with your wife.

207
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,250
I will counsel both of you. Okay?

208
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,375
What is your name?

209
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:18,959
-Shunty.
-Sandeep.

210
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,875
-Don't offer your pet name.
-Sandeep.

211
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,209
We should get going.

212
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,250
We need to go there and have
the conversation we didn't have.

213
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,334
But my cassata?

214
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,959
-Later.
-Fine. Ta-ta.

215
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:30,750
-Bye.
-Bye.

216
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,917
-Don't take any drastic step--
-Dad, please, stop it.

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,959
-Stop it.
-Come on!

218
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,834
He's not as grumpy as
you had made him up to be.

219
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:39,917
-Right.
-He's cute.

220
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,125
He's very cute.

221
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:45,709
So?

222
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:47,834
What's brewing, Mr. Happy Emoji?

223
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,959
Nothing.

224
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,292
Nothing, huh?

225
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,625
<i>You know what my zero-to-one-million
journey has taught me?</i>

226
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,584
<i>That if you haven't been
to Agra with your family</i>

227
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,042
<i>and touched the pillars
of the Taj Mahal...</i>

228
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:14,625
<i>if you haven't done river rafting
with them in Rishikesh,</i>

229
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,542
<i>or if you haven't
held each other's hands</i>

230
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,000
<i>and climbed the snow-clad
mountains of Manali...</i>

231
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:22,042
<i>if you haven't watched a classic movie
together and got emotional...</i>

232
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,125
<i>then you are not living
your life to the fullest.</i>

233
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:29,417
<i>I mean, life is meant
to be beautiful and not boring.</i>

234
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:34,375
<i>It is your small stories that
keep making our journey beautiful.</i>

235
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,209
<i>So keep sharing.</i>

236
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,375
<i>Chotu, my boy.</i>

237
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,258
MY FAMILY
UNCLE

238
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,584
You cannot choose your family.

239
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,959
You either have one or you don't.

240
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,125
And you don't have one.
That's your fate.

241
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,042
But I want a family.

242
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,417
SUPER COMMANDO DHRUV
BAL PREMI

243
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,292
Stop it, Dad.

244
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,667
What is this?

245
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,542
Wrong question.
Not what, who is this.

246
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,959
Who is this?

247
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,334
A boy I presume?

248
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,167
Very funny.
Who is he?

249
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,667
Funny people are always
very good at heart.

250
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,334
-What is his name?
-Sanket.

251
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,000
Sanket.
Sanket Ahuja.

252
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,459
He belongs to a nice family.

253
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,167
He's... what's it called,
ah, yes, an investment banker.

254
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,210
Good for him.

255
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,834
You can't expect me to scan
through marriage proposals

256
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,000
when I am getting ready for work.

257
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,750
-Hello?
-You just need to glance through it.

258
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,334
-I'll handle the rest.
-Hey, Neeta!

259
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,000
Just yesterday he said it's been
a while since you came over.

260
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:48,209
No, seriously.

261
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,292
Here, talk to him.

262
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,042
Hi, auntie.
How are you?

263
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,500
Dad wanted to discuss something
very important with you.

264
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,667
Now you'll know how it feels

265
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,167
when someone burdens you with unwanted
things first thing in the morning.

266
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,459
Bye.

267
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:02,584
Hang on a second.

268
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,709
Hold on.

269
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,834
Will you meet him?

270
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,917
Yes, I will.

271
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,001
-Promise?
-I promise.

272
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:08,752
I won't!

273
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,042
Pull over, please.

274
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:32,417
"Mercury, Venus,"

275
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:36,709
"Earth..."
Good morning, madam!

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,334
Goga the great magician?

277
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,000
What is this? Another magic trick?

278
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,625
Social service?

279
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,250
No, just...

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,084
-Hi.
-Hi.

281
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,334
That's all for today, kids.

282
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,750
Memorise it for the next class.

283
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,292
-Okay, sir.
-Go, scram.

284
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,667
-Be here on time, Jashan.
-Okay, sir.

285
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,167
I teach them on the weekends.

286
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:07,875
Nice.

287
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,377
You...

288
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,709
What are you doing here?

289
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,126
I came here seeking admission.

290
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,667
Admission?

291
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,625
Oh. I see.

292
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:21,834
Of course.

293
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,750
You are not as grumpy
as you pretend to be.

294
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,959
Listen, I'm... I'm really sorry
about that night.

295
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,167
It's okay.

296
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,000
I was under pressure, so...

297
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:34,125
Really, it's okay.

298
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,042
Thank you.

299
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,250
Can I drop you somewhere?

300
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,792
No, I mean I was leaving, so...

301
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,875
On your scooter?

302
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,334
You move quite fast.

303
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,792
<i>"I am going crazy"</i>

304
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,292
<i>"I am falling in love"</i>

305
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,209
<i>"I am going crazy"</i>

306
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:14,167
<i>"I am falling in love"</i>

307
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,584
<i>"I am going crazy"</i>

308
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:20,250
<i>"I am falling in love"</i>

309
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:27,959
<i>"The level at which
Our souls connect"</i>

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,084
<i>"I cannot put it in words"</i>

311
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,250
<i>"I cannot let go of what we share"</i>

312
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,250
<i>"I can let go
Of this world instead"</i>

313
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,667
<i>"I am going crazy"</i>

314
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,584
<i>"I am falling in love"</i>

315
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,167
<i>"I am going crazy"</i>

316
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,584
<i>"I am falling in love"</i>

317
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,167
<i>"I am falling in love"</i>

318
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,292
And now you are
a part of this family.

319
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,042
Sweet.

320
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,250
You've got a lot of fascination
with families.

321
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,334
Fascination?

322
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,042
It's an obsession!

323
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,084
In fact, I have decided

324
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:15,250
I'd only marry a guy who has
a sweet family and a cute dog.

325
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,000
I just love dogs.

326
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,000
Sweet.

327
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,750
I don't know why I never asked you.

328
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,334
Who do you have in your family?

329
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,417
No one.

330
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,750
No one?

331
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,709
-No one.
-I mean, there has to be someone.

332
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,292
I mean
no one is here at the moment.

333
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,125
They are travelling, my parents.

334
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:34,209
Where?

335
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,167
Where?

336
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,959
You don't know
where your parents are?

337
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:39,918
No!

338
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,417
I mean they travel a lot, so...
They love traveling.

339
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,917
Wow.

340
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,000
They were in Ladakh
last when I spoke to them.

341
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:48,417
They were planning
a road trip from there.

342
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,793
Nice.

343
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:50,917
Yeah.

344
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:56,000
By the way, I love dogs too.

345
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,125
In fact,
I am thinking about adopting one.

346
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,667
When?

347
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:02,250
Whenever you say.

348
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,250
I mean, in case you want to play...

349
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,959
<i>"There is but One God"</i>

350
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,917
<i>"His name is the Truth"</i>

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,709
<i>"He is the Creator"</i>

352
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,042
<i>"He fears none"</i>

353
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,750
<i>"He is without hate"</i>

00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,750
<i>"He never dies"</i>

355
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:26,417
<i>"He is beyond the cycle
Of birth and death"</i>

356
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,625
<i>"He is realised by the kindness
Of the True Guru"</i>

357
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:29,418

00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,959

00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,084
<i>"And has ever been True"</i>

361
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:39,625
<i>"Nanak says he is also True now"</i>

362
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,709
What's the occasion?

363
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,250
My parents' anniversary.

364
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,000
You should have told me.

365
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,375
We could have planned something.
We could have had a party.

366
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,417
Death anniversary.

367
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,750
So sorry.

368
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,959
It's okay.

369
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,834
But that day at the Sukhna Lake?

370
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,834
My father's brother and his wife.

371
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,250
I was seven years old.

372
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:17,584
We were staying in Delhi.

373
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,250
My parents were
going out for a movie.

374
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:26,834
I insisted that they take me along.

375
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,750
I even cried,
but they didn't give in.

376
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,000
Mom promised we'd go to
India Gate after they returned.

377
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:38,917
All together.
We'd have ice cream there.

378
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:44,667
They never returned.

379
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:50,167
Their theatre had caught fire.

380
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:01,167
Sometimes I wonder
what would have become of me

381
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,125
if they hadn't taken me in.

382
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,959
Anyways...

383
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,167
Anya?

384
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,292
I...

385
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,250
Stop giving me that look.
I hate it.

386
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,000
How about an ice-cream?

387
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,127
Chotu?

388
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,292
Chotu...

389
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,417
-Dhruv.
-Hmm?

390
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,125
Call me Dhruv.

391
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,834
Dhruv.

392
00:20:57,167 --> 00:21:03,000
Look, life is like a highway
where cars keep racing ahead.

393
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:06,750
You can stop some cars.

394
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,959
You can ask for a lift.

395
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,042
If there's no vacant seat, they'll
adjust and make some space for you.

396
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:18,167
But the cars with families in them
never stop.

397
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,834
They'll never give you a lift

398
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,709
even if they have a vacant seat.

399
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,000
What does this mean?

400
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,875
It means, if you don't have a family,
you make one for yourself.

401
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,250
-Make one for myself?
-Yes.

402
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:38,334
Study hard,
do well in life, marry a nice girl,

403
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,625
and have dozens of imps
just like you.

404
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,750
Happy birthday, Granny!

405
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,375
Her life is so similar
to mine, Shunty.

406
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,250
So?

407
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:01,000
So...

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,167
I like her.

409
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,959
I think she's the one.

410
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,000
Awesome.

411
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,042
You should always
express how you feel,

412
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,834
as soon as possible.

413
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,750
Of course. You are right.

414
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:25,959
One should do just that.

415
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,375
-So tell her.
-Of course, I should tell her.

416
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:30,959
Then tell her already!

417
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,917
Not now, not so late in the night.

418
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,875
So, you still know
what time of the day it is.

419
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,917
Then it's not love.

420
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,500
You are just passing time.

421
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:40,750
Don't doubt my love.

422
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:42,500
-I feel the love deep inside me.
-Oh, really?

423
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:45,167
Deep inside, huh? Then call her.
That works better.

424
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,959
Decent guys don't call up girls
this late in the night.

425
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,709
-Then let me call her. I'll do it.
-No, you won't.

426
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,000
-No, you won't.
-I'll call her.

427
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,500
-Who knows what you'll say.
-But I'll...

428
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,667
I'll...

429
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,209
You're calling her?
Go on, call her.

430
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,542
-Call her. Call her.
-Fine, I will.

431
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,792
Keep quiet.

432
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,042
Hello?

433
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,542
Hello? Hi, Anya.

434
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,209
Were you sleeping?

435
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,250
Yes, I have to get up early.

436
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,875
Listen, can we meet tomorrow?

437
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,084
Sure.

438
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,334
No, no, no.

439
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,584
I'm supposed to meet
a prospective groom's family,

440
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,250
so I need to stay home.

441
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:28,917
A prospective groom?

442
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,125
<i>Yes, Sanket.</i>

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,459
I didn't tell you about him?

444
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,293
No.

445
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:37,042
<i>Oh, sorry. I didn't.</i>

446
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,709
<i>So, his parents are coming over
to meet my parents.</i>

447
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,292
How about the day after tomorrow?

448
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,417
Fine. Okay. Bye.

449
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,250
Okay.
Good night.

450
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,209
Are you meeting her tomorrow?

451
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,959
Tell me!

452
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,042
She's meeting
a prospective groom tomorrow.

453
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:04,542
A prospective groom?

454
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:10,542
Get down, Chintu.
You'll ruin the sofa.

455
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,375
Chintu, you'll ruin the sofa.

456
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:14,875
Get down!

457
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:18,334
No, I won't!
This is so much fun, Mom!

458
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:21,000
This sofa is so bouncy.

459
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,334
Hey!

460
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,167
What is he doing?

461
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,667
He's jumping on the sofa
with his shoes on.

462
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,959
Idiot.
We are expecting guests.

463
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Are you a monkey?

464
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,334
I'll punch you.

465
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,334
Chintu! Is this the way
to talk to your uncle?

466
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,459
Apologise to him right away!

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,709
I don't want his fake apology.

468
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,084
Tell me something?

469
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:40,625
Who teaches you
to behave like this?

470
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,834
Your father?

471
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:43,875
Which father would do that,
brother?

472
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,542
What are you trying to imply?

473
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,042
Well, our father didn't teach us
to behave like that.

474
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,834
Did he teach you to punch anyone?

475
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,042
He certainly didn't teach me that.

476
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,209
Obviously, someone has
taught him to behave like this,

477
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,334
or he was born this way.

478
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,250
You two have started arguing again?

479
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:55,709
We have no reason to.

480
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,959
You know I don't even
like talking to them.

481
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
-Dad, please.
-Okay, brother, then I'll leave.

482
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,625
-I shouldn't have come here.
-No, no, no!

483
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,084
-Auntie, please!
-Hello, hello, hello.

484
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,250
Keep smiling, always.

485
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:06,584
-Okay?
-Our guests have arrived.

486
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,375
Fine.
Go and answer the door.

487
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,250
Bloody monkey!

488
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,167
Should I make her open it
or just leave it there?

489
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,917
Just go with the flow, bro.

490
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,500
-Dhruvi, I know you can do this.
-All the best.

491
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:17,459
Come on, brother.
All the best.

492
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,625
Hello, uncle!

493
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:20,625
Doctor!

494
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,959
-Doctor!
-Uncle!

495
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:24,334
Good morning, uncle!

496
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,542
We were looking for you.

497
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,834
-Right.
-Exactly.

498
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,625
What are you guys doing here?

499
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,084
-What are we doing here?
-Yes.

500
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:32,500
-We...
-Why are we here?

501
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:34,167
-He has a bad stomach ache.
-Oh, no!

502
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,459
We were passing by, so I thought
he should show it to a doctor.

503
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,167
Why has he placed his
hand on his chest then?

504
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,292
You have placed your
hand on your chest?

505
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,459
Oh, damn.

506
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,959
-He's suffering from gas.
-Oh, I see.

507
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,167
It's not solid, so it keeps
shifting from stech to chemach.

508
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,167
I mean from chest to stomach,
back and forth.

509
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,959
Yes.

510
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,750
No problem.
You are a strong boy.

511
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:52,834
Go to the clinic.

512
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,834
I'll instruct Rakesh
to give you an antacid.

513
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,167
-All gases will turn liquid with it.
-No!

514
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,459
Don't make him go
through it alone, uncle.

515
00:25:58,542 --> 00:25:59,959
He's an only child.

516
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,209
He's my only friend.

517
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:02,667
He will die alone.

518
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:03,959
Two minutes only.

519
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,542
I am expecting guests, so...

520
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:09,542
You'll let him die just
because you are expecting guests?

521
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:13,334
Don't doctors take an oath
to always save lives?

522
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,000
It's okay.
Shunty, let's go see another doctor.

523
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:16,334
-No! I want Dr. Mehra only.
-Okay! Fine! Wait.

524
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,000
I'll go with him.

525
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,209
-Come, son, let's operate upon you.
-You'll be fine, Shunty.

526
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,500
-Go! Go!
-Thank you, uncle.

527
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:24,292
-Come with me.
-Go! Go!

528
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,875
Doctors too have families,
you know?

529
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,667
I hope you won't take
undue advantage of the situation.

530
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,084
Just lie down flat.

531
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,167
Arms by your side.

532
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,959
A little lower.

533
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:44,792
A little lower.

534
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,834
Little bit more.

535
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:50,084
If it's hurting down there,
then it's definitely an STD.

536
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,292
100%.

537
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,209
But I have never done
anything wrong.

538
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,750
That's why you contracted it!

539
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:55,875
Oh.

540
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,375
How much time do I have left?

541
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,667
Just kidding.
You are absolutely fine!

542
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's just indigestion.

543
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What did you have for breakfast?

544
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,334
I had stuffed flatbreads.

545
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:04,834
But I don't mind a bread toast.

546
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,042
I asked because I can't give
you meds on an empty stomach.

547
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,167
This isn't a restaurant where
you can order bread toast.

548
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,292
Anya! Hurry up.

549
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,292
Yes. Coming!

550
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,167
Hey, sorry, bro.

551
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Okay.

552
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:06,917
Sanket?

553
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,959
Welcome, Mr. Ahuja.

554
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,334
Hello, Mrs. Ahuja.

555
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:11,917
There's my boy.

556
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,250
Very good. Very good.

557
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:15,084
Please come in.

558
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,542
I so want to punch his face.

559
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,125
I hope this isn't a mistake.

560
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,625
Trust your magic.

561
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,292
<i>Anya!</i>

562
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:26,000
Surprise.

563
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:29,584
No, I had not attended
your parents' wedding.

564
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:31,834
I am not that old.

565
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,542
But I hope you liked it.

566
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,667
Well, I...

567
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,334
I... love you...

568
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,459
Anya.

569
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,375
Will you marry me?

570
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Please?

571
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,625
Draw a house.

572
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,417
I want to hear what
you said in it again.

573
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:59,000
Sorry.

574
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,000
Did you adopt a dog?

575
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,167
Huh?

576
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,334
Did you adopt a dog?

577
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,125
What?

578
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,209
-Continue drawing that house.
-Sorry.

579
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,875
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

580
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,750
Okay.

581
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,167
Bring your parents over.

582
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,292
Let's square off the formalities
and start living our lives together.

583
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:43,875
Parents!

584
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:53,625
Continue drawing a house.

585
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,251
At least
someone should have their own.

586
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:56,542
What?

587
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,584
I know. She has asked me to bring
my parents over to her place.

588
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:04,292
Families are a messy business, bro.

589
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:06,542
Let's keep it simple.

590
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,000
You lied to her, right?

591
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:09,250
Now you just have
to tell her the truth.

592
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,584
It's not a big deal.

593
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:14,292
No, what if she doesn't get me?

594
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,084
What if she feels bad and leaves?

595
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,250
Why?

596
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,542
Too late.

597
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,875
No, Dhruvi.

598
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:23,167
I have already faced
too many rejections in life.

599
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,292
I won't survive her rejection.

600
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,000
Okay. So, if Anya wants a family,
I will give her one.

601
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,250
If she wants parents,
then I'll get them for her.

602
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:42,584
Shunty, Anya should witness her bright
future with me and not my sad past.

603
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,375
It will be handled.

604
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:47,500
It will be handled?
Don't try to pacify your heart, bro.

605
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:48,376
This...

606
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,750
You either have
a family or you don't.

607
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:51,917
I mean...

608
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,250
I've heard that before.

609
00:32:56,959 --> 00:33:00,000
Shunty, I am going to marry Anya.

610
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,834
We'll have a sweet family.

611
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,875
Bro, you are complicating
something that is quite simple.

612
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,292
Why does this have to travel
all over the place?

613
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,875
Why can't you just
place the snack in my hand?

614
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,292
I'll adopt a dog as well.

615
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,250
Do as you please.

616
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,959
Where are you taking me, Shunty?

617
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,125
I am telling you

618
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,584
he is the one-stop solution
for everything wedding related.

619
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,542
My pokey neighbour, Shaadiram.

620
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,209
-"Matchmaker"?
-Yes.

621
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,209
-This is the place?
-Yes.

622
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:32,334
Are you sure?

623
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,959
Don't you trust me, brother?

624
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,459
Shaadiram, aka Joginder Arora.

625
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:10,000
He's a blessing in disguise,
I tell you.

626
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:13,125
Shunty, my man.

627
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,750
Shaadiram, aka Joginder Arora.

628
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:16,959
Dhruv.

629
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,584
Dhruv.

630
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,417
How's your brother-in-law doing?

631
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:21,959
Good.

632
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,375
So,

633
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,667
I can provide you with
an orchestra, caterers, decorators,

634
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,625
any kind of priest, relatives like
an old grandmother, a widowed aunt,

635
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,750
a brother who always fights,
an alcoholic uncle,

636
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,084
an uncle who gets upset
over petty things,

637
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:39,459
the aunt who can cry
at the drop of a hat,

638
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,084
an uncle who loves
to pick fights,

639
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:42,625
a spinster aunt or the crazy one,

640
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:45,209
hot sister-in-law,
sexy sister-in-law,

641
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:51,459
lingerie, cutlery,
condoms, aphrodisiacs.

642
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,542
Basically, everything.
What do you want?

643
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,250
None of the above.

644
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,959
None of the above?
Then what do you desire, sir?

645
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,667
I've never fallen short of variety.

646
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,000
Shaadiram has the solution
for all your wedding needs.

647
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:06,750
Just name it.

648
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:11,167
I have customers coming here
from the US, Canada and London.

649
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,125
Want me to arrange
a bachelor party for you?

650
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:15,542
Or do you have a special requirement
for your bachelor party?

651
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,834
Something grand
or something naughty?

652
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:18,000
-We--
-Want parents.

653
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,084
Yes.

654
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,167
Parents?

655
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,750
Doesn't everyone have parents?

656
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,459
He doesn't.

657
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,167
Don't be disheartened.

658
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,334
I can arrange for parents as well.

659
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:42,625
Tell me which kind would you prefer?

660
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,084
Indian? African? Russian? Italian?

661
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:46,834
I am not here for a slab of marble.

662
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,250
I want parents.

663
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:54,584
Simple and genuine people to stay
at my place for a couple of months.

664
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:03,959
Yeah?

665
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:20,750
What if you met with an accident
or get run over by a bus,

666
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:24,084
get shot, burnt or get a high fever
after you take us home?

667
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:27,042
There are thousands
of options to die in India.

668
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:32,750
What happens to your
helpless parents if you die?

669
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,542
Myself Ghasitaram.

670
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,125
Ghantiwala.

671
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,667
Best. He's a part-time
insurance agent.

672
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,250
He will be a very good father.

673
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:45,084
His eyes, in fact
his eyebrows too reflect love.

674
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,917
He refused to recognise me
after just one stint in prison.

675
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:08,042
My daughter-in-law used
to torture me, so I strangled her.

676
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:10,917
Shaadiram!

677
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,667
He is a great guy.
Such noble thoughts.

678
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:14,959
Very nice.

679
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,584
I can be your father,

680
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:20,209
so stop worrying about it.

681
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,834
By the way,
what's the status on your mother?

682
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,959
-We are still looking.
-Yes.

683
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:29,500
To be a good father, I'll need
to know the mother intimately.

684
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:34,917
Only then will we be able
to be good parents.

685
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:41,959
So, I'll have to find a hot chick
and I'll make her a mother.

686
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,084
What the hell, Shaadiram?

687
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,417
-Dhruvi!
-He'll be my father?

688
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,917
-Listen, Dhruvi.
-Bro, bro...

689
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,209
-Hear me out, Dhruvi.
-What will you say, huh?

690
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,125
Bro, bro...
Hear me out.

691
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,125
-I am trying my best.
-This is you trying your best?

692
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:59,875
God alone manufactures
the genuine stuff in this case.

693
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,834
This is the first time
I have got such a requirement.

694
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:05,250
I assure you I'll soon have
a suitable piece for you.

695
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:07,084
You'll get the perfect replica
at my place.

696
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:10,042
I'd have already found what I wanted
had you paid more attention!

697
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:11,625
You don't deserve
to be called Matchmaker.

698
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,334
You should be known
as Doomsayer.

699
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,750
-I'll find my parents on my own.
-We'll try some more out.

700
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:18,542
Bro! Please wait!
I have a lot of variety.

701
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:22,000
I'll make you such a nice family,
that you keep coming back to me.

702
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:25,625
I didn't like that
you called me Doomsayer.

703
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,875
<i>"I set out to find my love"</i>

704
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,625
<i>"I couldn't find him"</i>

705
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:37,209
<i>"I set out to find my beloved"</i>

706
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:40,875
<i>"I couldn't find him"</i>

707
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:44,459
<i>"I set out to find my love"</i>

708
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:48,209
<i>"I couldn't find him"</i>

709
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,417
<i>I want to meet Premi uncle.</i>

710
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,084
Premi uncle?

711
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:28,334
Yes. Purshottam Mishra.

712
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,542
-Purshottam Mishra?
-Yes.

713
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,042
He's no more.

714
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:33,834
He's no more?

715
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,917
I mean he's no more
the owner of this restaurant.

716
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,042
It's been 10 years.
He sold everything and left.

717
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,000
Okay.
Where is he now?

718
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,584
I think I had his new address.
Let me check.

719
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:43,750
Please.

720
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,375
Here you go.

721
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,375
Thank you.

722
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:05,709
<i>5th March 1988, a romantic movie</i>

723
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,584
<i>was playing at a movie theatre
in the neighbourhood.</i>

724
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,292
<i>Deepti and I went to watch it.</i>

725
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,959
As soon as we came
out of the theatre,

726
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,375
her angry father grabbed my hand.

727
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:31,292
I told him
that I love his daughter.

728
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,084
I love her
from the bottom of my heart.

729
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:35,375
But he wouldn't budge.

730
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:44,000
Why is it so hard to find peace?

731
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,750
How can just one person
mean so much to anyone?

732
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:51,000
Premi uncle?

733
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,917
Dhruv.

734
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:07,959
Chotu.

735
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,293
<i>Super Commando Dhruv.</i>

736
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:16,084
So, you are still stuck
at having a family of your own?

737
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,584
He wants him to be his father?

738
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:20,959
You are the one who told me that
I should make a family of my own.

739
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,459
I didn't ask you
to make me your father.

740
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:29,875
Premi uncle, help me out.

741
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,167
Please.

742
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:35,042
Just like you helped me out, huh?

743
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:39,334
Remember, how you left
in the middle of the night?

744
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,084
I cannot help you.

745
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,334
Sorry.

746
00:41:49,084 --> 00:41:50,417
I was just a kid.

747
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,542
Let bygones be bygones.

748
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,084
It's a thing of the past.

749
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,125
Okay, I am sorry.
Sorry.

750
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,750
I just want you to pretend
to be my father.

751
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:06,584
I can be your father,
but you don't deserve to be my son.

752
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,459
You cannot fulfil my wish.

753
00:42:11,584 --> 00:42:15,000
You are just as selfish
as you were back then.

754
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,625
Dhruvi!

755
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,000
Congrats, brother.

756
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,875
You have a ready-made sister
as well.

757
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:21,959
Awesome.

758
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,334
Family complete.

759
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,375
Your daughter's very cute, uncle.
Ten on ten.

760
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,542
You little... Get lost!

761
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:38,500
He comes back after 20 years
only for his selfish motives.

762
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:41,959
-I am not stupid.
-Wait, wait, wait. Come here.

763
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You peed on the mattress
and left in the middle of the night.

764
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,959
She is not his daughter.

765
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:50,542
She is his first and only love.

766
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,042
Deepti Kashyap.

767
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,625
Her address.

768
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,000
Take him away from here.
Take him!

769
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:03,084
Go!

770
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:04,167
Go.

771
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,000
Deepti Kashyap.

772
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,375
What?

773
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,042
No! Dhruvi, what do you talk...

774
00:43:10,209 --> 00:43:12,000
We'll go meet Deepti
for that oldie's sake?

775
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:13,250
No way, man. I'm not going with you.
Are you crazy?

776
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:14,292
Come on, Shunty.

777
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,625
-What?
-What are you saying?

778
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:18,042
What if Deepti Kashyap
agrees to help?

779
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:20,125
-I'll be sorted.
-No!

780
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:22,709
I know Uncle Purshottam
since I was a little boy.

781
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:24,209
He knows Deepti Kashyap
since his college days.

782
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:25,875
You know me since so long.
We all know each other so well.

783
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:27,042
We won't face any problem.

784
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,375
-He won't be able to pull it off.
-I am getting a mother and a father.

785
00:43:29,459 --> 00:43:30,667
I say we should go for it.

786
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:32,959
I'll have Shaadiram
sort it out for you.

787
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,042
-To hell with Shaadiram.
-Come on, man.

788
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:38,959
Tara must have lodged a complaint
against me at the police station.

789
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:52,000
I understand your emotions, son.

790
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:56,417
But what you are doing
is utter stupidity.

791
00:43:58,042 --> 00:43:59,834
That poor girl...

792
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,292
What is her name?

793
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,750
Anya.

794
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:04,084
Anya.

795
00:44:04,334 --> 00:44:05,834
You are deceiving her.

796
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,459
I suggest you tell her
the truth right away.

797
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,709
Such dramas only break hearts.

798
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:22,959
I get what you are trying to say,
but there is a problem, so...

799
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,375
In any case,
I cannot be a part of this.

800
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,375
I mean I have a family of my own.

801
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,959
If my son hears about this...

802
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:34,292
Varun.

803
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,375
His name is Varun.

804
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:43,000
What will Varun think
about all this, huh?

805
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:45,792
His mother with
a complete stranger...

806
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:46,959
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

807
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,750
He isn't a complete stranger.
You know him.

808
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:49,917
Premi uncle.

809
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,625
Purshottam Mishra.

810
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,042
He still treasures
the picture he has of you.

811
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,292
We saw it.

812
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,084
-He'll be my father.
-Please...

813
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:05,375
Please leave.

814
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:08,167
What is it, Ms. Deepti?

815
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,917
Please leave.

816
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:43,250
I doubt we can convince her.

817
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:46,167
We have to try.

818
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:49,292
This bird won't be flying anywhere.

819
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,542
You should at least meet him once.

820
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,584
He has been waiting for you
all these years, you know.

821
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,292
He's staying at
the city's old-age home

822
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,293
with a hope that your paths
might cross one day.

823
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,084
I am so...

824
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,000
I am sorry, but some distances...

825
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,209
Some things are...

826
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:25,542
You won't get it.

827
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,875
Excuse me.

828
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:30,250
-He loves you.
-Enough!

829
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:31,917
Stop it!

830
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:33,667
Enough!

831
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,459
You two should leave.

832
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:37,375
We're done.

833
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:47,709
Shaadiram?

834
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,459
Sit.

835
00:46:51,084 --> 00:46:53,000
Mom is right.

836
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,375
I shouldn't get emotionally
attached to my friends.

837
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:20,667
Let me help you with that.

838
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:29,459
Auntie, do you remember visiting
a roadside eatery a few years ago?

839
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,709
You had once met
a little boy there.

840
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:33,375
Bal Premi?

841
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,959
You had asked him to pick
a nice name for himself.

842
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,292
A name that he likes.

843
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:44,000
You know he did pick
a nice name for himself.

844
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:46,917
Dhruv.

845
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:55,084
Do it for me
if not for Premi uncle.

846
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,417
You gave me a name, an identity.

847
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,334
I have managed to come
so far on my own.

848
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:02,750
Now I just want to have
a family of my own.

849
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:09,459
If you come with me as my mother,
then my family will be complete.

850
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:11,375
Please.

851
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,000
Ms. Deepti!

852
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:27,126
ANYA
CAN WE MEET TODAY?

853
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:28,001
WHERE ARE YOU?
WHY AREN'T YOU REPLYING? HELLO!?

854
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:28,958
DHRUV, PAPA SAID WE CAN MEET
YOUR FAMILY THIS FRIDAY.

855
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:35,917
Dhruv.

856
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:47,709
Come in.
I want to talk to you.

857
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,667
Okay.

858
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,459
Premi uncle?

859
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,042
Uncle?

860
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,625
Premi uncle, look who is here.

861
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:43,250
May I?

862
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,542
Purshottam?

863
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I have waited so long
for you to knock at my door.

864
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:09,167
You have fulfilled my wish.

865
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:20,459
Shall we get going now?

866
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:24,709
I am here to help you.

867
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:26,834
Yes.

868
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:30,334
We will pretend to be your parents.

869
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:31,959
Yes.

870
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,084
Nothing else.

871
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:34,542
Okay.

872
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:35,542
Got it?

873
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:37,459
Got it.

874
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:39,375
Got it?

875
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:41,209
Got it?

876
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:41,959
Got it?

877
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,084
He got it.

878
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,667
Got it.

879
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:53,250
We are your parents, so technically
we are husband and wife.

880
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:55,042
Get my bags.

881
00:50:58,626 --> 00:50:59,544
Baggage.

882
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:23,209
-Mishra. Deepti Mishra, not Kashyap.
-Mishra.

883
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:24,875
I hope there is no confusion.

884
00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:26,125
No confusion.

885
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:27,250
Deepti Mishra.

886
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,000
You are my five-star son.

887
00:51:30,084 --> 00:51:31,625
Wait a second.
Hello?

888
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:32,875
Shunty?

889
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:38,334
Bro, I wore my lucky shirt for you,
but they aren't letting me in.

890
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:40,459
Oh. Wait, I am coming.

891
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,459
You must come out
with immediate effect.

892
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:44,750
Okay. Shunty is here.
I'll go get him.

893
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,043
Wait here. I'll be right back.

894
00:51:46,084 --> 00:51:47,750
Take your time.

895
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,709
Don't worry. I am not going inside.

896
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,959
He had asked us to wait downstairs.

897
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,042
Yes.

898
00:51:57,709 --> 00:52:00,709
Dr. Sanjeev Mehra plus seven.

899
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:02,000
Sanjeev?

900
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:05,292
Is that them?

901
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,209
Wooden flooring.

902
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:23,084
-Dhruv?
-Purshottam.

903
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:25,750
Mr. Purshottam,
I am Dr. Sanjeev Mehra.

904
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:27,000
Welcome.

905
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:30,000
-Doctor?
-Yes.

906
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:32,959
I'm retired
Professor Purshottam Mishra.

907
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,625
Of course.
We have been waiting for you.

908
00:52:34,709 --> 00:52:35,501
Okay. Okay. Okay.

909
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:36,667
Hi.

910
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,750
God bless you.

911
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,292
Actually, she isn't Anya.

912
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:47,000
She is my wife, Rupa.

913
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:49,084
That's why I said, "God bless you."

914
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,125
For your daughter, I would've said,
"May God bless you with 8 children."

915
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,209
Eight children?
What are you saying? No, thank you.

916
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:55,709
Two are most than enough.

917
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,959
Focus on the emotions, Doc.

918
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:03,834
-Hi.
-My wife, Deepti Kashyap.

919
00:53:04,709 --> 00:53:05,627
"Mishra."

920
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,334
-Kashyap?
-Mishra?

921
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:10,167
Hello, uncle! Hi, auntie!

922
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,459
You too decided to tag along?

923
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:13,709
Anya's father.
He is a very good doctor.

924
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:14,709
A top doc.

925
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:17,042
I guess you have
already met my parents.

926
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:21,292
I am just a little confused.
Kashyap? Mishra?

927
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,667
Dhruv Shikhar?

928
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,292
My father doesn't believe
in the caste system.

929
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,001
Right.

930
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,875
I see.
It's not a surname.

931
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:30,084
Dhruv Shikhar
is my first name...

932
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:31,750
-Anya.
-Ananya.

933
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,334
-"Anya."
-Anya.

934
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:34,293
-Anya.
-Anya.

935
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:35,250
-Anya.
-Anya.

936
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:36,334
Hello, uncle.

937
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,917
-Hello, auntie.
-Mom, Anya.

938
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:44,375
She is so beautiful.

939
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:50,625
He would have been
so happy to meet her.

940
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:53,000
-He who?
-I am right here.

941
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:54,792
I am still here.
I haven't left as yet.

942
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:58,000
I had said that I wanted
to go to the washroom.

943
00:54:01,584 --> 00:54:03,000
God bless you.

944
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:04,584
Lead a happy life.

945
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,625
Thank you.

946
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,250
-Shall we go inside?
-Yes, let's go.

947
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,043
Let's go. Let's go.

948
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:17,626
-Please come.
-Check this one out, sir.

949
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:18,376
Okay.

950
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:19,459
Place your order, please.

951
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:27,709
We were surprised when she
asked us to meet Dhruv's parents.

952
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,375
Why didn't you meet
Dhruv's family then?

953
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:32,250
Excuse me?

954
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,542
Why didn't you meet
Dhruv's family any sooner?

955
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:37,959
It's not like you
need a visa to meet us.

956
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,167
Right.

957
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:40,625
Right?

958
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:42,959
How about some
steamed potato curry?

959
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,334
-They prepare it well.
-Sure, go ahead.

960
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,125
Don't forget to order a dessert.

961
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,834
Ma'am, you should order
for all of us.

962
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:51,042
No.
Dear, you order it.

963
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,459
-You should order.
-No, no.

964
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:54,750
I am not used to
Chandigarh food.

965
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:58,084
So, you... I mean, your parents
don't stay in Chandigarh?

966
00:54:58,167 --> 00:54:59,959
No, of course,
they stay in Chandigarh with me.

967
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:02,125
-They travel a lot.
-Doc, we travel a lot.

968
00:55:02,209 --> 00:55:05,209
-I told you they travel a lot.
-But we prefer home-cooked meals.

969
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:06,959
Go anywhere you want, but
always stick to home-cooked meals.

970
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:08,084
Very good. Everyone should eat
home-cooked meals.

971
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:10,625
I have cooked at
a roadside eatery for 20 years.

972
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,042
But aren't you a professor?
So, roadside eatery?

973
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,542
By roadside eatery
he means canteen.

974
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:19,750
Okay.

975
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,584
He prefers using
hardcore Hindi words.

976
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:24,500
He used to run the college canteen
for underprivileged children.

977
00:55:24,584 --> 00:55:26,417
-Amazing.
-How sweet.

978
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:27,293
He is very generous.

979
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:32,000
Doc, as a professor I have
always taught my students

980
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:35,834
that everyone has a right
to choose their life partner,

981
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:38,959
their food and their liquor.

982
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:41,000
-Liquor?
-Yes, liquor.

983
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:42,459
Amazing, isn't it?

984
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:45,167
-Let's have some drinks then.
-Yes.

985
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,542
-No, no, no.
-No!

986
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:49,000
Oh, no, today's Saturday, right?

987
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:50,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

988
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:51,167
Then it's okay
if I drink during the day.

989
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,959
-Wonderful.
-Let's go.

990
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,042
Dad, doctor has asked you not to.

991
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,042
Doctor doesn't know shit.

992
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:56,417
Don't say that. He too is a doctor.

993
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,417
No, I meant veterinary doctors.

994
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,875
Okay, we'll have
just a small drink.

995
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:03,000
-Let's go.
-No.

996
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:05,000
-It's okay.
-Dhruv, don't stop him. Let him.

997
00:56:05,084 --> 00:56:06,084
Go ahead, uncle.

998
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,250
Shunty, you too should
go get yourself a mocktail.

999
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:10,084
Absolut-ely.

1000
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,334
Come join us, Shunty.

1001
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,417
Shall we order?

1002
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,167
Cheers.

1003
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:24,292
You are
a very interesting man, sir.

1004
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,959
Not more interesting
than your imported liquor.

1005
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:30,459
No, sir.

1006
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,584
Love you, sir. Love you.

1007
00:56:35,584 --> 00:56:37,625
-Sir?
-Uncle, you have had three drinks.

1008
00:56:37,709 --> 00:56:39,959
I think you should
limit your intake now.

1009
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,209
Sunday!

1010
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:42,334
"Shunty."

1011
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:46,834
Shunty, I get to decide
my own limits. Not you. Got it?

1012
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:51,000
You must feel so proud.

1013
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:54,167
-Dhruv is such a big entrepreneur.
-Of course.

1014
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,459
-A lot.
-Such a bright boy.

1015
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,834
A lot.

1016
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,834
I feel so proud.

1017
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,459
You...

1018
00:57:06,542 --> 00:57:10,292
It hurts... a lot.

1019
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:13,542
Sir? Did I say anything wrong?

1020
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:17,125
-I love you, Deepti... Kashyap.
-Uncle.

1021
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,625
-I love you.
-Did I say anything wrong?

1022
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:27,917
Doc, he's a legend.
<i>A legend.</i>

1023
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:30,750
He still is so madly
in love with his wife.

1024
00:57:30,834 --> 00:57:32,375
But why is he crying?

1025
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,250
Dad, come...

1026
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,042
Love me.

1027
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,125
Marry me.

1028
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:46,875
Dad, please get up.

1029
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:48,792
I am not your father.

1030
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:49,875
What are you saying?

1031
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:51,334
I love you, Deepti.

1032
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:53,834
-Don't ruin the surprise.
-I love you with all my heart.

1033
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:56,459
-Don't ruin the surprise, uncle.
-Deepti, please marry me.

1034
00:57:56,542 --> 00:57:57,168
Don't cry.

1035
00:57:57,209 --> 00:57:58,959
Their 35th wedding anniversary
is approaching.

1036
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,834
It was supposed to be a surprise.
He was supposed to propose to her.

1037
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:03,084
-Dear, please tell her to marry me.
-Get up, Dad.

1038
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:05,459
-What are you doing, Dad?
-Deepti, please.

1039
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:09,042
-Stop it, please.
-I am ready to elope today.

1040
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:11,292
Stand up, Dad.

1041
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:14,334
-I am ready, Deepti.
-Dad!

1042
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:16,459
Mom!

1043
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:18,459
Deepti!

1044
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:19,792
Sir... what are you doing, sir?

1045
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,042
Deepti!

1046
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:24,459
Please turn off your camera, sir.

1047
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,334
Please, please.

1048
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:30,042
It was supposed to
be a surprise, but he...

1049
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:31,875
He had too much to drink.

1050
00:58:32,084 --> 00:58:33,459
Take care of yourself.

1051
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,250
What about lunch?

1052
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:46,250
I'll... go check on my parents.

1053
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:14,417
Hey!

1054
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,000
Dhruvi?

1055
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:19,959
Dhruvi? What? You want to pee?

1056
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,834
Really, Shunty!

1057
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:26,667
This was a bad idea.
It's a complete mess now.

1058
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:28,709
Yeah?

1059
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,167
It was a very bad idea
to get fake parents.

1060
00:59:30,459 --> 00:59:32,250
I lost both Anya and my reputation.

1061
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,000
Every hurdle
teaches you a lesson, bro.

1062
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:38,834
Aren't you the one who always said,
"I'll handle it"?

1063
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:40,542
You'll handle it, bro.

1064
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:42,959
Don't make me slap you.

1065
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:46,125
Stop preaching when
I'm on the verge of losing Anya.

1066
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:49,750
It's better than the advice you
gave me to jump in front of a train.

1067
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,083
It's over, Shunty.

1068
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,584
This is the limit.

1069
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:56,709
Height of embarrassment.

1070
00:59:56,792 --> 00:59:57,792
<i>I am not your father.</i>

1071
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,292
How can anyone behave like this?

1072
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,125
<i>I love you, Deepti.</i>

1073
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:02,084
I don't understand
the kind of people they are.

1074
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,500
It has gone viral.

1075
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:06,084
Should I tell everyone the doctor
is unwell? He's got a viral fever?

1076
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,000
Zip it.

1077
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:10,125
Kids should stay out of it.

1078
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:11,500
<i>Please tell her.</i>

1079
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:12,959
Neeta has no sense.

1080
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,750
She shared it in our family group.

1081
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:17,334
Look at how people
have reacted on it.

1082
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,709
"LOL."

1083
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,750
-"ROFL."
-ROFL!

1084
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:24,250
-Sorry.
-"This is lit."

1085
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:25,417
What does it mean?

1086
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,584
You don't know?

1087
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:27,709
You know?

1088
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,000
Of course, I do.

1089
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,334
Why don't you talk some sense
into her if you're that intelligent?

1090
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:35,500
You will regret this decision.
Saket is perfect for you.

1091
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:37,375
-His name is Sanket.
-Whatever.

1092
01:00:37,459 --> 01:00:40,667
-You just... Names don't matter.
-Drop it, Dad.

1093
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:43,750
It happens.
Some people get drunk easily.

1094
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:45,834
Why did he drink
in the first place?

1095
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:47,125
You offered it to him.

1096
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:48,209
I...

1097
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:50,209
-Okay.
-Okay then.

1098
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:54,584
Anyway, it's not like he fought
with someone after he got drunk.

1099
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,209
He just proposed...
to his own wife.

1100
01:00:57,292 --> 01:00:59,000
How sweet.
Don't you think, Mom?

1101
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:01,250
Who proposes to his wife
in this manner?

1102
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:03,834
This is exactly how
one should propose.

1103
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:05,875
You should take a leaf
out of his book.

1104
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:07,459
I agree.

1105
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:12,959
I asked you to talk
some sense into her.

1106
01:01:13,042 --> 01:01:15,292
Why are you lecturing me instead?

1107
01:01:16,959 --> 01:01:19,417
You don't understand
the concerns of a father.

1108
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:22,042
Look, dear,

1109
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,125
you should visit a house twice
before you buy it.

1110
01:01:25,709 --> 01:01:27,667
During daytime
and during night-time.

1111
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:30,125
During the day, you get
a better understanding of the house.

1112
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:33,250
While at night, you get a better
understanding of the locality.

1113
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,834
What do you mean?

1114
01:01:47,209 --> 01:01:48,459
I have been pondering over this
since last night.

1115
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,000
-I have an idea.
-What?

1116
01:01:50,959 --> 01:01:54,000
Let's send Purshottam
back to Shimla.

1117
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:57,959
We'll tell everyone
that he was drunk,

1118
01:01:58,042 --> 01:01:59,875
he missed his footing,
fell off a cliff, and...

1119
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,084
Death.

1120
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:03,625
Perfect. Let's just kill the father.
I'll still have a mother.

1121
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:05,125
I don't mind playing a widow.

1122
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:07,042
-How cruel.
-It is the best idea.

1123
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,917
You could make me sick,
put me in a coma.

1124
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:10,417
You can't just kill me.
This is not fair.

1125
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,042
What's the harm in playing dead
for a few days?

1126
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,500
Right, you can get back
to living later.

1127
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:16,084
-I couldn't help myself, Sunday.
-Why?

1128
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:18,125
I like to drink.

1129
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,750
-I couldn't refuse him.
-Why not?

1130
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:22,459
He is his father-in-law.
I had it for my son's sake.

1131
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:23,625
I wouldn't have gone
overboard otherwise.

1132
01:02:23,709 --> 01:02:26,667
However, you ruined it for him.
What about that?

1133
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,292
You could never do anything right.

1134
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,875
Wait, Anya is calling me.

1135
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:38,335
Hi, Anya.

1136
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,292
You all are coming over right now?

1137
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,959
But we aren't...

1138
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,459
Okay.

1139
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,459
-Ananya.
-"Anya!"

1140
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:51,876
-Anya.
-Hi, uncle.

1141
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:54,209
Anya, can you pass the phone
to your father?

1142
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:55,709
Please wait.

1143
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,083
His father. Please, please...

1144
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:01,334
Yes, Mr. Purshottam?

1145
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:03,125
Please don't come over, Doc.

1146
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,667
-Why?
-It's not an auspicious day.

1147
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,000
We too don't stay at home
on such an inauspicious day.

1148
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:10,459
How about a rain check?

1149
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:12,709
<i>What if you meet with an accident
on your way to our place?</i>

1150
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:13,501
Oh.

1151
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:15,959
Let me find an auspicious day
and get back to you.

1152
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,250
You can come over then.

1153
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:18,959
Yes, yes, yes.

1154
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,625
What is this man doing?

1155
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,667
He'll consult a priest
and let us know.

1156
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,834
This is one strange family.

1157
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:28,627
What now?

1158
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:32,917
Look, I promise
I won't make another mistake.

1159
01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:34,667
I won't misbehave.

1160
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,667
Please.

1161
01:03:35,917 --> 01:03:37,167
No drinking.

1162
01:03:37,334 --> 01:03:38,667
Not even a drop.

1163
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,584
You promise not to drink?

1164
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,375
You promise not to drink?

1165
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:47,334
Fine, I promise.

1166
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,917
I promised not to drink.

1167
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:53,667
And you'll keep your eyes off her.

1168
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,292
Look the other way. You are
not supposed to even look at her.

1169
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:56,667
You are looking at her!

1170
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,542
Your house looks
more like a hotel than a home.

1171
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,417
People will think I'm taking a leak
if I keep standing like this.

1172
01:04:02,709 --> 01:04:04,375
I, too, command some respect,
you know.

1173
01:04:04,459 --> 01:04:06,418
Oh, uncle! Come with me.

1174
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:10,542
Keys?

1175
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:13,042
Can I ask something?

1176
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:15,542
Why haven't you installed
a doorbell?

1177
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:18,042
Because I didn't need one.

1178
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:22,584
That looks more like a household
while this place looks cold.

1179
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:23,959
We need to turn it into a home.

1180
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:26,002
Why?

1181
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:28,709
Because Anya is coming over.

1182
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,167
Coming!
Give me a second.

1183
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,375
What are you doing, man?

1184
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,542
Hello.

1185
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:44,250
Keep them coming!

1186
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:48,584
-What are you doing, man?
-Dhruv!

1187
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,875
For good luck.

1188
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,292
-What are you looking for?
-No... nothing!

1189
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:27,209
What's wrong?

1190
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:31,875
Water...

1191
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:33,625
You want some water?

1192
01:05:33,709 --> 01:05:35,084
No, thank you.

1193
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,917
Most important fact,
especially for you.

1194
01:05:59,042 --> 01:05:59,917
What's her name?

1195
01:06:00,334 --> 01:06:01,542
Ananya.

1196
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,959
-"Anya."
-How many times do we go through this?

1197
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:05,875
-Anya!
-Anya!

1198
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:07,125
Okay.

1199
01:06:23,834 --> 01:06:25,959
How about a housing-warming
party in the evening?

1200
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:31,584
Dhruv.
Dhruv, hold on for a second.

1201
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,042
Take this.

1202
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:36,042
Awesome.

1203
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:38,042
-What is this?
-Mother's love.

1204
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,625
Boxed lunch?
Don't worry. I'll have it.

1205
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,042
We've added almost all tourism sites
in your app over a period of one year.

1206
01:06:49,834 --> 01:06:50,752
Yeah.

1207
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:54,375
We even did a promotional event
for Haj.

1208
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:58,125
But the sales...
Sales are not going anywhere.

1209
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:03,625
Sir, good products
need good marketing.

1210
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,459
All right.

1211
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:12,209
But why are our consumers
not consuming the content?

1212
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:16,875
I can wear the VR for hours,

1213
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:23,042
but when I take it off,
there's no product experience.

1214
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,459
Sir, actually...
I have an idea, sir.

1215
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,042
-Yes?
-I have researched--

1216
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,667
Sir, I think we should
add some music to the visuals.

1217
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:34,125
I think voiceover gets too boring.
It sounds like a news bulletin.

1218
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,167
That is something we can try.

1219
01:07:36,959 --> 01:07:39,917
If we don't start making profits
by the next quarter,

1220
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,792
your capital turns to zero.

1221
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:46,167
You very well know what zero means.

1222
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:53,209
You'll just have to
leave everything... and walk away.

1223
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:56,917
Yeah.

1224
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:05,667
Why bother looking in the mirror?

1225
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:09,084
You are more beautiful
than your image.

1226
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:16,834
Who's at the door?

1227
01:08:20,917 --> 01:08:22,709
-Hi, uncle.
-Hi.

1228
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:25,125
Welcome!
Welcome home!

1229
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,292
-Watch your head, dear.
-Hi.

1230
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,375
Hello, auntie.

1231
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:30,709
-Hi. How are you?
-Hello, sir.

1232
01:08:31,042 --> 01:08:32,417
Today's an auspicious day.

1233
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,042
Nothing can go wrong today, sir.

1234
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,042
Please come in.

1235
01:08:36,334 --> 01:08:37,834
Hello.

1236
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,834
Now, where do we make him sit?

1237
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:42,250
You can sit there if you
have a back problem. It's cushioned.

1238
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:42,834
Okay.

1239
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:44,375
But if you are suffering
from a cold, you should sit here.

1240
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:45,834
That's where air-conditioner's
draft is the strongest.

1241
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,292
-You can sit wherever you please.
-I'll sit over here.

1242
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,792
-Tea for everyone?
-Settle down, dear.

1243
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:49,917
-Sit wherever you please.
-She'll sit here.

1244
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:50,876
Sit.

1245
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:53,042
Email is there,
but FB's always easy.

1246
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:54,875
One second.

1247
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:56,125
-Hello?
-Hello, Dhruv?

1248
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:58,625
Dhruv...

1249
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,542
-Anya and her family are here.
-Where?

1250
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:03,875
At home, obviously.

1251
01:09:03,917 --> 01:09:06,209
Purshottam has already
started blabbering.

1252
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:08,834
Come over immediately. He...

1253
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:10,625
Anyway, come over.
Come soon, please.

1254
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:12,709
You keep Premi uncle under check.
I'm on my way.

1255
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:14,334
I'm on my way home.

1256
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:29,917
His school photographs.

1257
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,167
Auntie, come, sit.

1258
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,584
His nose is a little different.

1259
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,042
He loves to dig up old graves.

1260
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:41,584
-Excuse me?
-Dabbu.

1261
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:44,084
He used to dig his nose,
so his nostrils flared up.

1262
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,750
Some things are
better left untouched.

1263
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:51,084
Yeah.

1264
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:53,084
Correct.

1265
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,667
Pick up!

1266
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,542
This was his second birthday.

1267
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:13,917
Can I have a toothpick?

1268
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:15,834
Excuse me?

1269
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:16,959
A toothpick?

1270
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:18,709
A toothpick?

1271
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:20,917
How about a bamboo?

1272
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,917
I mean a bamboo toothpick.

1273
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:27,167
It's safe and effective.
I'll go get it.

1274
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,875
Guard your teeth
while I go and get it.

1275
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:29,917
Okay.

1276
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:34,917
This is when we were in college,
during a debating competition.

1277
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,625
That's where we first met.

1278
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:39,334
I still remember the topic.

1279
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:42,334
Hindi versus English.

1280
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:45,334
That's where we first met.

1281
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:54,792
-Doc?
-Yeah?

1282
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,917
Toothpick.

1283
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:57,834
That's a copper wire.

1284
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:58,917
Copper wire.

1285
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,500
-It will hurt my gums.
-No!

1286
01:11:01,584 --> 01:11:03,709
Just like a copper
wire helps a bulb light up,

1287
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,875
it will also make your teeth shine.

1288
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:08,834
-White and bright always.
-Okay.

1289
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,834
How did you get married?

1290
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:13,875
Our wedding nev...

1291
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:16,917
It was difficult back then.

1292
01:11:17,834 --> 01:11:19,167
Our parents wouldn't agree.

1293
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,917
We decided to elope.

1294
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,375
We managed to get
as far as the station,

1295
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,209
but then we got caught.

1296
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,918
Then?

1297
01:11:32,959 --> 01:11:35,459
We stayed determined.

1298
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,542
Our families eventually gave in,
and we got married.

1299
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,084
So, you eloped...

1300
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,667
So, you two eloped?

1301
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,584
It was a trend, Doc.

1302
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:51,375
It was a trend back in the days.
Everyone used to elope.

1303
01:11:51,459 --> 01:11:52,959
-Is it?
-I had a bike.

1304
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,542
An epic romantic movie
had just released.

1305
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,334
I couldn't lose the opportunity.

1306
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:58,834
But we came back the same day.

1307
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:01,459
But Ms. Deepti just said
that you guys got caught.

1308
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:03,042
Exactly.
You guys got caught, right?

1309
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:05,875
We had to come back
because we got caught.

1310
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:07,959
-I see.
-My bike's tank was full.

1311
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:09,167
I could have gone
anywhere I wanted.

1312
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,625
Right.

1313
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,542
Sir, sir, sir.
You cannot park here, sir.

1314
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:23,792
-Park it. I am in a hurry.
-It's wrong. I can't allow it, sir!

1315
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:27,417
Hey! You are home early.

1316
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,209
You... when did you come?

1317
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,667
Why didn't you tell me, Mom?

1318
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,875
I would have brought
some snacks with me.

1319
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:34,167
We are stuffed, son.

1320
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:35,709
All good, Dad?

1321
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:37,584
Yes. I was just about
to get rid of the doctor.

1322
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,459
-What?
-I mean I was about to see him off.

1323
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:41,000
You guys are leaving already?

1324
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:42,250
-Yes, we are.
-Yes, they were about to leave.

1325
01:12:42,334 --> 01:12:45,667
Yes, we are. But Anya will
stay here tonight with all of you.

1326
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,251
Yes.

1327
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:48,834
Then based on her feedback,
we'll decide whether--

1328
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:49,751
Nothing, nothing.

1329
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:51,250
-She wanted to, so...
-Stupid.

1330
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:53,250
No, that's great.
Nice, nice. Of course, of course.

1331
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:54,210
Here you go, sir.

1332
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,834
-Oh, yes.
-What's this?

1333
01:12:55,917 --> 01:12:58,542
I had something stuck in my tooth,
so he offered me a copper wire.

1334
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,709
-Yes, he does that.
-Your dad is very funny.

1335
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:01,792
-That he is.
-Bye.

1336
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:02,917
Take care.

1337
01:13:03,042 --> 01:13:04,792
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

1338
01:13:05,917 --> 01:13:07,209
Come.

1339
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:10,917
Are you really staying back?

1340
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,500
You don't want me to?

1341
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,917
No! Nice.

1342
01:13:14,209 --> 01:13:16,084
-Surprise.
-Surprise.

1343
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:17,834
Would you like something?

1344
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:19,167
Maybe a cup of green tea
or a glass of lemonade...

1345
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,834
Oh, you guys are already
through with that.

1346
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:21,917
Whiskey?

1347
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:25,168
Whiskey? Whiskey?

1348
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:27,792
Whiskey.

1349
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:31,042
Whiskey?

1350
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,250
Whose is it?

1351
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,042
Whiskey.

1352
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:37,875
Risky.

1353
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,500
-Dhruv?
-Yeah?

1354
01:13:53,709 --> 01:13:55,125
Not now. I am...

1355
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:56,625
Damn it.

1356
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,709
Fine, tell me.

1357
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:03,875
Need help.

1358
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:07,125
What happened?
Indigestion?

1359
01:14:07,584 --> 01:14:08,750
Deepti.

1360
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:11,209
You should reconsider.

1361
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,125
Premi uncle, why take a path
that only leads to disappointments?

1362
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:18,500
-Come back, come back.
-No, Dhruv. No.

1363
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,917
We should strike
while the iron is still hot.

1364
01:14:20,959 --> 01:14:23,084
-Today when Anya's family came over...
-Yeah?

1365
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,625
...Deepti told them about
our college debate competition.

1366
01:14:27,542 --> 01:14:32,084
Deepti had tears
in her eyes, Dhruv.

1367
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:35,500
She was giving a good performance.
and sticking to her character.

1368
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:37,209
You should learn from her.

1369
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:39,917
Forget about her. You are here
to help me get married.

1370
01:14:39,959 --> 01:14:41,375
What about me?

1371
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:48,334
Fine, we'll take up your matter
after I get married.

1372
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,584
-Promise?
-Yes.

1373
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:53,292
-You think it's possible, Dhruv?
-100%

1374
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,834
-You think so?
-Of course.

1375
01:14:56,917 --> 01:15:00,625
Why do I feel...
that it's impossible?

1376
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:02,834
On second thoughts,
even I don't think it's possible.

1377
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:03,917
Huh?

1378
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,667
You too feel the same?

1379
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,209
-I have a feeling it's impossible.
-Right?

1380
01:15:07,209 --> 01:15:08,334
I don't think it's possible.

1381
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:09,709
What's not possible?

1382
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:11,667
What...

1383
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,917
Uncle, I hope you don't have
a problem with me staying here.

1384
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:18,959
-No dear, not at all.
-No. What were we talking about?

1385
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:20,084
What's not possible?

1386
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,250
-We're so busy with your wedding...
-Yes.

1387
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:28,375
...that it's not possible to
celebrate our wedding anniversary.

1388
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:30,542
Why is it not possible?

1389
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:32,292
Hang on a second.

1390
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:34,917
First, uncle and auntie's wedding
anniversary, and then our marriage.

1391
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:35,877
Okay?

1392
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:39,042
No, actually, he too isn't up to it.
He was just telling me that.

1393
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:41,834
No, if she has made up her mind,
then so have I.

1394
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:44,792
We'll obviously celebrate it.
It's their 35th wedding anniversary!

1395
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:45,751
You are so mean.

1396
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:47,542
You know what?
You shouldn't bother about it.

1397
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:50,667
Uncle, I will plan everything,
and I will stay here until then.

1398
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,500
Thank you, dear. Thank you.
Thank you.

1399
01:15:52,834 --> 01:15:55,750
But why have you doused yourself
with perfume? Where are you going?

1400
01:15:56,959 --> 01:16:00,792
He tends to fart a lot, so I use
some perfume before going to bed.

1401
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:03,250
Oh. Then go to bed.

1402
01:16:03,584 --> 01:16:04,667
-I should go to bed?
-Go to bed.

1403
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:06,625
-Come on. It's time for my farts.
-Good night.

1404
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,084
-Good night.
-Let me escort you to your room.

1405
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:10,167
No, she'll manage.

1406
01:16:18,584 --> 01:16:19,917
Go to bed.

1407
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,667
Go to bed, son.

1408
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:27,125
You were so raring to go.
What a missed opportunity!

1409
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:30,917
What did you say?

1410
01:16:31,584 --> 01:16:32,584
What did you tell him?

1411
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,125
"I should strike
while the iron is still hot."

1412
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:36,667
-So, I am a hot iron, huh?
-No, no, no.

1413
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,917
It was a mistake.

1414
01:16:37,959 --> 01:16:38,959
It was a mistake.

1415
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:41,084
You want to celebrate
our wedding anniversary, huh?

1416
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:42,375
It was a mistake. No!

1417
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:44,792
-Try it.
-What's going on? Are you okay?

1418
01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:48,792
I'm trying to save
my skin... from dance.

1419
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:50,292
From dance?

1420
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:53,917
I thought we should dance
on our wedding anniversary.

1421
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,250
Like this?

1422
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:56,584
Do it!

1423
01:16:56,917 --> 01:17:00,834
Auntie, I think we should try
something other than classical.

1424
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:02,125
It's a good idea.

1425
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:04,000
-How about Bollywood?
-Bollywood?

1426
01:17:04,084 --> 01:17:04,959
-Yes.
-Bollywood.

1427
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:07,042
Finalise the song,
I'll be right back.

1428
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:08,500
Finalise the song.

1429
01:17:08,584 --> 01:17:10,500
I don't think
he can handle classical.

1430
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:11,959
He's good for nothing.

1431
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:33,000
<i>"I have never seen God"</i>

1432
01:17:33,084 --> 01:17:37,167
<i>"But I got an opportunity
To see you"</i>

1433
01:17:37,292 --> 01:17:41,250
<i>"I have never touched God"</i>

1434
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:44,792
<i>"But I got an opportunity
To touch your love"</i>

1435
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:53,167
<i>"My heart weeps when you cry"</i>

1436
01:17:53,292 --> 01:17:57,625
<i>"I'll have nothing to worry about
If I have you by my side"</i>

1437
01:17:57,709 --> 01:18:00,917
<i>"Don't worry about anything"</i>

1438
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:08,875
<i>"In sickness and in health"
We'll always be together"</i>

1439
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:12,875
<i>"We'll always carry on
Nothing can stop us"</i>

1440
01:18:12,917 --> 01:18:17,042
<i>"Nothing can stop us"</i>

1441
01:18:29,292 --> 01:18:33,750
<i>"Nothing can stop us"</i>

1442
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:38,000
<i>"You are one in a million"</i>

1443
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:42,250
<i>"You are the one for me"</i>

1444
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:46,459
<i>"I am lucky to have you"</i>

1445
01:18:46,542 --> 01:18:50,500
<i>"I have to thank my stars for that"</i>

1446
01:18:50,584 --> 01:18:58,417
<i>"I want to be at your service
Always"</i>

1447
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:02,750
<i>"I'll have nothing to worry about

1448
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:05,834
<i>"Don't worry about anything"</i>

1449
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:13,917
<i>"We'll be together

1450
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:22,500
<i>"We'll always carry on

1451
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,250
-God bless you.
-Hey.

1452
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:32,167
-He is asking for a donation.
-Oh.

1453
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:34,125
This man, I tell you.

1454
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:35,335
Here.

1455
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,917
I'll RTGS the rest.

1456
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Thank you.

1457
01:19:38,084 --> 01:19:39,334
Whose name do I mention here?

1458
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,375
Dhruv and Anya.

1459
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:43,459
Okay.

1460
01:19:44,459 --> 01:19:46,542
May they always stay together.

1461
01:20:12,334 --> 01:20:13,334
Dhruv?

1462
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:15,917
-May I come in?
-Yeah, yeah. Come, come, come.

1463
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,625
Good morning.

1464
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,084
Sit, sit, sit. Come.

1465
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:21,917
Be comfortable. Come.

1466
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,584
Tell me one thing, Niyati?

1467
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:31,917
Have you ever missed a trip?
With family or friends?

1468
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,334
Yeah.

1469
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:36,667
Because of
last event's preparation,

1470
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:38,917
I couldn't go to Hampi
with my family.

1471
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:41,125
Oh, yeah, I am sorry.

1472
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:43,292
But no problem.

1473
01:20:43,959 --> 01:20:46,209
Our office will sponsor
your next family trip.

1474
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:49,834
Thank you, Dhruv.

1475
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:50,917
Not at all.

1476
01:20:52,584 --> 01:20:53,667
Now just think...

1477
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:58,250
what if you can experience all
family trips that you have missed,

1478
01:20:58,334 --> 01:21:01,875
or will miss in the future,
through our VR device and app?

1479
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,959
Wow, you mean...

1480
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:05,500
Yes.

1481
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:08,125
The memories people can't be
a part of even if they wanted?

1482
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:10,625
Let's make them a part of it.

1483
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:13,667
If you can't go to Agra
with your family

1484
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:16,125
and touch the pillars
of Taj Mahal...

1485
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:18,542
if you can't share the famous
Murthal's <i>parathas</i>...

1486
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:20,334
if you don't make it to dinner,

1487
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,292
then you are not living
your life to the fullest.

1488
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:24,625
Right?

1489
01:21:25,584 --> 01:21:29,084
Our journeys are all about spending
such moments with our family.

1490
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:31,375
Traveling is just an excuse.

1491
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:34,834
So, you mean we have cracked it?

1492
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:36,875
Of course, we have.

1493
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:37,835
Yes.

1494
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:38,709
Wow.

1495
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,292
Now come on, we have lots to do.

1496
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,250
Let's help people
in overcoming the FOMO.

1497
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:43,001
Sure, sir.

1498
01:21:43,042 --> 01:21:45,209
I'll make a PPT and mail it
to the team. Go through it.

1499
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:46,417
Yeah, sure.

1500
01:21:49,792 --> 01:21:50,875
-Dhruv?
-Yeah?

1501
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:52,667
-May I ask you something?
-No.

1502
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:54,542
Yes, of course.

1503
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:56,084
What's gotten into you?

1504
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:00,875
I'll see you.

1505
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,750
Ma'am?

1506
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:13,375
Where can I find Dhruv Shikhar?

1507
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:16,667
Thank you.

1508
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:28,250
It's a big office.

1509
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,125
You are a big shot.

1510
01:22:32,042 --> 01:22:34,000
How naive of me to bring you lunch.

1511
01:22:34,084 --> 01:22:35,250
Please, it's yours.

1512
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,667
Come, let me show you something.

1513
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:40,584
That's our logo.

1514
01:22:40,834 --> 01:22:42,084
Jaadugar.

1515
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:43,917
It's my app.

1516
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:45,917
That's our workspace.

1517
01:22:46,209 --> 01:22:47,626
That's where
our technical team sits.

1518
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:48,834
-Yes, I saw.
-In that room.

1519
01:22:48,917 --> 01:22:50,000
My cabin's over there.

1520
01:22:50,084 --> 01:22:51,584
I'll show it to you on the way out.

1521
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,209
I guess Varun's office
must be similar to this one.

1522
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:04,625
He too works in the IT industry.

1523
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:07,875
You have never been to his office?

1524
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,209
We don't speak with each other.

1525
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:19,084
But you said
that you keep in touch.

1526
01:23:22,917 --> 01:23:25,709
When he decided to marry Linda,

1527
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:32,500
Naveen, his father, and I...

1528
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:36,084
We argued.

1529
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:38,834
We tried to scare him,
threaten him.

1530
01:23:41,334 --> 01:23:42,667
We didn't act maturely.

1531
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:45,042
He got so upset that

1532
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:47,917
he didn't even attend
Naveen's funeral.

1533
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:53,209
When he had a daughter,
someone on Facebook had...

1534
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:04,459
Relationships
are very fragile, son.

1535
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,625
They shouldn't be based on lies.

1536
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,709
Once broken,
they are very difficult to mend.

1537
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:18,459
You should tell Anya the truth.

1538
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,834
She is a smart girl.
She will understand.

1539
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:28,542
I have already lost Varun.

1540
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,125
I don't want to lose you as well.

1541
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:39,042
I don't want to lose this family.

1542
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:48,000
And I want to dance
at your wedding.

1543
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,375
But you will have
to handle Purshottam.

1544
01:24:51,459 --> 01:24:52,917
He doesn't listen to anyone.

1545
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:55,127
He'll always do the opposite
of what you expect.

1546
01:24:55,709 --> 01:24:57,292
I am fed up with him.

1547
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,167
Thank you.

1548
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:14,584
Hey...
What are you doing?

1549
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,834
My mom's visiting my office
for the first time.

1550
01:25:19,917 --> 01:25:21,250
Let me set the table.

1551
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:27,375
I had never thought that
I'll get to eat home-cooked meals.

1552
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:37,625
<i>Yes, I remember. You have
forbidden me from coming here.</i>

1553
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:40,250
<i>Why did you come back then?</i>

1554
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:44,417
<i>To find out why can't I come here.</i>

1555
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:46,792
-<i>Amar Prem</i> again?
-Eternal love.

1556
01:25:47,917 --> 01:25:50,875
<i>Your wife doesn't want you
to come here.</i>

1557
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,042
How many times will you
keep watching the same movie?

1558
01:25:54,417 --> 01:25:55,959
For as long as there is love
in this world.

1559
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:58,459
<i>What will you gain
by hurting her feelings?</i>

1560
01:25:58,625 --> 01:25:59,792
<i>Happiness.</i>

1561
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:04,000
<i>This is where I find happiness.</i>

1562
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:05,917
<i>With you.</i>

1563
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:09,459
-Why?
-I need to talk to you.

1564
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:14,792
All this
that I am doing for Anya...

1565
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:18,792
I mean all of this...

1566
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,959
Do you think it is
the right thing to do?

1567
01:26:22,959 --> 01:26:24,875
Yes, of course.

1568
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:26,876
You sure?

1569
01:26:26,917 --> 01:26:28,917
That's what you do
when you are in love.

1570
01:26:29,459 --> 01:26:31,084
You go all out.

1571
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:32,875
Right?

1572
01:26:35,167 --> 01:26:37,125
You cannot behave like I did.

1573
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:42,167
I stayed in her city for 10 years,

1574
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:45,834
but I couldn't gather
the courage to talk to her.

1575
01:26:50,917 --> 01:26:51,917
Dhruv?

1576
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,417
You are what I wanted to be...

1577
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:02,292
but I could never be.

1578
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:09,959
I don't idolise movie stars.

1579
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:13,209
I idolise you.

1580
01:27:16,584 --> 01:27:19,250
My Super Commando Dhruv.

1581
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,917
Cheers.

1582
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:22,917
Turn it on.

1583
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,834
Your love is true.

1584
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:42,459
Okay then, I'll go and change.

1585
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:52,875
Doc, this must be your first case
where the prospective bride

1586
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:58,792
has come to her parents' place with
her in-laws to finalise her wedding.

1587
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:00,875
We have a modern family.

1588
01:28:00,917 --> 01:28:02,584
-Thank you. That's enough.
-One more.

1589
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:03,959
Mom, tea for you.

1590
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:06,000
Thank you, dear.

1591
01:28:06,334 --> 01:28:09,459
You know, he always wanted...

1592
01:28:09,959 --> 01:28:13,875
I mean,
he always wanted a daughter.

1593
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:17,500
It's finally happening.
We'll soon have a daughter-in-law.

1594
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:19,125
I am not going to
be your daughter-in-law.

1595
01:28:19,209 --> 01:28:22,084
I am going to be your daughter,
just like he is your son. Got it?

1596
01:28:25,959 --> 01:28:27,667
How about a selfie?

1597
01:28:27,959 --> 01:28:29,292
Sure.

1598
01:28:30,459 --> 01:28:32,959
Come on. Come here, dear.

1599
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Here.

1600
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:38,042
You should shift closer to her.

1601
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:40,917
Smile, please.

1602
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:42,542
Wait, wait.

1603
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,625
Barfi!

1604
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:47,125
Wow, so cute.

1605
01:28:47,209 --> 01:28:48,375
Let me see.

1606
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:51,292
Good?

1607
01:28:51,917 --> 01:28:53,500
-Dabbu?
-Yes?

1608
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:57,375
You should frame it before
uploading it on Facebook.

1609
01:28:57,459 --> 01:28:58,750
It's good, isn't it?

1610
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:03,250
Thank you, dear.

1611
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:05,500
Thank you? Why?

1612
01:29:07,334 --> 01:29:11,042
I don't think I could've found you
a better boy, a better family for you.

1613
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:15,417
I am missing your parents.

1614
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,792
Dad!

1615
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:22,042
Sir, as I was saying,
today is a very auspicious day.

1616
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:23,125
Yes.

1617
01:29:23,209 --> 01:29:25,750
So, why don't we call a priest
and fix the wedding date?

1618
01:29:25,834 --> 01:29:28,542
No, the date's already fixed.
The day we celebrate our anniversary.

1619
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:29,834
Right?

1620
01:29:31,917 --> 01:29:36,917
He means it'd be great
if they get married on the day

1621
01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:39,000
we celebrate our anniversary.

1622
01:29:39,334 --> 01:29:40,834
Perfect. It's decided then.

1623
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,584
We'll have the invitation cards
printed by the end of this week.

1624
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:44,792
You should invite
all your relatives, sir.

1625
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:46,834
Don't miss out anyone.
Okay.

1626
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:48,584
It will be fun
if all your relatives are here.

1627
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:50,792
Why do we need to invite relatives?

1628
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:51,917
Let's have an intimate wedding.

1629
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:53,209
No, we have to invite everyone.

1630
01:29:53,292 --> 01:29:54,793
We'll have to invite
all our relatives.

1631
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:56,875
Why make them travel
such a long distance?

1632
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:58,292
Let's have a simple wedding.
Right?

1633
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:00,834
Dhruv, this is the first wedding
in our family.

1634
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:02,084
We will have to invite everyone.

1635
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,250
First wedding, how?

1636
01:30:03,334 --> 01:30:04,750
Aren't you two married?

1637
01:30:05,917 --> 01:30:07,750
You are so funny, sir.

1638
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:12,875
Son, Punjabi weddings
are no fun without relatives.

1639
01:30:12,917 --> 01:30:14,584
We'd love to introduce
our relatives to you.

1640
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:15,792
Tell him, dear.

1641
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:18,042
We'll have a grand wedding.
We'll invite all our relatives.

1642
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:19,125
Right.

1643
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:23,918
-We'll invite all our relatives?
-Each and every one of them.

1644
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,084
We'll invite all our relatives.

1645
01:30:44,959 --> 01:30:48,542
Son, you should enjoy the food
while it's still fresh.

1646
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:50,750
You should eat on time,
or else you'll get acidity.

1647
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:51,334
Right.

1648
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:52,750
Where are your relatives?

1649
01:30:53,209 --> 01:30:54,667
Yes, where are they?

1650
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,250
The dumplings will harden.

1651
01:30:56,334 --> 01:30:59,167
-The dessert will go cold.
-What could be the reason for the delay?

1652
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:00,834
-The bus overturned.
-Huh?

1653
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:01,584
Yes.

1654
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:04,209
That's unfortunate.
Should I call the DM?

1655
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,834
No, the bus in front
of theirs overturned.

1656
01:31:07,917 --> 01:31:09,125
-Okay.
-So, the road's blocked.

1657
01:31:09,209 --> 01:31:10,542
I don't think
they'll be able to make it.

1658
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,084
We should go ahead with the ceremony
or the food will go bad.

1659
01:31:14,834 --> 01:31:17,000
I think your bus is here.

1660
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:23,084
Isn't it?

1661
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:24,251
Yes.

1662
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:26,917
Oh, the bus behind
theirs had overturned.

1663
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,875
You get a lot of misinformation
on phones these days.

1664
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:31,709
I'll go greet them.

1665
01:31:32,917 --> 01:31:34,167
We are here.
We are here. We are here.

1666
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,750
Who are they?
From where did you get them?

1667
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:38,250
One-stop solution
to all your wedding woes.

1668
01:31:38,334 --> 01:31:40,625
The one and only Shaadiram.

1669
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:46,750
I want to know the truth.

1670
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:48,250
Does he possess
your naked pictures?

1671
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:50,167
-What...
-Why do you keep promoting him?

1672
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,875
He will make your wedding
a memorable one.

1673
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:52,835
What are you saying?

1674
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:54,375
He's going to mess everything up.

1675
01:31:54,584 --> 01:31:56,167
They all look so dangerous
and deadly.

1676
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:57,292
Who are these people?

1677
01:31:57,917 --> 01:32:00,167
Look at that girl in the red dress.

1678
01:32:00,334 --> 01:32:01,625
So much make-up.

1679
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:03,750
Has she dipped her face
in her make-up products?

1680
01:32:03,834 --> 01:32:05,417
She is my cousin.

1681
01:32:06,084 --> 01:32:08,792
She looks so nice.
She is my cousin as well, but...

1682
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:11,917
I have connected with
the rest of the family as well.

1683
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,500
They are good people.

1684
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,875
Shunty, this is not the time to
get sentimental. It's my wedding.

1685
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:18,167
For God's sake, why are you all
walking in a straight line?

1686
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,959
It's no use helping
your friends these days.

1687
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:24,084
Everyone will queue up
for lunch, okay?

1688
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,167
No one will go overboard,
got it?

1689
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:28,750
What's the count?
98, 99...

1690
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,084
Stop at 100.

1691
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:36,000
Hello. Welcome.
Please carry on. Hurry up.

1692
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:37,709
Hello, sir.

1693
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:39,834
-Hello.
-Hello.

1694
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:40,750
Hello.

1695
01:32:40,834 --> 01:32:43,375
-Don't worry about the payment.
-Huh?

1696
01:32:43,459 --> 01:32:45,125
I mean, how are you?

1697
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:46,459
Great arrangement.

1698
01:32:46,584 --> 01:32:48,209
Lovely flowers.

1699
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:49,542
Very good. Come.

1700
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:52,750
-My in-law!
-Yes.

1701
01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:54,167
Please stay in the queue.

1702
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,834
How about an introduction?

1703
01:32:55,917 --> 01:32:58,209
He's Sanjeev.

1704
01:32:58,292 --> 01:32:59,292
Dr. Sanjeev.

1705
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:00,667
Dr. Sanjeev Mehra.

1706
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,209
Ananya's father.

1707
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:03,875
Anya.

1708
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:05,125
Who's Anya?

1709
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:07,167
My daughter, your daughter-in-law.

1710
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:11,500
Oh, yes, he is my future
daughter-in-law's father.

1711
01:33:11,584 --> 01:33:12,917
Yes.

1712
01:33:13,375 --> 01:33:14,750
And you are?

1713
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,125
He is him.

1714
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:19,000
Oh, you are him.

1715
01:33:19,084 --> 01:33:20,584
Yes, I am me.

1716
01:33:20,792 --> 01:33:21,834
Uncle!

1717
01:33:21,917 --> 01:33:23,542
We have been looking for you.

1718
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:26,959
He is my wife's brother.

1719
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:30,292
Since when did you
starting eating beetle leaf?

1720
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:32,584
Ever since
you started eating the same.

1721
01:33:32,959 --> 01:33:35,667
Kidding. It's just a little
something to welcome the guests.

1722
01:33:38,459 --> 01:33:39,959
He had shifted to Dubai.
Dubai.

1723
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:41,917
He's meeting Dad
after a long time, so...

1724
01:33:41,959 --> 01:33:43,501
-He just came over for the wedding.
-Dad?

1725
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:44,917
-Yes.
-His father.

1726
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:47,292
-Dad!
-Dad!

1727
01:33:48,084 --> 01:33:51,459
-What about the mother?
-What did you say?

1728
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,292
I mean where's your mother
who also happens to be my sister?

1729
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:55,792
-Won't I get to meet her?
-Where's Mom?

1730
01:33:56,292 --> 01:33:57,750
-Where's his mother?
-Where is she?

1731
01:33:57,834 --> 01:33:58,959
-Mom?
-Mom.

1732
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:00,917
Mom...

1733
01:34:01,167 --> 01:34:04,625
Well, you know moms.
Moms are everywhere.

1734
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:05,459
Mom...

1735
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:07,167
He's Sudama.

1736
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:09,500
-Uncle Sudama...
-From Dubai.

1737
01:34:09,584 --> 01:34:10,792
Let's go inside.
Let's go inside, uncle.

1738
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:11,917
-Yes.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1739
01:34:11,959 --> 01:34:13,500
The dry fruits are...

1740
01:34:13,917 --> 01:34:14,959
Where's your mom?

1741
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,917
Let's go inside,
I'll introduce you to everyone.

1742
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:19,667
Seriously, Shunty, everything
was going on so smoothly.

1743
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,500
Why did you have
to create this mess?

1744
01:34:21,584 --> 01:34:23,084
Weddings are like projects
in our country.

1745
01:34:23,167 --> 01:34:24,500
We are creating memories here.

1746
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:26,334
-Memories, huh?
-Excuse me, sir?

1747
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:32,250
What if this resort catches fire
before the wedding?

1748
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:34,292
-Huh?
-What if there is a flood?

1749
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:37,542
What if there's a robbery or murder?
What if the groom runs away?

1750
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:39,792
What if the wedding
gets called off?

1751
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:42,542
You have such a nice personality.

1752
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:43,709
Why don't you stick
to saying nice things?

1753
01:34:43,792 --> 01:34:44,875
It's my daughter's wedding.

1754
01:34:45,084 --> 01:34:46,209
Stick to saying only nice things.

1755
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,959
No, I am an insurance agent.
You should buy insurance from me.

1756
01:34:49,042 --> 01:34:53,750
-Myself Ghasitaram Ghantiwala.
-Uncle!

1757
01:34:53,834 --> 01:34:54,875
You are late!

1758
01:34:54,917 --> 01:34:56,792
-He's your uncle?
-Hello.

1759
01:34:56,875 --> 01:35:00,917
He's my elder brother,
but he always acts childishly.

1760
01:35:01,084 --> 01:35:02,668
He cheats people in
the name of insurance.

1761
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:04,459
He takes the money,
but people don't die.

1762
01:35:04,542 --> 01:35:06,334
He has been selling insurance
since the past 35 years.

1763
01:35:06,417 --> 01:35:07,750
So it has become
a part of his personality.

1764
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:09,584
-Right.
-That is not true.

1765
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:10,917
I do a good job.

1766
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,167
Our company has been
around for a century now.

1767
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,917
He's selling death at a wedding.

1768
01:35:16,542 --> 01:35:17,959
He scares everyone
by talking about death.

1769
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:20,000
-Let's go.
-He wants to set this place on fire?

1770
01:35:20,084 --> 01:35:22,209
Selling insurance has become
a part of his personality.

1771
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:25,750
Yes, wear your glasses.

1772
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:31,459
Damn it.

1773
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:45,750
Chintu is a not a kid.
He's a little monster.

1774
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:47,167
He stole mobile phones
from the guests.

1775
01:35:47,459 --> 01:35:48,959
He pushed Shaadiram into the pool.

1776
01:35:49,292 --> 01:35:50,875
He was jumping around
like a wet puppy.

1777
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:52,834
I saw.
Don't worry, Dhruvi.

1778
01:35:52,917 --> 01:35:54,334
We'll get them. We'll get them all.

1779
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:55,917
All this is getting to my nerves.
What are you...

1780
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:57,875
What... Hey!
What are you up to now?

1781
01:35:57,917 --> 01:35:59,042
What is this, huh?

1782
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:00,542
Whose dress have you stolen now?

1783
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:01,542
Hey!

1784
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:03,959
I'll punch you.

1785
01:36:04,834 --> 01:36:06,917
You little monster, I'll slap you.

1786
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,542
Hey!
What are you doing?

1787
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:11,459
Hey! It will ruin
the wedding photographs.

1788
01:36:12,334 --> 01:36:13,667
That will ruin the wedding night.

1789
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:16,167
Don't do that, kiddo.
Watch out!

1790
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,834
Hey, hey, hey.

1791
01:36:23,709 --> 01:36:24,834
You okay, Dhruvi?

1792
01:36:24,917 --> 01:36:26,334
Left? Right?

1793
01:36:27,667 --> 01:36:28,917
Both of them?
Oh, no.

1794
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:30,667
Shaadiram?

1795
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:32,875
Where are they serving the liquor?

1796
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:34,917
Uncle, you can drink
and eat as much as you want,

1797
01:36:34,959 --> 01:36:37,334
but you are forbidden from
going anywhere near the stage.

1798
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:39,417
You see, this is my friend's
first-ever engagement ceremony.

1799
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,125
Mr. XL, XXL! Get to work.

1800
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:48,959
Our guests are crossing limits.

1801
01:36:49,209 --> 01:36:50,625
They are stealing cutlery.

1802
01:36:50,959 --> 01:36:51,959
Take care.

1803
01:36:55,834 --> 01:36:56,959
Hello, Rejected Mom.

1804
01:36:57,542 --> 01:36:59,250
You are responsible for this table.

1805
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:01,167
Make sure no one
moves from their place.

1806
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:02,293
Joking?

1807
01:37:02,334 --> 01:37:03,334
No.

1808
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:05,875
Oh, hi.

1809
01:37:07,334 --> 01:37:11,167
So, this is why you are here?

1810
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:13,750
No, it's Dhruvi's wedding. I'm just
giving my friend a helping hand.

1811
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:15,834
So, who will be
your wife's helping hand?

1812
01:37:16,209 --> 01:37:17,209
Yours truly.

1813
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:18,375
Really.

1814
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:20,209
You see, they have organised
a musical night for tomorrow.

1815
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,250
-Okay.
-So I want to dance.

1816
01:37:22,334 --> 01:37:24,334
-Okay.
-With you.

1817
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:25,625
No way.

1818
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:26,750
For real?

1819
01:37:26,959 --> 01:37:28,292
Yes. For real.

1820
01:37:28,917 --> 01:37:31,459
This is your last chance
to get into my good books.

1821
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,959
I have already selected the song.

1822
01:37:34,209 --> 01:37:36,959
Make sure you are there
for the rehearsals on time.

1823
01:37:38,959 --> 01:37:39,959
Okay, Tara.

1824
01:37:40,334 --> 01:37:41,959
Go Tara!

1825
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:05,334
<i>"My house has been decorated
My love too has decked up"</i>

1826
01:38:05,459 --> 01:38:11,375
<i>"My house has been decorated
My love too has decked up"</i>

1827
01:38:12,959 --> 01:38:18,375
<i>"For you..."</i>

1828
01:38:18,667 --> 01:38:24,667
<i>"For you
I have henna on my hands"</i>

1829
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,500

1830
01:38:31,917 --> 01:38:38,292

1831
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:44,042
<i>"Like a flock of birds..."</i>

1832
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:50,375
<i>"Today I fly away from my nest"</i>

1833
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:55,459
<i>"Leaving a few memories behind
I move on with the rest"</i>

1834
01:38:55,584 --> 01:38:58,667
<i>"My house has been decorated
My love too has decked up"</i>

1835
01:38:58,834 --> 01:39:01,000
Brother-in-law,
you can let go off her hand now.

1836
01:39:01,084 --> 01:39:02,750
No.

1837
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:04,917
Never let go off her hand.

1838
01:39:05,084 --> 01:39:06,209
He is my son.

1839
01:39:06,334 --> 01:39:08,750
He will never let go off her hand
or her.

1840
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:28,917
<i>"You are my destiny"</i>

1841
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,084

01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:39,834

1843
01:39:40,459 --> 01:39:45,584
<i>"I will always treasure your heart"</i>

01:39:50,834 --> 01:39:56,542
<i>"What a day this is!"</i>

1845
01:39:56,750 --> 01:40:02,875
<i>"This is such an auspicious day!"</i>

1846
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:12,834
<i>"For my wishes"</i>

1847
01:40:12,959 --> 01:40:18,959

01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,625
<i>"My house has been decorated

1852
01:41:09,834 --> 01:41:10,875
Purshottam.

1853
01:41:11,042 --> 01:41:12,125
Hurry up.

1854
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:13,875
It's time for our performance.

1855
01:41:13,959 --> 01:41:15,084
Come on, hurry up.

1856
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,250
It's time for our show.

1857
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:20,125
I hope you are ready.

1858
01:41:20,459 --> 01:41:21,542
Deepti...

1859
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:23,959
Hurry up.
Open the door.

1860
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:25,625
Go away, Deepti.

1861
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:28,625
What?

1862
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:31,334
You should leave, please.

1863
01:41:31,959 --> 01:41:33,084
What's wrong?

1864
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:34,959
What are you saying?

1865
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,667
Are you backing down
from your word again?

1866
01:41:36,959 --> 01:41:38,334
Open the door.

1867
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:42,125
Deepti, I... I cannot do this.

1868
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:44,959
What can you not do?

1869
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:46,125
Deepti...

1870
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:49,959
What's wrong, Purshottam?
Please open the door.

1871
01:41:50,084 --> 01:41:51,875
I am a coward.

1872
01:41:54,459 --> 01:41:56,875
I left you alone at the station.

1873
01:41:58,542 --> 01:42:01,084
I didn't have the courage
to support you.

1874
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:06,292
I wish I had listened to you.

1875
01:42:10,292 --> 01:42:13,167
You are still not listening to me,
Purshottam.

1876
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,000
It's of no use now.

1877
01:42:15,375 --> 01:42:17,625
I spent all my life without you.

1878
01:42:24,375 --> 01:42:27,084
I too have a picture of you,
which I treasure, you know.

1879
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:32,875
You aren't the only one
who remembers everything.

1880
01:42:35,625 --> 01:42:40,167
I have kept your picture
in my college diary.

1881
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:46,417
Really?

1882
01:42:51,584 --> 01:42:54,375
But that relationship
wouldn't have survived.

1883
01:42:56,542 --> 01:42:58,667
We would have been together
at least.

1884
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:02,292
We are together now.

1885
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,459
Really?

1886
01:43:08,084 --> 01:43:11,917
We also have our son and
our daughter-in-law with us now.

1887
01:43:13,167 --> 01:43:15,959
So, why shouldn't we enjoy
each other's company?

1888
01:43:18,417 --> 01:43:21,417
Who doesn't like to dance
at their son's wedding?

1889
01:43:23,917 --> 01:43:27,750
This is our wedding gift to them.

1890
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,292
Will you come with me?

1891
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,584
Don't let go off my hand.

1892
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:44,292
<i>"Please talk to me
Don't ignore me"</i>

1893
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:50,500
<i>"Please talk to me
Don't ignore me"</i>

1894
01:43:51,084 --> 01:43:54,500
<i>"Come here, my love"</i>

1895
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:18,500
<i>"One look is all it takes
Then you are doomed"</i>

1896
01:44:18,584 --> 01:44:23,167
<i>"The story always stays the same
Only the times change"</i>

1897
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:42,500
<i>"Please talk to me
Don't ignore me"</i>

1898
01:44:46,042 --> 01:44:48,084
They danced well.

1899
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:53,417
You look great.
Like the father of the groom.

1900
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:57,084
Don't you think
you should close the buttons?

1901
01:44:57,167 --> 01:44:58,292
Oh, yes.

1902
01:45:01,292 --> 01:45:03,459
Uncle, auntie, are you ready?

1903
01:45:03,542 --> 01:45:04,917
Your performance
is cued next, okay?

1904
01:45:04,959 --> 01:45:05,877
-Okay, okay.
-All the best.

1905
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:06,917
Thanks.

1906
01:45:07,417 --> 01:45:09,500
I hope you remember all the steps.

1907
01:45:10,209 --> 01:45:12,209
Dad, you danced well,

1908
01:45:12,292 --> 01:45:13,959
but watch out for
my parents' performance.

1909
01:45:14,167 --> 01:45:15,376
They will blow your mind away.

1910
01:45:15,959 --> 01:45:18,000
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

1911
01:45:18,084 --> 01:45:19,167
Hello, ma'am.

1912
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:21,292
Let me seek your blessings first.

1913
01:45:21,375 --> 01:45:22,959
God bless you.

1914
01:45:23,459 --> 01:45:26,042
You are amazing.

1915
01:45:26,667 --> 01:45:28,750
How nice of you to decide
to be a mother at this age.

1916
01:45:29,042 --> 01:45:29,709
Fantastic.

1917
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:33,167
Even I, Shaadiram,
cannot provide such lovely parents.

1918
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:35,625
Sir, can I know how much
did you charge for this act?

1919
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:37,542
How much did you charge
for this contract, huh?

1920
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:42,208
Contract? What do you mean?

1921
01:45:42,959 --> 01:45:44,584
Don't act so surprised.

1922
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,417
It will stay between us.
I am in the wedding business.

1923
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,125
I know everything, "Dad."

1924
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:52,875
I know that you aren't
his real father.

1925
01:45:53,042 --> 01:45:55,375
And you are not
Dhruv's real mother.

1926
01:45:55,459 --> 01:45:56,542
I know.

1927
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:02,334
Shaadiram,
please don't create a scene.

1928
01:46:03,125 --> 01:46:04,542
This is important to Dhruv.

1929
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:05,543
Please.

1930
01:46:05,584 --> 01:46:07,584
And my business is important to me.

1931
01:46:07,875 --> 01:46:11,667
You see, sir, I can never let go
of a good business opportunity.

1932
01:46:11,834 --> 01:46:14,167
Moreover, I thought--

1933
01:46:15,334 --> 01:46:18,417
-You little menace.
-Shaadiram.

1934
01:46:18,584 --> 01:46:19,959
Shaadiram, please.

1935
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,334
What's going on?

1936
01:46:22,625 --> 01:46:26,917
Look, we agree that
we aren't Dhruv's real parents.

1937
01:46:27,167 --> 01:46:29,125
But this is important to Dhruv.

1938
01:46:29,209 --> 01:46:30,127
Please.

1939
01:46:30,167 --> 01:46:32,167
And my business is important to me.

1940
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:37,834
Look, I want half of what Dhruv
has paid you to be his fake parents.

1941
01:46:37,917 --> 01:46:41,459
Pay me half
and my lips will remain sealed.

1942
01:46:41,542 --> 01:46:44,959
-But we didn't--
-I run a company called Shaadiram.

1943
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,167
I provide wedding guests
and relatives on lease.

1944
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,834
-You want money? You'll get it.
-Turn it off.

1945
01:46:51,167 --> 01:46:52,376
But not a word to anyone about it.

1946
01:46:52,417 --> 01:46:53,417
Please.

1947
01:46:57,834 --> 01:46:58,834
Shut up!

1948
01:46:59,542 --> 01:47:01,084
You should join my company.

1949
01:47:17,334 --> 01:47:19,000
<i>She became the talk of the town.</i>

1950
01:47:19,084 --> 01:47:19,960
Please sit down.

1951
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,375
<i>"Everyone wanted to know
All the details"</i>

1952
01:47:23,417 --> 01:47:24,584
What was that all about?
Relatives on rent, really?

1953
01:47:24,667 --> 01:47:26,334
-No, it's not--
-No, we just rented the DJ.

1954
01:47:26,667 --> 01:47:28,167
I think it got recorded
during the rehearsal.

1955
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:31,209
<i>"She is young and beautiful"</i>

1956
01:47:31,292 --> 01:47:33,084
<i>"When she dressed up
And left for the market..."</i>

1957
01:47:33,167 --> 01:47:34,167
Look, how well they dance.

1958
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,292
Stop it.

1959
01:47:35,375 --> 01:47:36,917
-Stop it, I say!
-But...

1960
01:47:36,959 --> 01:47:37,959
Stop it!

1961
01:47:38,459 --> 01:47:40,584
But they are dancing so well.

1962
01:47:41,334 --> 01:47:42,417
What is this, Dhruv?

1963
01:47:42,542 --> 01:47:43,625
What's wrong?

1964
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:49,209
It is not so.

1965
01:47:49,917 --> 01:47:51,750
It is a misunderstanding.

1966
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:54,917
Who are you?

1967
01:47:56,334 --> 01:47:58,250
They have already blurted it out.

1968
01:47:58,709 --> 01:48:00,042
Their entire gang is here.

1969
01:48:00,209 --> 01:48:01,292
-Hang on a second.
-This has become a trend these days.

1970
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:02,458
Hang on a second.
Excuse me.

1971
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:07,292
Please get off the stage.

1972
01:48:07,834 --> 01:48:08,834
Come on.

1973
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:27,209
You two aren't married
to each other, right?

1974
01:48:28,959 --> 01:48:30,584
How does it matter?

1975
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,667
They are my parents,
and they always will be.

1976
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,750
Hello!

1977
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:36,750
It matters.

1978
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:38,084
What makes you think
that it doesn't matter?

1979
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:40,459
It matters to my daughter.
It matters to my family.

1980
01:48:40,542 --> 01:48:41,959
It matters to the society.

1981
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:43,959
And most importantly,
it matters to me!

1982
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:51,375
Anya, you are the only one
who matters to me.

1983
01:48:51,917 --> 01:48:53,792
-If I have you, nothing else matters.
-What's the truth, Dhruv?

1984
01:48:56,542 --> 01:48:59,459
They aren't your parents?

1985
01:49:00,959 --> 01:49:02,000
Huh?

1986
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,500
I am an orphan.

1987
01:49:09,959 --> 01:49:11,125
What?

1988
01:49:11,334 --> 01:49:12,709
Orphan?

1989
01:49:18,542 --> 01:49:20,250
-You...
-No...

1990
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:21,875
Stay away... stay away from her.

1991
01:49:21,959 --> 01:49:23,584
-But, sir--
-Shut up. Shut up!

1992
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:26,667
You don't deserve
to talk to my daughter.

1993
01:49:27,167 --> 01:49:28,209
You are a fraud.

1994
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:33,292
You should've found yourself a wife
just like you found yourself fake parents.

1995
01:49:33,709 --> 01:49:35,875
Why are you ruining
my daughter's life?

1996
01:49:39,084 --> 01:49:40,292
I am ruining her life?

1997
01:49:41,084 --> 01:49:42,250
Anya, am I ruining...

1998
01:49:44,542 --> 01:49:46,125
What do you know about my life?

1999
01:49:46,959 --> 01:49:48,042
What do you know about me?

2000
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:52,334
Your society
had decided my fate for me.

2001
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:55,709
This little boy will wash utensils
at an eatery for the rest of his life.

2002
01:49:56,292 --> 01:49:57,625
But I fought for myself.

2003
01:49:58,042 --> 01:50:00,001
I went against my fate.
I went against everyone.

2004
01:50:00,292 --> 01:50:01,959
For better or for worse,
I am a self-made man.

2005
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,209
I have my own start-up.

2006
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,000
I have my own house.

2007
01:50:07,292 --> 01:50:08,625
And you are calling them cheats?

2008
01:50:09,875 --> 01:50:12,959
Do you have any idea what they
have done for all of you, for us?

2009
01:50:16,167 --> 01:50:18,959
Someone from this very society
of yours had given birth to me

2010
01:50:19,042 --> 01:50:20,667
and left me on the streets
to fend for myself.

2011
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:23,625
Then I was told that
I cannot choose my own family.

2012
01:50:24,375 --> 01:50:25,750
Why can't I?

2013
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:28,125
Who made this rule, Anya? I...

2014
01:50:29,959 --> 01:50:31,459
I chose my family.

2015
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:36,125
This man...
Mr. Purshottam, he is my father.

2016
01:50:36,667 --> 01:50:38,459
And Ms. Deepti, she is my mother.

2017
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:42,292
And we are very lucky that
we found each other, Anya.

2018
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
-We are very happy to--
-Then why didn't you tell me?

2019
01:50:45,542 --> 01:50:46,542
Huh?

2020
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:48,875
Didn't I tell you
everything about my life?

2021
01:50:48,959 --> 01:50:50,459
Then why didn't you tell me
the truth?

2022
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:52,292
-I lived with you.
-I know, I know.

2023
01:50:52,417 --> 01:50:54,084
I treated you like a mother.

2024
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:55,917
-She is my mom, Anya.
-It was all a lie, right?

2025
01:50:55,959 --> 01:50:57,000
No, Anya.
It wasn't a lie.

2026
01:50:57,084 --> 01:50:58,959
-I feel like a fool, Dhruv.
-No, Anya. I am--

2027
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:01,959
-Don't touch me! Don't touch me.
-I tried to tell you, but...

2028
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,459
I feared that I might lose you.

2029
01:51:04,542 --> 01:51:05,792
-Don't touch me.
-I know it was a mistake, Anya.

2030
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:09,000
And you created this elaborate
illusion to cover up that mistake.

2031
01:51:09,542 --> 01:51:10,625
You are a fraud.

2032
01:51:10,917 --> 01:51:11,959
This is a scam.

2033
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,042
You are a very strange man.

2034
01:51:15,125 --> 01:51:17,084
-What do you mean?
-Let me say it, Shunty.

2035
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,583
You are a very strange man!

2036
01:51:18,584 --> 01:51:19,584
Dhruv.

2037
01:51:20,334 --> 01:51:22,000
Your demands never end.

2038
01:51:23,584 --> 01:51:24,584
You wanted this circus.

2039
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:26,042
You wanted all the relatives
to attend the wedding.

2040
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:27,959
Happy now?
Enjoy the circus!

2041
01:51:29,584 --> 01:51:31,375
-It's a mess. I wanted a simple--
-Shut up!

2042
01:51:31,459 --> 01:51:32,792
-Anya, I--
-Shut up!

2043
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:35,000
-How dare you talk to my dad like that?
-I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2044
01:51:35,084 --> 01:51:36,209
-Dhruv...
-Anya, listen.

2045
01:51:36,292 --> 01:51:37,917
I don't think I know you.

2046
01:51:37,959 --> 01:51:39,084
-Anya, I am really sorry.
-I don't think I know you.

2047
01:51:39,167 --> 01:51:40,334
-Let's get out of here, Dad.
-No, no, no. Anya, wait.

2048
01:51:40,417 --> 01:51:41,417
-Anya, I'm sorry.
-Stop it, Dhruv.

2049
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:42,667
-Take him away.
-No, Anya. I love you.

2050
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:44,250
-Please, Dhruv.
-Anya, Anya, please.

2051
01:51:44,334 --> 01:51:46,584
-Don't make me hit you, Dhruv.
-I was going to tell you, Anya.

2052
01:51:46,667 --> 01:51:47,250
Dhruv!

2053
01:51:47,334 --> 01:51:48,667
-I am sorry, Anya.
-Let's go, Dad.

2054
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:49,959
I'll call the police!

2055

How can I help you?

2093
01:54:49,334 --> 01:54:54,417
We are not here
to justify ourselves.

2094
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:57,042
-We just wanted to talk.
-You just wanted to talk?

2095
01:54:57,667 --> 01:54:59,125
You still think you can talk to us?

2096
01:54:59,209 --> 01:55:00,375
-Sanjeev? Sanjeev.
-You really think so?

2097
01:55:00,459 --> 01:55:01,459
Ridiculous.

2098
01:55:02,334 --> 01:55:04,500
Please have a seat.

2099
01:55:04,584 --> 01:55:05,584
Why?

2100
01:55:08,834 --> 01:55:10,167
No, thank you.

2101
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:12,000
We are only here to apologise.

2102
01:55:12,084 --> 01:55:17,917
We agree we made a mistake,
but we didn't do anything wrong.

2103
01:55:17,959 --> 01:55:19,292
Please.

2104
01:55:20,417 --> 01:55:22,542
We should have told you, but...

2105
01:55:24,125 --> 01:55:31,667
Every lie was so beautifully turned
into a reality by Anya that we...

2106
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:34,209
Sorry, but...

2107
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:39,959
Please, that house doesn't
feel like home without Anya.

2108
01:55:40,417 --> 01:55:42,375
Dhruv isn't the same
without her either.

2109
01:55:42,459 --> 01:55:43,875
Please, sir.

2110
01:55:44,459 --> 01:55:45,667
For our children's sake.

2111
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:48,417
Well, that was a very nice speech.

2112
01:55:48,667 --> 01:55:49,667
But you should leave now.

2113
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:50,834
Sanjeev.

2114
01:55:53,584 --> 01:55:54,959
Actually...

2115
01:55:55,417 --> 01:56:00,375
Ms. Deepti,
Anya is getting married.

2116
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:03,292
What?

2117
01:56:04,125 --> 01:56:05,209
Yes.

2118
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:06,584
On 12th July.

2119
01:56:10,084 --> 01:56:11,917
-Anya's getting married?
-You are invited.

2120
01:56:12,667 --> 01:56:15,417
The invitation extends
to Dhruv and his family.

2121
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:17,459
What are you doing?

2122
01:56:18,459 --> 01:56:19,542
Give it to them, Kanika.

2123
01:56:20,459 --> 01:56:22,584
Doc, please?

2124
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:27,084
I am going to the clinic.

2125
01:56:28,167 --> 01:56:29,209
Doc?

2126
01:56:35,417 --> 01:56:36,917
Thank you, dear.

2127
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,417
<i>Who asked you to go there?</i>

2128
01:56:44,084 --> 01:56:45,292
Huh?

2129
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:47,459
You are my parents.

2130
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:49,834
No one has the right to insult you.
Got it?

2131
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:51,584
-No, they didn't--
-No, Mom.

2132
01:56:53,667 --> 01:56:55,125
What are you so upset about?

2133
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:56,459
What's wrong?
Did someone die?

2134
01:56:57,459 --> 01:56:59,750
It's over. Forget about it.

2135
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,292
They invited us
for the wedding, right?

2136
01:57:02,959 --> 01:57:04,959
We will go there as a family.
All of us.

2137
01:57:05,417 --> 01:57:10,125
What we did with Anya
wasn't right, son.

2138
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:13,209
We needed to apologise for it.

2139
01:57:20,209 --> 01:57:23,042
Mom, we are together.

2140
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:24,584
It's enough.

2141
01:57:25,042 --> 01:57:26,250
I am making pizza.

2142
01:57:26,959 --> 01:57:28,417
We'll have it together.

2143
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,583
I won't burn it this time.

2144
01:57:30,292 --> 01:57:31,292
Come.

2145
01:57:41,292 --> 01:57:42,292
Strange.

2146
01:57:42,375 --> 01:57:45,334
Why is no one in the mood
to talk today?

2147
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:48,209
Anya is getting married.

2148
01:57:48,292 --> 01:57:50,042
And I hope Dhruv attends it.

2149
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:51,292
With family.

2150
01:57:52,084 --> 01:57:53,209
Kanika, behave.

2151
01:57:53,959 --> 01:57:54,959
Behave?

2152
01:57:55,917 --> 01:57:59,500
I saw how you behaved
with Dhruv's family today.

2153
01:57:59,584 --> 01:58:00,750
Dhruv's family?

2154
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:03,750
They came here?

2155
01:58:05,584 --> 01:58:08,126
-Yes, they did.
-When?

2156
01:58:08,167 --> 01:58:10,750
They are not Dhruv's family, okay?

2157
01:58:10,834 --> 01:58:12,709
What's a family?

2158
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:15,959
Tell me. What is a family?

2159
01:58:16,209 --> 01:58:19,542
Like we all are here, sitting
together, sharing the same surname.

2160
01:58:19,709 --> 01:58:22,334
So, we are a family
and they are not a family.

2161
01:58:22,459 --> 01:58:23,709
-Right?
-Right!

2162
01:58:25,042 --> 01:58:26,209
Surname matters.

2163
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:28,084
It forms a relation.

2164
01:58:28,417 --> 01:58:31,917
You cannot just pick a stranger
and make them a relative.

2165
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:33,750
Oh.

2166
01:58:34,084 --> 01:58:35,167
Okay.

2167
01:58:35,917 --> 01:58:38,959
Then, Dad, your sister
isn't a stranger, is she?

2168
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:41,084
She is a part of our family.

2169
01:58:41,959 --> 01:58:43,750
Then why do we treat her like this?

2170
01:58:44,334 --> 01:58:46,834
Why do you get so irritated
with Chintu?

2171
01:58:47,292 --> 01:58:50,959
Just because she married Anya's tutor
instead of a boy of your choice?

2172
01:58:51,042 --> 01:58:52,334
Kanika, enough.

2173
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:54,292
Mom, please.

2174
01:59:07,375 --> 01:59:08,459
Why were they here?

2175
01:59:09,792 --> 01:59:11,417
They were here for you.

2176
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:21,042
Anya, please, I think
you should give this a thought.

2177
01:59:21,917 --> 01:59:25,500
Do you want a ready-made, superficial
family with the same surname?

2178
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:32,084
Or the family that Dhruv has made,
just for you?

2179
01:59:51,209 --> 01:59:53,375
I know, Anya, you love kids.

2180
01:59:54,292 --> 01:59:55,459
But I hate them.

2181
01:59:56,584 --> 01:59:57,875
I don't want them.

2182
01:59:58,917 --> 02:00:00,500
I hated myself as a kid.

2183
02:00:01,959 --> 02:00:05,292
Apart from that, I'll give you
everything you ask for.

2184
02:00:08,417 --> 02:00:09,750
I am going to be your husband.

2185
02:00:09,959 --> 02:00:11,084
It's my duty.

2186
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:14,959
And I know what girls want
the most these days.

2187
02:00:15,584 --> 02:00:16,792
Privacy.

2188
02:00:17,917 --> 02:00:22,125
That's why we'll move to Canada
after the wedding.

2189
02:00:22,834 --> 02:00:24,000
And guess what?

2190
02:00:24,167 --> 02:00:26,167
I have already applied for PR.

2191
02:00:27,084 --> 02:00:28,334
We'll be able to live
our lives on our own terms there.

2192
02:00:28,417 --> 02:00:29,459
We'll have privacy.

2193
02:00:30,709 --> 02:00:34,959
It was tough, but I convinced
my parents only for you.

2194
02:00:36,084 --> 02:00:40,042
I'm gifting them a luxurious
senior citizen home in Faridabad.

2195
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:45,250
Take a right.

2196
02:00:46,125 --> 02:00:47,334
What made you change the plan?

2197
02:00:47,375 --> 02:00:48,500
Just take a right.

2198
02:00:48,959 --> 02:00:50,042
Okay, baby, anything for you.

2199
02:00:50,125 --> 02:00:51,792
Concentrate on driving!
Take a right.

2200
02:00:51,875 --> 02:00:53,084
Okay, relax.

2201
02:00:59,834 --> 02:01:00,834
Stop, stop, stop.

2202
02:01:13,459 --> 02:01:14,459
Hi, sir.

2203
02:01:14,459 --> 02:01:15,709
Meet Sanket Ahuja.

2204
02:01:15,917 --> 02:01:17,250
I am getting married to him.

2205
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,667
And, Sanket, meet Goga
the great magician.

2206
02:01:21,042 --> 02:01:22,042
Hi.

2207
02:01:25,292 --> 02:01:28,209
He's going to show you
his best magic trick.

2208
02:01:28,292 --> 02:01:29,334
-Right?
-How nice.

2209
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,250
Close your eyes.

2210
02:01:33,042 --> 02:01:34,042
Take a deep breath.

2211
02:01:34,917 --> 02:01:35,917
Deeper.

2212
02:01:36,084 --> 02:01:37,209
Anya.

2213
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:39,584
What are you doing?

2214
02:01:41,209 --> 02:01:42,667
What kind of a person are you?

2215
02:01:43,542 --> 02:01:45,334
You moved mountains for me.

2216
02:01:45,417 --> 02:01:46,875
And now when I am about
to marry this clown,

2217
02:01:46,959 --> 02:01:48,042
you plan to do nothing about it?

2218
02:01:48,125 --> 02:01:49,125
What?

2219
02:01:49,417 --> 02:01:51,042
-What are you talking about?
-One second.

2220
02:01:52,334 --> 02:01:54,625
Kids, uncle has a lot
of chocolates in his pockets.

2221
02:01:54,709 --> 02:01:56,543
-Go and grab them!
-I don't have any chocolates.

2222
02:01:56,584 --> 02:02:00,334
Uncle, chocolate. Uncle, chocolate.

2223
02:02:04,459 --> 02:02:05,625
I love you, Dhruv.

2224
02:02:10,375 --> 02:02:11,542
Will you marry me?

2225
02:02:15,084 --> 02:02:16,084
Please?

2226
02:02:19,292 --> 02:02:20,834
Yes.

2227
02:02:22,542 --> 02:02:23,917
-Then let's run!
-Anya!

2228
02:02:23,959 --> 02:02:25,459
You cannot leave me!

2229
02:02:25,542 --> 02:02:27,542
We have already sent out
invitations for the wedding.

2230
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:28,750
-You--
-Let me handle this.

2231
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:30,500
You bonehead,

2232
02:02:30,542 --> 02:02:33,334
think about what will happen to
your parents when you leave them.

2233
02:02:33,417 --> 02:02:34,417
What will happen?

2234
02:02:35,334 --> 02:02:36,210
Think about it.

2235
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:37,750
-Uncle, please!
-I don't have any chocolates!

2236
02:02:37,834 --> 02:02:40,000
You want chocolates, huh?
Take this! Take the chocolates!

2237
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,167
You both have come alone?

2238
02:03:16,875 --> 02:03:17,959
Where's your family?

2239
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:28,917
<i>"Go for it!"</i>

2240
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,292
<i>"Go for it!"</i>

2241
02:03:30,959 --> 02:03:36,250
<i>"Everyone had a blast
When Mother went crazy"</i>

2242
02:03:36,334 --> 02:03:41,625
<i>"Everyone had a blast
When Mother went crazy"</i>

2243
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:47,584
<i>"We plan to stay high all night
The wedding guests were left shocked"</i>

2244
02:04:02,125 --> 02:04:03,043
Dhruvi!

2245
02:04:03,084 --> 02:04:06,500
-Where have you been!
-I'd gone to get a dog for you.

2246
02:04:06,584 --> 02:04:07,959
So cute!

2247
02:04:08,042 --> 02:04:09,834
I adopted a dog too.

2248
02:04:12,709 --> 02:04:14,417
Smile, please!

2249
02:04:45,292 --> 02:04:49,959
<i>"Keep a watch on the path that
I walked as you follow me"</i>

2250
02:04:50,042 --> 02:04:54,667
<i>"Don't forget
To get my sandals along"</i>

2251
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:59,375
<i>"We are not going to get engaged
My love"</i>

2252
02:04:59,459 --> 02:05:03,250
<i>There is no way
We are going to get engaged"</i>

2253
02:05:03,334 --> 02:05:08,084
<i>"I'll follow you everywhere
In a Lambo"</i>

2254
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:12,792
<i>"Break the barriers
And come downstairs"</i>

2255
02:05:12,875 --> 02:05:17,792
<i>"My heart beats to the tune
Of a flute just for you"</i>

2256
02:05:18,209 --> 02:05:20,584
<i>-"Beats to the tune of a flute"
-"Play it"</i>

2257
02:05:23,917 --> 02:05:29,917
<i>-"Get down, baby."
-"I am feeling very, very shy..."</i>

2258
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,834
<i>"I am feeling very, very shy..."</i>

2259
02:05:32,917 --> 02:05:38,834
