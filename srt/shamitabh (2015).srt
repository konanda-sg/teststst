Such a stom that comes once or twice every
30-40years.

00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:08,134
But when it comes, it changes the direction of

Leave 6 packs, he doesn't have a 1 pack body. No height,

12
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:23,125

All I know is this industry has benifited from
Shamitab!

17
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,851
Few days back, know one knew him his name

18
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:45,551
Today, everyone has only one word to say,

19
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:49,246
Mr Sunil
Shamitab Rocks!

20
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:50,625
Mr Boney, Mr Boney!

21
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,969
When seeing the 1st scene of the movie, i told my wife,
This boy will set the stage on fire.

22
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,158
What a voice! What intensity!

23
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:20,626
Namaskar! I am Shamitabh speaking.

You all have been searching for me, and I have been
waiting for all here.

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,547
Its seems this time my voiceis trying to create problems.

27
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,954
Hi! Hello! & Namaskar! Wishing a good day.

28
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:37,358
Thanking you for liking Lifebouy so much.

29
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:45,478
An artist is just a medium. A directors thought,
and a writers word, to be put across to the public.

30
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:52,684
Generally, Directors dont go to gym, writer doesnt
shave. And a camera doesn't like it.

31
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:54,116
Thanks

32
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,701
Or else an artist like me, would never get
any work.

33
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,601
Ladies and gentlemens. The creater of Lifebouy.

34
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:13,981
Namaskar!

35
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:18,947
If you had wanted, you could have got any big star,
then why bring in a new face?

36
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:22,498
Every big star, at 1st is a new face.

37
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:28,630
One more question sir. Shamitabh sir. Shamitabh sir.
Sir, Sir!

38
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:30,918
Have you got your news?

00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:35,791

presnted me a Knighthood.

40
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:37,032
What!

41
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:42,655
Sir Anthony Hoppkins, Sir Richard Attenborough,
Sir Elton John.

42
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:47,770
We call them sir. I am far away from getting Knighthood.

43
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,614
Then why are you all calling me Sir?

44
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,969
Sir

45
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,037
Sir one question... Yes

46
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:03,535
Sir... Sorry... You had been kept away from the promotion
of the film. Why?

47
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:08,667
My director and producers say. The thing that comes free
is not valued.

48
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:12,410
Spending money and watching on screen.
The fun is all diffrent in it..

49
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:14,151
Sir, Sir!

50
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:17,309
Mumbai is the capital of film industry, and of
Maharashtra also.

51
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:21,851
Then why did it take a Marathi person so
much time to become a superstar... May I.

52
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:30,860
Go as the film industry. Why were the so late
in searching me?

53
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:36,005
Go ask the world, why were the late in listening to my voice?

54
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,460
Go ask my dreams, why it so long to become a
reality?

55
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:46,392
After that... After than

56
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:50,229
So children tell me, who this is?

57
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,912
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

58
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:58,804
Who is Gandhi ji? Father of the nation.

59
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:01,840
Yes.

60
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:06,022
What did we get because of him?
Our Independence.

61
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,116
Danish... What are you doing?

62
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:21,977
If you cant speak, that doesnt mean you would
be left alone. Write on board and convey. Get up.

63
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:27,716
No one will give the answer.
Who was Gandhi ji's wife?

64
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,613
Kasturba Gandhi... No answers please!

65
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,914
Rohini Hatangadi

66
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,428
Not coming to school. Watching movies day night

67
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:49,968
Got no father, and cant speak, out of pitty
got you admitted to the school.

68
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,192
Thought, atleast you will learn something by atleast listening.
What will become by watching movies? Hero?

69
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:03,233
Really... You will become a hero?
Then show your Herism.

70
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,548
You didn't learn anything from the teacher.
Lets see what you learned from movies.

71
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:13,218
What?... The age of silent movies is past now.

72
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:18,099
Whats the scene?

73
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:25,956

You have killed my mother... Sir.
Sir... You have killed my mother.

77
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:04,725
Is he mad? What is he saying?

78
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:11,323
Go back, I am asking you to stop.
I am telling you to stop.

79
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:22,170
Hey, hey, leave him, leave him...
Leave him

80
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,932
Sir. I won't let you live.

81
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,384
How will you become a hero?

82
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:13,384
Hey, you can shake the whole world without saying.

But which heroine will work with a
hero of you size.. Tell Me?

00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:47,470
Nothing has happend to me. I will keep coming

00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:53,498
Why?.. Because, if I don't act as if I am sick. He
will run away to  Mumbai. To become an actor.

86
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:18,832
This time I have to really give you medicines.
You are getting really sick.

87
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,625
You need to take rest, how many more days

88
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:25,888
If stop working, then he will take responsibility.
Then his dream to go Mumbai will be dashed.

89
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:33,023
No.. No.

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:34,788

You are not from film celebrity family. And have

104
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:12,098
A person whose fate is 5.2 inchs, and 51kgs.

00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:46,321
What I have is something like a mobile phone blutooth device.

165
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:57,067
Where ever you are in 400 metre radius, even if its
sound proof, or mobile proof area.

166
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:02,271
People talking to you, and all sound from around
you, can be heard by me.

167
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:08,102
And whatever I say, you can hear if from
me clear without any outside disturbances.

168
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:13,187
And the same sound would be received by the voice
processor implanted in you.

169
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:22,392
And that voice processor has got a motion sensor.
When you move your lips. Motion sensor will detect it.

170
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:30,617
And that voice, that your voice processor has received
will come out of your mouth, through...

171
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,516
a high fidelity speaker... and very clear.

172
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:36,248
Today I can give you a live voice.

173
00:29:50,012 --> 00:29:54,060
Chill.. By listening to voice.. syncing lip
movment is an art.

174
00:29:56,353 --> 00:30:00,483
Chill.. With voice, syncing lips is an art.

175
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:07,810
If dont want to speak, while listening to voice,
dont open your mouth. Just shut up.

176
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,460
And, if you dont speak for some time, the voice
stored in your processor is automatically erased.

177
00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:19,930
Now all you need is a good voice. Someone with whom you
can work out a good understanding.

178
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:07,420
My friend hero.. You got Talent.. Technology..
Tantrum.. But who has got your voice, my friend.

179
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:17,437
I have. I have a bottle.. a glass.. Water.. Thirst
Sancks.. Chicken..

180
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,019
But who has my liquor, my friend?

181
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:34,438
People have become fan of your voice.
Do you feel your voice was reason of your success?

182
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:37,265
No.. No..

183
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,254
I look good. Why?

184
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,916
My face should give you a inferiority complex.

185
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:54,264
You people from media can make a person feel
his hatred between his face and voice.

186
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:03,423
We have spoken a lot now.. Its time to party.
My throat has gone dry.

187
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:20,614
Hey, hello. I am going to urinate, so don't open your mouth.

188
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:24,679
Or you will change the meaning of no. 1
in bollywood.

189
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,018
Who is got my liquor, my friend?

190
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:41,974
Can we talk to you for 2 minutes?

191
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,189
Get some tea at my table.

192
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:08,007
Both you boys want to drink tea?

193
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:17,475
3 tea please... Ok

194
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:31,000
Do you bury dead bodies here?
No, I don't have licence for it.

195
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:38,353
There... Is my landlord... Who makes a person
from land to reach his lord.

196
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:40,131
I am his paying guest.

197
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:46,143
In Mumbai, where do you get a house for Rs. 500
a month, with such big garden?

198
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,443
Don't you get scared here?

199
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,157
Where people die, people get scared.
No dies in a cemetery.

200
00:34:56,837 --> 00:35:00,327
Scared and dead come here.

201
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,221
You shoudbe scared outside.. outside.

202
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:21,584
Can we not sit some where else?
Why what is the problem sitting here?

203
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:24,346
Oh nothing, but its someones grave.

204
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:41,825
Are you dumb?

205
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:55,651
What is this?

206
00:35:57,269 --> 00:35:58,228
What?

207
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:02,558
The thing we are going to tell you,
it is .

208
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:08,635
So before yo listen, you have to sign the agreement
that you are.. 1 minute.. 1 minute.

209
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:17,029
You want to talk to me... Yes... And to listen to
you talking I have to sign an agreement!... Yes

210
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:20,316
Did you understant anything?

211
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:25,026
Ok I dont want listen to anything.. No Listen..
No sign..

212
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:31,977
What the hell are you doing!
What the hell are you doing!

213
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:46,648
Wants to become an Actor.. If he becomes a
superstar, this is for safety.

214
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:55,024
Your vocie from his mooth sonds good?
This voice will sound good, even from a dogs mouth.

215
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:58,613
Sign over.. Now say..

216
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:03,751
The thing you have in your ears, is in his ears too.
Who ever talks to him, you can hear.

217
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,075
And when you reply, it will be heard from his voice...

218
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:24,755
(speaking a dialogue)

219
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:30,753
What happend?

220
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:35,182
Technolgy does't like the dialogue from
<i>Mughal-E-Azam</i>

221
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:39,507
No chance at all.

222
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:52,857
(Speaking a dialogue)

223
00:37:58,991 --> 00:37:59,950
What happend?

224
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:04,335
Technolgy does't like the dialogue from
<i>Mughal-E-Azam</i>

225
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,994
No chance at all.

226
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:21,717
Jahanpanah.. You voice is coming from inside him...
Looks like he has eaten your mobile phone.

227
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:24,872
So, what is you name?
Amithabh.

228
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:31,080
Mr Amitabh Sinha... So Mr Amitabh.
Would like to become his voice?

229
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:40,278
What is your weight?.. 54.

230
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:42,123
59.

231
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:45,438
The weight of my voice is more than that.

232
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:50,378
Thats the beauty, heavy voice on your body is normal.

233
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:55,662
But it will stand out on his body, and people will
become fan of your voice.

234
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:45,131
40 years earlier.. I had come to Mumbai to
become a hero... What?

235
00:39:48,742 --> 00:39:50,136
To become a hero.

236
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:58,766
Studio to studio. Studio to studio.

237
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:03,524
No only studio, even radio rejected me.

238
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:08,301
Because of this voice.

239
00:40:09,642 --> 00:40:14,634
For heroes role.. I looked like a villan.

240
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:29,417
My voice was too soft for a villans role.
Here had is voice, and this voice made me a zero.

241
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:34,033
And with that voice, and your face you
want to be a hero.

242
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:42,292
For now he is its a charity case, but whatever he
earns, you will gwt a share of it.

243
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,678
5%

244
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:52,421
OK. 7%.

245
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,877
10%.. Last final offer.

246
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:06,029
Ok 15%.. Come on.. Thats...
Don't throw peanuts at me.. Don't throw peanuts at me..

247
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:13,079
I am watching a movie.. a movie.. Like..

248
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,129
Like the people from the big movie industry.

249
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:25,717
Because of this voice they threw me out.

250
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:33,448
And I am making the same big people from the
industry into a CA.

251
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:44,931
I like it.. I like it..

252
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,230
Akshara.

253
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,979


254
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:08,628
Sir, what is the story?

255
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:27,565
Are both tring to make a movie own your own?
No.. No.. This is a test.

256
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:32,122
We need something to show to the people.
Come here..

257
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:34,370
What is it?.. A small scene

258
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,391
The name is Lifebouy.. Work is..

259
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,904
Is this a scene or a soap?

260
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:14,010
Her directors, next films story, the hero beats up the
dirt(corrupted people), to clean up the country.

261
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:23,248
Yesterday I was taking bath with Lifebouy soap.
I had an Idea. Even so soap helps clean the dirt.

262
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:31,324
Then why not have a hero with name Lifebouy...
Lifebouy.. A boy who gives the country a new life.

263
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:37,454
Will beat him.. And walk away in slow motion...
A sound track will play.

264
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:47,486
(Singing lifebuoy jingle)

265
00:43:48,343 --> 00:43:52,835
Now we have to make such an audtion..
Seeing which our director.

266
00:43:52,842 --> 00:44:00,093
..who wants to cast Hrithik and Ranveer would
delete their numbers from his phone itself!

267
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:11,142
Can you hear his voice?.. If you were to reduce your
Drinking.. Concentrate.. Then anyone can hear him.

268
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:24,790
1 minute.. Ahh!

269
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,292
You will have to go a little aback.

270
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:35,895
Or the voice would sound twice.

271
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:48,889
Hello.. Hello.. Name is Lifebouy.
Work is to protcect  the country, and increasing its strength.

272
00:44:57,804 --> 00:45:02,253
Hey, now because of your face I will
have to soften my voice?

273
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:11,876
Hello.. Hello.. Name is Lifebouy.
Work is to protect the country, and increasing its strength.

274
00:45:11,953 --> 00:45:14,613
Hey you.. Have you come to take a stroll in the garden?

275
00:45:20,649 --> 00:45:26,139
Subtitle.. Subtitle.. Now because of your voice,
do I have show only one expression my whole life time?

276
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,581
This can't be done.. He doesn't need a voice,
but needs a different face..

277
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,803
Have I seen you before.. It wont match..
His face and my voice.

278
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,071
Name is Lifebouy. Name is Lifebouy.

279
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:51,329
Work is to protect the country, and increasing its strength.

280
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:54,411
Now he is learning some acting.. Or else..

281
00:45:54,649 --> 00:46:00,773
Name is Lifebouy. Work is to protect the country.

282
00:46:01,113 --> 00:46:03,798
Now he is learning some acting.. Or else..

283
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:08,796
(repeats the dialogue)

284
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:14,167
Jahanpanah.. He's good.. Now days in films..
Actors talk in such casual manner. Isn't it?

285
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:19,255
No, the before act was also good.

286
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,179
 Sir I have shot something, according to your concept.
Just for fun sir... Show me?

287
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:33,091
Isn't this that dumb guy?.. No sir.. He's a very
big actor. He was testing me by acting dumb.

288
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:36,405
Is it?

289
00:46:57,973 --> 00:46:58,932
What an actor.

290
00:47:01,663 --> 00:47:02,622
And Lifebouy.

291
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:09,743
What an Idea.. It your idea itself sir..
No.. No.. What is the interpretation.

292
00:47:09,905 --> 00:47:14,572
Actually bang on title for my film...
I want to meet this..

293
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:19,521
This Danish... Hi. Hi. Danish..
Hey get the test... Ahh.

294
00:47:19,918 --> 00:47:22,003
Read, Read, take it slow.. Come here..
Is thec amera set up ready?

295
00:47:22,037 --> 00:47:22,996
Yes sir. Its ready.

296
00:47:47,854 --> 00:47:51,173
After sucking out people blood, you health
has worsened.

297
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:14,977
Now we have to get a role for you as well.
But at 1st we will have to get some closthes for you.

298
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:19,818
Why? From the time I have seen you in only
one black T shirt.

299
00:48:25,908 --> 00:48:28,749
Yes.. For you a role.. What role?

300
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:35,999
When the shooting is going on. How would be close by
withouting creating a doubt on others around to give voice over.

301
00:48:36,693 --> 00:48:37,652
Manager.

302
00:48:38,074 --> 00:48:41,924
But manager will have to talk to
other people. If the manager and

303
00:48:41,947 --> 00:48:45,971
star talking in same voice, the
whole film intustry will be shaken.

304
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:49,053
And who all will be around the star?

305
00:48:49,647 --> 00:48:51,980
Vallet! We call peons, vallet here

306
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:56,860
 Perfect role.. Name.. Think!

307
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:57,978
Robert?

308
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,698
Stop the car.Stop!

309
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:13,617
Those big film industry people, for my this voice.

310
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:16,229
They pushed you and threw you out.

311
00:49:16,645 --> 00:49:21,804
And I made those big people to act up as a CA
by using my voice.

312
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:24,315
Cant you even do this much?

313
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:38,106
Whisky.. Black.

314
00:49:38,572 --> 00:49:39,531
Here.

315
00:49:40,734 --> 00:49:42,866
 You have money? So pay.

316
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:48,078
You need to control on yor drinking.
Am I drinking?

317
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,689
- I never drink inside the cemetery.
- But you drink inside your 500 ruppee bunglow.

318
00:49:53,144 --> 00:50:00,507
Well thats outside the are of cemetery.
I respect the dead,not the living.

319
00:50:01,847 --> 00:50:06,625
If whisky drinking is stopped, my liver
will have a heart attack due to shock.

320
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:09,662
So no whisky, is very risky

321
00:50:15,157 --> 00:50:21,224
Akshara.. I am removing Danish
from this film.

322
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:36,434
Danish, I have thought about it a lot.

323
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:41,880
I know Danish, you will be very hurt.
I am sorry.

324
00:50:42,225 --> 00:50:45,376
Its all for the success film.
We have change it.

325
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:54,024
You .. Will have to change your name.
(Laughing)

326
00:50:57,761 --> 00:51:01,221
What did you think, its only you who knows
acting.

327
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:03,971
This is not good for our strength

328
00:51:09,946 --> 00:51:14,741
I dont have a problem with all these. But my producers
belive in numerolgy

329
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:22,730
But, name Danish isn't as strong, as you
voice is.

330
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:30,265
He is correct.. Amitabh..Power..
Danish.. Is week.

331
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:50,179
Hey kiddo, We are thinking a name for you,
What do you want?

332
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:17,452
SHAMITABH...

333
00:52:24,661 --> 00:52:27,304
Yes.. Shamitab!

334
00:52:31,723 --> 00:52:37,854
You only used SH. From your name. Why?

335
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:19,491
I have come here on  behalf of BMC,
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

336
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:22,956
We got information that,4 homeless girls..

337
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,029
Hey what are you doing here. You are in frame. Move!
Oh, sorry madam.

338
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,530
(background soundtrack playing)

339
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:30,252
I have come here on  behalf of BMC,
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

340
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:36,919
We got information that,4 homeless dogs, are bothering
people here.

341
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:41,705
The number of injection you get after a dog bite.
That many bullets I will inject into you.

342
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:49,046
Enough, this is thought I am scared of..  In this world
we can kill a human, but not an animal.

343
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:52,703
Cruelty to animal case would be made, and I
would be put into jail.. So thats why..

344
00:54:53,077 --> 00:54:56,414
We.. Don't kill homeless dogs.

345
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,914
They are caught with
nets, put into van.

346
00:55:00,938 --> 00:55:06,154
Taken to hospital, then sterilised, and left back
on streets.

347
00:55:06,446 --> 00:55:10,167
So that one day, they die in peace.

348
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:11,714
Then you can die too!

349
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:20,194
(background soundtrack playing)

350
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,333
I forgot to get dog catching net today!

351
00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:15,327
The peon.

352
00:59:10,176 --> 00:59:13,596
You are great Jahanpanah. End title.

353
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,184
And that Danish.

354
00:59:20,815 --> 00:59:23,871
Introducing Shamitabh

355
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:33,333
I wonted to make fool out of other people.
But I made a fool of myself.

356
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:36,248
A peon.

357
00:59:38,502 --> 00:59:42,076
I can feel the sadness in your heart,
Jahanpanah.

358
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:57,875
Scotch... me..

359
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:02,620
Water.

360
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:04,391
Mixing.

361
01:00:13,283 --> 01:00:17,676
How to get high...
Is there such water.

362
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:24,728
That gives you high without whisky... Is there?
Is there?

363
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,892
And whisky gets you high without water.

364
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:36,002
Whisky.

365
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:39,870
Water.

366
01:00:40,425 --> 01:00:41,927
Needs whisky.

367
01:00:44,569 --> 01:00:47,919
Whisky doesn't need anything.

368
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:31,830
Setting! These people has set the awards!
Because of their reach in industry!

369
01:01:31,972 --> 01:01:33,492
Keep it down.

370
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:40,788
Aamir Khan does it right, boycott such events.
They are all frauds!

371
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:45,530
This is all done to increase the TRP, they calls stars
to give out awards. Its all game of money.

372
01:01:47,295 --> 01:01:52,630
Till the time people see such awards show, it willl keep
going on! Bloddy corruption!

373
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,909
If a movie is made on Anna Hazzare. For him too,
they will have to buy an award!

374
01:03:39,451 --> 01:03:41,113
You were the best heroine.

375
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:44,092
Real.

376
01:03:47,587 --> 01:03:52,579
But.. You won't get any award.

377
01:03:57,706 --> 01:04:01,530
Because real heroes are not given any award.

378
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:28,022
Bandra's increasing population.

379
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:39,372
You sacrafized your 1 BHK flat and you
came here to settle undergound.

380
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,451
You are the real hero.

381
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:48,293
But you want get any award.

382
01:04:56,061 --> 01:05:04,177
No one will understand.

383
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:14,509
Only a person who makes scarifice, can understood
other person who gave scarifices themselves.

384
01:05:29,556 --> 01:05:30,956
You can hear right?

385
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:43,506
When people clap for you then... Lord
It can be heard in paradise.

386
01:05:44,093 --> 01:05:45,396
Upstairs.

387
01:05:49,498 --> 01:05:50,814
You are also dumb.

388
01:05:55,442 --> 01:06:08,031
But you understand... you understand... you understand.

389
01:06:11,057 --> 01:06:15,021
Bewani Sir... Its a very good script...
But.

390
01:06:15,256 --> 01:06:19,788
Clint Eastwood.. Has already made this.. Fantastic film.
In the line of fire.

391
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,599
We have the rights for it sir..
Hey u dumba** who gave you rights?

392
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:35,787
Sir, I am getting the action director of
Mission Impossible.

393
01:06:36,084 --> 01:06:40,974
Why don't you launch yor son in this film?
He looks like a star... Thank you sir.

394
01:06:41,948 --> 01:06:48,559
Actualy in Lifebou, was an action film, but in this
film it should be different.. I want to do romantic.

395
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:08,471
I want do films, which releases in such festival.

396
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:31,081
But for this role....

397
01:08:01,363 --> 01:08:03,853
I can decide, what I role I can do!

398
01:08:03,877 --> 01:08:09,210
I can think for myself.And what I think
will happen. Just say what I want!

399
01:08:14,899 --> 01:08:17,180
I can hear my own vocie.

400
01:08:21,086 --> 01:08:23,290
Even I should like the script.

401
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,282
Even I have to do acting.

402
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:31,919
I am also an artist.

403
01:08:34,841 --> 01:08:39,112
Shamitabh.. I am also Shamitabh.

404
01:09:10,752 --> 01:09:12,773
When are we starting with the film..
Shamitabh.

405
01:09:29,205 --> 01:09:31,296
Finish it before I come back.

406
01:09:40,691 --> 01:09:42,417
I have done lots of here and there.

407
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:47,036
I have to write now.

408
01:09:58,747 --> 01:09:59,744
You are doing it right.

409
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,809
The world

410
01:10:02,353 --> 01:10:03,823
and your co-superstars.

411
01:10:19,741 --> 01:10:21,313
You like the script, but he doesn't?

412
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:24,606
If you are finding it hard to keep one star happy.

413
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:28,015
Then how to convince to stars for just one role.

414
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:44,735
You want to become super duper star! Then what about others.
They also have teir ambitions!

415
01:10:47,187 --> 01:10:48,690
Even I want to make a film.

416
01:10:56,661 --> 01:10:57,939
Will you do my film?

417
01:11:02,232 --> 01:11:04,635
Ofcourse, you will do.. I hav done
so much favour for you.

418
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,083
You have to atleast live till time you do my film...
After that who cares.

419
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,156
I know we will have to do confidentiality agreement
signed him also.

420
01:11:33,074 --> 01:11:34,545
People look thin blacks.

421
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,822
I have gone a little fat?

422
01:11:47,218 --> 01:11:48,681
Don't look at me like that.

423
01:11:54,547 --> 01:11:58,274
I won't fall for your intoxicated eyes, like
your other others fan do.

424
01:12:00,095 --> 01:12:01,910
You like a monkey.

425
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:06,260
But I don't even have time enough to continue this
scene, with my eyes closed.

426
01:12:08,076 --> 01:12:10,716
Concentrate on you work, and let me also do so.

427
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:21,673
I am an Artist!

428
01:12:41,633 --> 01:12:43,998
You should be ashamed.

429
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:47,227
Your name is also copied from hollywood.

430
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:52,228
I should rather say inspired.

431
01:12:55,616 --> 01:12:58,997
What fate, what fate I have got.

432
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:06,011
Couldn't even think of an original name for himself.
How will he make a original film then? Huh?

433
01:13:13,205 --> 01:13:17,993
I am saying it too fast.. I will say it slow.
When..

434
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:24,333
Because of my audio, that video works.

435
01:13:25,942 --> 01:13:28,180
How can you call it a picture then?

436
01:13:28,436 --> 01:13:31,139
No.. Its something to think about.

437
01:13:31,651 --> 01:13:35,409
Because of my audio, that video works.

438
01:13:36,005 --> 01:13:38,350
How can you call it a picture then?

439
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:48,164
Mixture.

440
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:51,310
Call picture, mixture then.

441
01:13:52,673 --> 01:13:56,080
Like bollywood, make furniture out of wood!

442
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:58,063
Yes this.

443
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:02,030
What kind of rhyming have you done?

444
01:14:06,096 --> 01:14:07,055
I am going now.

445
01:14:25,185 --> 01:14:28,254
Sir has got his new vanity van.
Its nice ri?ght

446
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,015
Sir, your shot is ready now.

447
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:35,545
You like the script, you do it..
I am leaving.

448
01:16:45,796 --> 01:16:48,724
Even after me saying no, how did you
dare to say yes for the film?

449
01:16:50,254 --> 01:16:52,153
Without me, what are you?

450
01:16:53,412 --> 01:16:56,058
You said yes by SMS.
Now do the film by sending SMS.

451
01:16:57,405 --> 01:17:02,823
With out my voice you are..
Finished.. Finished.

452
01:17:13,847 --> 01:17:17,694
If I am finished, then your voice is also finished.

453
01:17:33,302 --> 01:17:37,323
I will have to save this shit film for getting flopped.

454
01:17:49,105 --> 01:17:54,373
You should get married to me..
You should get married to me..

455
01:17:55,599 --> 01:18:00,094
You should get married to me.. Why?
Because your parents don't love you.

456
01:18:00,145 --> 01:18:03,257
But Why?.. What is your name?
Why you don't know.. Geeta.

457
01:18:03,442 --> 01:18:07,817
Oh Geeta, if your parents had loved you.
They wouldn't have kept your name as Geeta.

458
01:18:07,919 --> 01:18:09,216
Why? Whats wrong with name Geeta?

459
01:18:09,357 --> 01:18:13,442
If you love somebody, you will face deep struggle
for his love.

460
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:14,992
Finding a good name is a struggle.

461
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:18,891
And your parents didn't struggle.
And gave you a very common name Geeta.

462
01:18:18,936 --> 01:18:22,396
1st name that comes to our mind is Geeta.
1000's have the same name Geeta.

463
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,171
Probably the nursing home you were born was
named Geeta.

464
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:31,025
What kind of parent have you got Geeta.
So lazy to find a good name for thier own daughter!

465
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:32,528
I will call with love as 'Ta"

466
01:18:32,816 --> 01:18:35,585
I will marry you Ta,
And go tell your parents, Tata!

467
01:18:46,364 --> 01:18:49,111
Why are you saying thank you?
He is talking about the

468
01:18:49,135 --> 01:18:51,575
dialogue delivery, not
about your facial acting!

469
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:03,878
Such a big star. He gets the make up done
by me with full trust.

470
01:19:04,097 --> 01:19:06,590
Also drops his servant, by his own car.

471
01:19:06,769 --> 01:19:12,804
But the old chap is mad, He keeps talking to himself.
He keeps saying things.

472
01:19:13,426 --> 01:19:15,241
Please shut the AC.

473
01:19:25,337 --> 01:19:26,296
What is this?

474
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:29,698
Its an injection... No No, injection
No.. No.. Doctor.

475
01:19:39,897 --> 01:19:40,836
Nothing will happen.

476
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,141
Today he spoke for the 1st time.

477
01:20:34,555 --> 01:20:37,719
No.. No.. I am alright.
I will go home, take bath, and come back for shooting.

478
01:20:48,894 --> 01:20:53,503
No sir, today voice is a bit low.

479
01:20:54,821 --> 01:21:00,396
I can come.. No.. No.. Don't bother..
You take rest.. I will shoot some other scene.

480
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,776
You just rest, don't worry.

481
01:21:04,135 --> 01:21:06,463
See the love for your voice.

482
01:21:07,597 --> 01:21:09,579
I am hungry,  get me something to eat.

483
01:21:39,577 --> 01:21:41,943
This water is too hot, how to cool it?

484
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,309
Oh, burned!

485
01:21:47,852 --> 01:21:49,066
What are you doing?

486
01:21:57,251 --> 01:21:58,721
Jahanpanah, How are you?

487
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,999
Arrrh

488
01:22:12,525 --> 01:22:17,256
I have an idea sir.Once your voice gets clear.
I want be the 1st director to record a song in your voice sir.

489
01:22:17,495 --> 01:22:21,868
Sir, one song in your voice. Sir it will be sensational.

490
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:24,839
Will do it. Will do anything for you.

491
01:22:24,961 --> 01:22:26,687
Sir. Thank you so much sir.

492
01:22:28,452 --> 01:22:32,725
Arrrh, Arrrh, Why are yo taking too much tension.

493
01:22:34,432 --> 01:22:38,964
At the most people listening to your song,
will throw shoes or slippers at you. Thats it.

494
01:22:43,414 --> 01:22:44,949
You got me the injection!

495
01:22:51,111 --> 01:22:53,350
Akshara? Even I am not able to get through to her

496
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:56,575
Maybe network problem in
Sikkim, why does she have to

497
01:22:56,599 --> 01:22:59,503
go toSikkim to write script.
I really dont understand.

498
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:04,706
<i>Singing</i>

499
01:23:11,763 --> 01:23:13,712
Song note is too high I think.

500
01:23:24,069 --> 01:23:26,562
I have forgotten the words of the song.

501
01:23:43,526 --> 01:23:48,347
What.. Why?

502
01:23:49,145 --> 01:23:52,430
You got me an injection!

503
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:54,048
So now I will sing!

504
01:24:17,025 --> 01:24:21,137
I have rehearsing for over a week, You sent me the CD.
Then whats with this one line and piddly!

505
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:28,536
Piddly, English words sir.. Meaning short inquisitional things.

506
01:24:28,872 --> 01:24:33,052
Sir, in comparison to love, every thing is piddly.
And now day we need a hook line aswell.

507
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:38,261
If I do more rehearsal, my voice will get piddly.

508
01:24:49,339 --> 01:24:55,355
(Singing)

509
01:25:46,132 --> 01:25:49,693
In every partnership, one partners talent

510
01:25:50,408 --> 01:25:52,875
Its alway little more than the other partner.

511
01:26:30,624 --> 01:26:34,473
You used a short piddly word, you turned
it to a fantastic idea, sir.

512
01:26:58,414 --> 01:27:01,994
If you really love me, then find me
a toilet.

513
01:28:13,536 --> 01:28:18,618
Why do they call you Robert?
Your name on passport is Amitabh Sinha.

514
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:24,038
People call me Robert with love.

515
01:28:34,194 --> 01:28:40,038
If peon and star talk in same voice then people
will think of the peon as the star.

516
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:48,980
Wear and here.

517
01:29:54,434 --> 01:30:02,360
When things end at your age, and things begin at my age.

518
01:30:05,087 --> 01:30:16,723
In your age, for getting things done, you need my help.

519
01:30:17,383 --> 01:30:23,930
At my time, you wouldn't have even started.

520
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:06,341
You have spoiled my song...
Why did you spoil my song?

521
01:31:06,574 --> 01:31:11,075
Did I beg you to do this song for you?
Did I beg you to do this movie?

522
01:31:11,436 --> 01:31:14,121
You were the beggar, and I am the donator.

523
01:31:14,606 --> 01:31:17,637
To save you, to save your superstar image .

524
01:31:18,445 --> 01:31:21,035
I didn't have any inclining to listen to this song in my voice.

525
01:31:21,444 --> 01:31:24,366
Only this song could have saved your stupid film!

526
01:31:25,551 --> 01:31:29,851
You are so jelaous of my voice, that you
are ready to get the film flopped?

527
01:31:30,721 --> 01:31:33,904
You are the 1st begger, who is
jealous of his donator!

528
01:31:54,067 --> 01:31:57,238
Is bollywood changing from running around trees,
to running around loo's?

529
01:31:57,372 --> 01:31:58,773
What a brilliantoriginal idea.

530
01:31:58,837 --> 01:32:04,115
For years we have been seeing, heroine in chiffon
sarees, running around the snow in Alps.

531
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:08,169
Nobody would have thought in cold, even her bladder
getting burst!

532
01:33:08,759 --> 01:33:15,335
You are a non-smoker. You are such a huge youth icon.
If you campagin for us, it will make a huge difference.

533
01:33:17,683 --> 01:33:23,851
Why do youth start smoking? Usually for the image.
To show off.

534
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:28,086
Stylke should be thier, then whats the use
being youthfull.

535
01:33:28,374 --> 01:33:31,532
Lets give them another style..
Meaning?

536
01:33:32,005 --> 01:33:36,755
As a kid have tasted a candy, the one in shape of ciggarate?

537
01:34:06,462 --> 01:34:09,223
Called you to London, for a speech?
Us?

538
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:14,098
But I will be the one to do the talking.

539
01:35:24,097 --> 01:35:28,800
Giving a speech, taking all the claps meant for me.

540
01:35:46,523 --> 01:35:49,995
How did this place come here again?

541
01:35:53,947 --> 01:35:55,980
How did I reach from there to here again?

542
01:36:09,761 --> 01:36:11,871
You know, you are the real actor.

543
01:36:12,273 --> 01:36:13,553
You will understand.

544
01:36:19,239 --> 01:36:20,530
Sorry my friend.

545
01:36:21,519 --> 01:36:24,064
I forgot get the net?

546
01:36:25,147 --> 01:36:26,356
He escaped.

547
01:36:30,143 --> 01:36:33,561
When yo have a hand,
leg and face..

548
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:40,324
A Camera, Bike, super banground
music,then anyone can become an actor.

549
01:36:47,728 --> 01:36:50,470
Sorry my friend, I forgot to get the net.

550
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:53,617
This is acting.

551
01:36:54,232 --> 01:37:03,456
No hand, no leg, no trolley, no bike..
Only voice.

552
01:37:04,697 --> 01:37:06,992
Whisky is love.

553
01:37:07,856 --> 01:37:10,694
And water is everywhere.

554
01:37:12,859 --> 01:37:22,503
This is real acting.. You show it to me..
Come.. Hey come here!

555
01:37:23,934 --> 01:37:26,919
Why are you stuck there?
Come down here.

556
01:37:29,024 --> 01:37:30,781
Do you want me to come and get you down?

557
01:37:31,497 --> 01:37:36,952
What the hell, he thinks he is a VIP.
That I have to get you personally.

558
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:39,436
Get down you!

559
01:37:44,228 --> 01:37:49,733
I will get this from up there.. Be steady.
Common baby, get down from there.

560
01:39:45,481 --> 01:39:48,556
What happend is done.
It wont happen again.

561
01:40:04,493 --> 01:40:07,422
I am very ashamed of him.

562
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:10,115
But is my servant

563
01:40:20,405 --> 01:40:22,861
For what ever that happend...

564
01:40:25,969 --> 01:40:30,060
For what ever that happend...
I am asking all you media people.

565
01:40:31,052 --> 01:40:36,543
All citizens of India.. The whole population of London.
The whole world.

566
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:41,045
I want to say is, I am not a bit ashamed!

567
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:45,121
What sir? Why such Insults?
Are you in your senses.

568
01:41:29,694 --> 01:41:59,797
(abusing)

569
01:42:00,891 --> 01:42:03,518
For you say A to Z abuses at me, you will need me.

570
01:42:03,697 --> 01:42:05,257
And you are ashamed of me.

571
01:42:05,423 --> 01:42:08,076
How could you dare, be ashamed of me?

572
01:42:13,272 --> 01:42:15,784
Giving me a cheque of 10 million
ruppee, doesn't give you any

573
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,186
right to be ashamed of me. I
dont need a job from you!

574
01:42:21,905 --> 01:42:25,566
Bar closed, you won't get any whisky!
Go drink water!

575
01:42:52,701 --> 01:42:57,049
To speak to media, to tell people,
you will need a voice, you fool.

576
01:42:57,658 --> 01:43:04,612
Where will you get it from? Order online from Amazon?
He is your voice, without him you are nothing.

577
01:43:07,695 --> 01:43:10,891
Swallow your ego, lets go and ask for
forgivness.

578
01:43:13,994 --> 01:43:16,757
My script is ready.

579
01:43:28,163 --> 01:43:30,029
In a movie, its the hero who talks.

580
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:37,157
There is no melodrama.

581
01:43:54,365 --> 01:43:56,346
Its independence day today.

582
01:43:57,943 --> 01:43:59,413
The cemetery is closed.

583
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:04,021
Take the body some where else.

584
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,572
Amitabh... Don't touch me.

585
01:44:10,116 --> 01:44:11,375
Hey, listen.

586
01:44:13,575 --> 01:44:17,198
No, Stop.. Stop.

587
01:44:17,322 --> 01:44:22,641
After touching a corpse, you should take bath,
before touching someone.

588
01:44:28,749 --> 01:44:33,601
To lift a corpse, you need a shoulder.

589
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:36,689
Shoulder.

590
01:44:37,693 --> 01:44:42,491
And when the shoulder feels pity for the corpse,
and has been crarying the cropes away..

591
01:44:42,739 --> 01:44:47,241
And if the corpse thinks of its pyre as a its throne.

592
01:44:47,475 --> 01:44:53,267
And if the corpse thinks he is the king.
And the shoulder its servant.

593
01:44:53,312 --> 01:44:56,170
Treats the servant, as if he ashamed of him.

594
01:44:57,866 --> 01:45:04,795
Then its the responsibility of the shoulder, to bring the corpse down and remind it thats its a corpse.

595
01:45:05,434 --> 01:45:08,490
Without the shoulder, the corpse will decay lying in the street.

596
01:45:08,944 --> 01:45:17,042
And.. even a hungry street dogs would be ashamed
of touching the corpse.

597
01:45:23,813 --> 01:45:29,312
I want to tell the whole world, that I am not
even a bit ashamed.

598
01:45:29,664 --> 01:45:32,375
What does he think of himself?

599
01:45:32,695 --> 01:45:35,782
No my friend, there must be something wrong.

600
01:45:45,779 --> 01:45:48,677
Sir its out of sync, the voice doesnt sync with the lip movment.

601
01:45:50,794 --> 01:45:54,668
There is no technical error. Everything else is in sync.
See.. Something is wrong.

602
01:46:02,975 --> 01:46:05,149
All of sudden, holiday in Finland.

603
01:46:07,099 --> 01:46:09,527
What is he doing in Finland?

604
01:46:45,707 --> 01:46:48,136
You want act a speech impaired person?

605
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:02,240
How will you talk to the director?
How will you talk to the Writer?

606
01:47:08,593 --> 01:47:10,686
 You are going talk for my film?

607
01:47:12,195 --> 01:47:15,049
What will I do?
How will make my film?

608
01:47:15,734 --> 01:47:17,333
Should I forget about it?

609
01:47:21,707 --> 01:47:24,414
No way, why should I make a film
on your idea?

610
01:47:32,793 --> 01:47:37,379
Do you think that, drunkard would return?
After hearning the news about the new film?

611
01:47:40,330 --> 01:47:41,749
Means, I am screwed!

612
01:47:55,358 --> 01:47:58,331
In world of monkeys, is there a shortage of female monkeys?

613
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,639
Is it?

614
01:48:00,645 --> 01:48:01,974
Are your days going so bad?

615
01:48:02,007 --> 01:48:04,948
That you are not able to get any sexy actress?
So why not take a chance on a weak director?

616
01:48:05,204 --> 01:48:08,537
So that she could forget her only dream,
and only see your thousands of dream?

617
01:48:24,242 --> 01:48:27,676
Boy and Girl, both can't speak?

618
01:48:27,837 --> 01:48:34,454
Yes.. Trying.. But thats different and long back..
In movie Burfi.

619
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:37,677
No. We mudo this. Fantastic it will be.

620
01:48:37,768 --> 01:48:44,455
I want to speak to him now. Sir he doesn't want to speak,
so he is learning sign language.

621
01:48:44,788 --> 01:48:49,883
He wants to feel the quietness within him.

622
01:48:55,981 --> 01:48:58,666
Every actor in the industry should do this.

623
01:49:00,193 --> 01:49:03,837
For heroine role he wants someone, who cant speak in real life.

624
01:49:04,074 --> 01:49:05,582
Fantastic Choice.

625
01:49:06,766 --> 01:49:08,997
We have to do a lot of planning,
Atleast now open your mouth.

626
01:49:13,828 --> 01:49:16,206
Sir, till the time film doesn't end,
he won't speak.

627
01:49:20,392 --> 01:49:23,722
Won't speak till the end?
.. Till the end?

628
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:25,945
Bet?

629
01:49:26,079 --> 01:49:27,038
For sure..

630
01:49:27,236 --> 01:49:31,066
by the end of the 1st if you dont come up to me
and say I have another idea.

631
01:49:31,367 --> 01:49:38,801
If you don't, then I will stop making films.
I.. Will.. Stop.. Making.. Films.

632
01:49:55,098 --> 01:49:58,096
 Jahanpanah, here is hot hot biryani for you.

633
01:50:07,821 --> 01:50:08,780
What happend?

634
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:16,223
Jahanpanah.

635
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:20,507
What is this happening?
Without sim card, how is the mobile working?

636
01:50:31,585 --> 01:50:33,055
Keep my table reserved.

637
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:36,870
Don't give it anyone else.

638
01:50:37,906 --> 01:50:39,248
Where are you going?

639
01:50:39,506 --> 01:50:50,494
If water can grow without whisky.
Then imagine, the high whisky can give without water.

640
01:50:50,568 --> 01:50:55,324
Hey I want make a movie with Shamitabh.
But he is on high with the sucess he has got.

641
01:50:55,465 --> 01:50:57,395
Dad, speak to Rabir

642
01:50:57,831 --> 01:51:02,591
Please get me a sweet lime juice please.. Ok Sir.
What will the poor producer do?

643
01:51:02,937 --> 01:51:05,001
In the whole industry, there are only 4 heros.

644
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:09,231
Why only counting 4? Dont
you see the big star

645
01:51:09,255 --> 01:51:12,992
their drinking sweet
lime and sitting there.

646
01:51:13,637 --> 01:51:19,134
Love is such a useless thing. For which...

647
01:51:29,784 --> 01:51:32,882
Love is such a useless thing,
even after giving it all your

648
01:51:32,906 --> 01:51:36,158
precious time, in return you dont
even get a second hand watch.

649
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:39,713
The voice is just like Shamitabh..
But has more power than him.

650
01:51:39,867 --> 01:51:43,703
And this voice on my 6foot 3inch son,
will set him on fire.

651
01:51:44,103 --> 01:51:47,860
Voice is like Shamitabh.
But the bass is stronger.

652
01:52:02,912 --> 01:52:06,013
Such a waste..
I like this script a lot.

653
01:52:11,845 --> 01:52:14,248
Bhiwani sir, stop him.
If he leaves, we are doomed.

654
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,722
Sir please. For me.

655
01:52:32,423 --> 01:52:34,021
Can't you see.. You fool.

656
01:52:34,941 --> 01:52:38,988
Thappad, is name of new film made by famous
producer Mr Keshav Bhiwani.

657
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:41,798
In which he is launching his own son Armaan.

658
01:52:41,946 --> 01:52:45,603
Sir, please tell about your film?
My film would be a action packed masala film.

659
01:52:45,655 --> 01:52:45,910
Ok..

660
01:52:46,734 --> 01:52:49,330
Launch your son, he look like a star.

661
01:53:06,970 --> 01:53:08,568
Common talk my friend.

662
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:20,643
What my mom didn't give when I was a Kid.
As a youth what a girl didn't give.

663
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:40,062
In such films you cant have deadly dance numbers.

664
01:54:43,585 --> 01:54:46,322
It should be released in all theatre.
And It will be awesome movie.

665
01:54:46,423 --> 01:54:49,793
If you slap it before the release,
Then what splaps will be there to see in the movie?

666
01:54:49,934 --> 01:54:54,447
Meaning..
The biggest slap for the movie is the voice of your son.

667
01:54:54,735 --> 01:54:59,742
Why are you hiting it for free?
Save it for the friday in the theatre.

668
01:55:00,554 --> 01:55:03,112
There will be claps, evryday and latter.

669
01:55:04,167 --> 01:55:05,126
Play the song.

670
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:25,125
We should promote this film with full dignity.

671
01:55:25,509 --> 01:55:29,504
I need a full page article on daily basis.
Watch out for Armaan.

672
01:55:29,786 --> 01:55:32,663
No stupid promotions, Shamitabh wont come
for the cookery show.

673
01:55:32,682 --> 01:55:34,866
Sir, Shamitabh's movie is very hot.

674
01:55:34,931 --> 01:55:36,657
Don't clash with his movie.

675
01:55:38,083 --> 01:55:41,299
No.. December 4,We will relese our film.

676
01:55:41,338 --> 01:55:44,259
Sir, we have heard that you want talk until,
the release of your film by 4th December?

677
01:55:45,578 --> 01:55:49,152
The subject line of the picture is very sensitive...
Talking in sign language?

678
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:55,093
You people from media can create difference between
a persons voice and face.

679
01:56:18,008 --> 01:56:22,428
The controversial superstar Shamitabh's
new film Ishhhhhhq, is releasing today.

Visit DDRTorrents.com

683
01:57:10,918 --> 01:57:14,211
How did you like Ishhhhhq, the movie?
Its a classy movie, but not like Lifebouy.

684
01:57:14,256 --> 01:57:15,979
How did you like the
movie Thappad!?

685
01:57:16,003 --> 01:57:18,750
Over a dead body, there is a
loud voice.Its a scary movie.

686
01:57:18,871 --> 01:57:22,259
Shamitab is good, but without voice
its not the same Shamitabh.

687
01:57:22,828 --> 01:57:25,807
By coppying Shamitabh's voice, anyone can't
become Shamitabh.

688
01:57:25,877 --> 01:57:27,157
It was a time waste.

689
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:18,190
It will be soon released on Kindle.

690
01:58:19,059 --> 01:58:21,647
The rise and fall of Shamitabh.

691
01:58:23,315 --> 01:58:29,094
If you want to stop this book.
You will have to write something new.

692
01:58:36,511 --> 01:58:38,556
And ther is only one way for it.

693
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,986
He is also a flop..
The drunkard will be back.

694
01:58:49,349 --> 01:58:50,373
If you call him.

695
01:58:59,001 --> 01:59:03,650
In life, you didn't think of the end?

696
01:59:05,782 --> 01:59:08,276
Don't be so selfish, Take a damm break.

697
01:59:18,432 --> 01:59:19,391
Think about me!

698
01:59:19,403 --> 01:59:21,550
Do something for me atleast!

699
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:34,191
Madam, Jahanpanahs phone, only has 2 numbers, one is yours
and other is of Shamitabh sir.

700
01:59:35,732 --> 01:59:39,013
For past 3 days, he's been
drinking a lot, Jahanpanah.

701
01:59:39,037 --> 01:59:43,263
Its 1st time I am feeling scared.What
if something happens to him.

702
01:59:43,383 --> 01:59:44,483
I will have to use this very hands.

703
01:59:48,968 --> 01:59:49,927
Is there water?

704
02:00:02,258 --> 02:00:05,375
Before burrying the corpse.
Its given a bath.

705
02:00:07,116 --> 02:00:09,187
Give him a bottle of water.

706
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:39,446
No water.. Whisky.. Whisky.
Open a whisky

707
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:41,195
There is no need for water.

708
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:43,785
He is water, and himself whisky.

709
02:00:44,156 --> 02:00:45,755
So he doesn't like water.

710
02:00:46,308 --> 02:00:49,620
It is his big philosophy.

711
02:00:52,607 --> 02:00:54,850
You fool! Look here.

712
02:00:55,328 --> 02:00:57,489
Look here.. What is this?

713
02:00:58,218 --> 02:01:02,179
43% Alcohol, rest 57% is water!

714
02:01:02,371 --> 02:01:05,362
Whisky is made with water.
Without water there is no whisky

715
02:01:05,707 --> 02:01:09,799
If you were in such ego, you should have read its label atleast.

716
02:01:47,011 --> 02:01:53,139
You should never send a bigger back empty handed.

717
02:01:58,514 --> 02:02:02,093
Go.. Get up..
No...!!

718
02:02:11,610 --> 02:02:19,072
I.. dont need help getting up.

719
02:02:30,018 --> 02:02:30,977
So say.

720
02:02:32,825 --> 02:02:34,058
Speak.. speak.

721
02:02:37,661 --> 02:02:42,136
I forgot.. You fool can't speak.

722
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,079
What?

723
02:02:50,026 --> 02:02:51,688
You fallen now.

724
02:02:52,417 --> 02:02:56,216
Fallen.. before I could.

725
02:02:57,102 --> 02:03:01,212
What were you before me?

726
02:03:02,176 --> 02:03:03,135
Zero.

727
02:03:03,159 --> 02:03:06,236
What? What? Say?

728
02:03:06,893 --> 02:03:09,092
You were a zero before me.

729
02:03:09,425 --> 02:03:11,150
And after also zero.

730
02:03:11,972 --> 02:03:14,931
Only in between, a hero.

731
02:03:16,307 --> 02:03:22,776
Because behind that zero was a hero.. Hero!

732
02:03:41,079 --> 02:03:42,863
What are your age?

733
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:45,273
97 Years

734
02:03:45,557 --> 02:03:50,097
Both your ages added, you should have 97years
of knowledge in between.

735
02:03:52,733 --> 02:03:55,929
Nor would anyone have knowledge about it like you.

736
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,916
Move it, of I will beat you up.
And burry you here only.

737
02:04:20,417 --> 02:04:22,999
Stop.. Stop.. Where are you going?

738
02:04:28,009 --> 02:04:31,200
Please sir 5 minutes here...
Sit down.

739
02:04:39,582 --> 02:04:40,803
And now kids.

740
02:04:41,191 --> 02:04:44,330
Now will learn the ABCD of life.

741
02:04:45,258 --> 02:04:48,838
If you dont pay attention, you would get a kick from me.

742
02:04:52,638 --> 02:04:54,205
No one can live alone.

743
02:04:56,782 --> 02:04:59,786
If you want to grow, you have to stay together.

744
02:05:01,643 --> 02:05:05,587
You know very well. A person who things he
can get things done and grow on his own.

745
02:05:08,047 --> 02:05:10,591
How far can a person go all alone?

746
02:05:20,666 --> 02:05:22,916
If you don't help each other,
You guys go into hiding.

747
02:05:26,359 --> 02:05:30,260
If you don't act intelligent,
then both would become a joke.

748
02:06:18,581 --> 02:06:22,417
Film also would be in black?
Or would there be any colours?

749
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:26,971
The title is good.

750
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:45,642
Stop, where are you going?

751
02:06:45,743 --> 02:06:50,138
Is this Shamitabh's house, I have a meeting
with him.. You need permission.. I have Permission.

752
02:07:03,721 --> 02:07:07,678
I know that.. You.

753
02:07:08,187 --> 02:07:12,591
are my director, and I am yor actor.

754
02:07:27,293 --> 02:07:29,211
I also want to be father of your kids.

755
02:07:35,795 --> 02:07:37,905
You come into the wrong industry.

756
02:07:39,007 --> 02:07:42,887
here in casting couch, actors need to sleep
with directors.

757
02:07:44,169 --> 02:07:46,030
Not director with actors.

758
02:07:50,413 --> 02:07:51,883
What will I get to see?

759
02:07:52,149 --> 02:07:53,108
Your tail?

761
02:08:47,284 --> 02:08:51,375
What do we do?
What if he says the truth during the film launh?

762
02:08:58,903 --> 02:09:01,844
I want to tell the truth to the world.. What?

763
02:09:07,688 --> 02:09:09,184
Akshara's flim is getting started.

764
02:09:09,933 --> 02:09:11,406
and you want to tell the truth?

765
02:09:11,784 --> 02:09:12,991
very bad idea.

766
02:09:13,151 --> 02:09:16,264
Truth.. Is worlds biggest idea.

767
02:09:16,918 --> 02:09:20,041
If you say the truth. Then people who disclose
the thruth on ur behalf would go quiet.

768
02:09:21,244 --> 02:09:26,160
Yes.. I am dumb.. This my voice.
The technology that brings it together.. And thats done.

769
02:09:26,688 --> 02:09:28,049
What can anyone do after that?

770
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:35,094
If you the truth. The fear is lost.

771
02:09:36,699 --> 02:09:39,385
By sayin the truth, shock value increases.

772
02:09:39,495 --> 02:09:41,189
Shamitabh is dumb.

773
02:09:41,387 --> 02:09:44,296
Superstar Shamitabh is dumb.

774
02:09:49,396 --> 02:09:53,292
 By saying the truth, emotions would flow.

775
02:09:58,205 --> 02:10:08,016
One dumb person.. With his passion.
And left behind is handicap, and reached the heights of success.

776
02:10:11,095 --> 02:10:12,863
And one more advantage on the side.

777
02:10:13,508 --> 02:10:23,015
That more dumb people will make use of this technology.
And Shamitabh being the brand ambassador, will be an advantage.

778
02:10:26,168 --> 02:10:29,831
The biggest advantage of telling the truth.

779
02:10:37,851 --> 02:10:40,536
Tsunami of emotions will fill the theatre.

780
02:10:41,301 --> 02:10:45,738
People will open their eyes, and see Shamitabh's performance.

781
02:10:46,282 --> 02:10:51,076
Every ears would be hearing hero
Shamitabh's dialogue.

782
02:10:51,861 --> 02:10:55,946
And for this dumb guy,people would be play a touching
background music, in teir hearts.

783
02:10:56,513 --> 02:10:59,390
People will whistle and cry at the same time.

785
02:12:07,178 --> 02:12:12,620
If say the truth, I wont ever be drinking alcohol.
You are going to divorce me.

786
02:12:13,529 --> 02:12:14,743
You so intelligent.

787
02:12:15,569 --> 02:12:19,022
Wearing such ugly T-shirt, for your super star launch.

788
02:12:19,169 --> 02:12:21,407
Full focus would be on yor T-shirt.

789
02:12:21,726 --> 02:12:25,907
I will have to say a interesting history of this T-shirt.

790
02:12:26,873 --> 02:12:30,326
Shirt is your way to get people take attention off me.

791
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:31,489
I understood.

792
02:12:51,151 --> 02:12:52,557
I wish I was dumb too.

793
02:12:54,188 --> 02:12:57,615
When a normal person grows big in strature,
he only becomes big.

794
02:12:58,044 --> 02:13:03,726
But when a handicp person becomes big in strature.
He becomes a legend.

795
02:13:10,725 --> 02:13:15,328
Even if I say the truth, like everytime.
Its again a advantage for you.

796
02:13:37,141 --> 02:13:38,631
Is it my sister in law's love message for you?

797
02:13:39,315 --> 02:13:43,512
She could have easily come with us,but she wanted to be thier 4 hours before.

798
02:13:43,535 --> 02:13:48,157
to check mike,and see if every thing is in order.
Or else how would these females stay calm.

799
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:49,595
Thinking the lyrics.
I have not becme Javed Akhatar yet.

800
02:17:13,587 --> 02:17:15,626
It would be hard to get the voice back.

801
02:17:31,197 --> 02:17:33,805
Without my voice you are finished.

802
02:19:15,390 --> 02:19:19,903
If I am finished, then your voice too is finished.

803
02:21:52,886 --> 02:21:53,859
Love is a film.

804
02:21:55,015 --> 02:21:56,166
Passion is a film.

805
02:21:56,777 --> 02:21:58,497
Pain is a film.

806
02:21:59,086 --> 02:22:00,300
Medicine is a film.

807
02:22:01,119 --> 02:22:02,333
A praise is a film.

808
02:22:03,884 --> 02:22:05,591
A Salute to the film.

809
02:22:05,994 --> 02:22:07,336
