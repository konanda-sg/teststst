1
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,292
Priya, listen to me

2
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:50,417
Let go of me

3
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:53,417
You always do this,
it's always other women

4
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:54,833
I didn't mean to hurt you

5
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,708
Every time you say the same thing

6
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,958
You know how much I love you

7
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,500
Please, listen to me

8
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,958
I love you so much

9
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:07,500
Cut!

10
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,542
<i>Kama, good for you'?</i>

11
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,417
Guys we'll do one more

12
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,250
We got this shot right?

13
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:41,583
We are running out of time, we don't
have permission for the whole day...

14
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,708
Kaira has a nice idea,
we'll do one more

15
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,333
What's the point of finishing
on time if we don't get a good shot?

16
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,167
Look, no respect for producers

17
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:54,625
Especially these new
cameraman... sorry... women

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,083
Come on, hurry up, let's do this!

19
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,250
Fatima, we are going to change the guy

20
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,000
You want the other guy?

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,125
He's got to look a little sexy

22
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,333
Get the camera

23
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,125
Cut!

24
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,083
Got that?

25
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,333
Fantastic!

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,458
Superb execution!

27
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,125
Good shot

28
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,708
I shot it at 48 frames,
speed up the end if you like

29
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,542
I'm going to take a
plate of the building now

30
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,417
Saw the shot Raghuvendra?

31
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:46,542
That one expression of the girl
checking out the passing guy says so much

32
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:51,000
I wish I had met Kaira earlier, I
would have shot the whole film with her

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,292
I got that

34
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,875
It's a wrap guys! Thank you!

35
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,625
Told you, don't have to carry my bag

36
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,625
I'm so sorry

37
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,083
Your mom called on
my cellphone earlier...

38
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,875
you never pick up yours...

39
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,667
please call her back,
before you take off

40
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:19,208
I will, you enjoy your mini holiday

41
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,542
You could have enjoyed
Singapore with us...

42
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,333
but you wanted to
fly with someone else

43
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:25,292
Shut up

44
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:26,583
Go go

45
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,667
I tried to upgrade you, couldn't do it

46
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:34,750
Please

47
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,500
Hi guys what can I get for you?

48
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:37,708
Beer
- Coke

49
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,417
Just Coke?

50
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:44,000
I drink only on two occasions,
when I am in love and when I am not

51
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,375
Okay...

52
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,250
Cheers!

53
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,250
Kaira, everything okay?

54
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,292
As in we're good right?

55
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,208
What are you talking about,
what happened to us?

56
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,417
Cheers!

57
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,458
Raghuvendra, I want to
shoot an entire feature film...

58
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,333
enough of this patchwork

59
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,292
I mean I can't keep waiting
for other cameramen to fall ill...

60
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,792
no one will even know
that I've shot this scene

61
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:25,375
I want to shoot my own film

62
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,583
You will

63
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:30,500
Who wouldn't want to work
with a hot DOP like you?

64
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,292
Hot!

65
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,667
Is that my only talent, seriously?

66
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:34,792
Seriously

67
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,458
Don't talk to me

68
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,083
Of course you're talented...

69
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,833
You are shooting so many
ads...earning good money

70
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,542
Ads and all are fine

71
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,375
I want to shoot a film

72
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,625
You will, you will, soon

73
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,708
And you're so young, I mean...

74
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:52,375
you wear zero number
glasses to look older

75
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,708
Excuse me?

76
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,875
If actresses can be at their peak at
a young age then why not technicians?

77
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:00,250
Have you heard of the word 'Patience'?

78
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:03,417
No I haven't, tell me about 'Patience'

79
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:08,917
Pick up...

80
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:10,750
pick up the cook's call...

81
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,458
if you want I can
just go and come back

82
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,417
He is not a cook,
he is the owner of a restaurant

83
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,292
Not even a cook?

84
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,875
That shot was your idea right?

85
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:28,292
Girl with guy, checking out other guy?

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,375
Inspired from life?

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Listen Kaira...

88
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,833
you take my seat, I'll take yours...

89
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,333
I can sit in Economy class,
no need to sacrifice

90
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,083
Your long legs won't
fit in there anyway

91
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,208
That is true

92
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,167
It is very true

93
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:50,292
Yes Mom, it was good

94
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,875
Can't talk now,
the plane is going to take off

95
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:54,958
Bye!

96
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,083
So...

97
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,208
can I come up?

98
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,125
I'm really tired

99
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,042
Dinner?

100
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm busy, but I'll see you

101
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,875
Alka!

102
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,042
<i>Didi! (Sister)</i>

103
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,292
You've become so fat!

104
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,083
How was your flight?

105
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,667
Your mother called 3 times

106
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,333
You are so sweet Alka

107
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,708
Thank you!

108
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,750
Do you want coffee
or shall I serve breakfast?

109
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,500
Later

110
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,542
<i>Didi...</i>

111
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,583
this guy is so cute

112
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,583
Was cute!

113
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,375
Was!

114
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,083
I don't find him cute anymore...

115
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,542
just take down his photo

116
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:08,000
I just put it all in perfect order

117
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,333
Now it's perfect

118
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,542
So then, how was your trip?

119
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,000
It was good

120
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,042
Just good?

121
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,833
Okay, great

122
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,833
You look beautiful sweetheart

123
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,625
Sorry, I'll just...

124
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:11,250
No it's okay, go ahead

125
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,917
Table for 4 please?

126
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:16,417
I'm sorry guys,
we have a strict dress code

127
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:17,750
No shorts and slippers please

128
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,542
Come on, it's his birthday

129
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:20,667
I'm sorry, wish I could

130
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,708
But she's wearing shorts!

131
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,833
It's okay for girls, I'm sorry guys

132
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,333
Just this once, only for you

133
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,625
Next time I'll come along
on shoot with you, as your caterer

134
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,708
What do you say?

135
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,125
I slept with Raghuvendra

136
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,292
I should go...

137
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,750
Sid...

138
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,125
I'm sorry

139
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,167
What are you doing!

140
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,292
It's all good!

141
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,625
It's okay, it's all good...

142
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,875
Hey look, Sid!

143
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,375
Shit! Where?

144
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,500
That's not Sid, Jackie

145
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,792
He looked so much like him...cute

146
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,875
Poor thing, nice guy he was

147
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:41,458
Really nice

148
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,833
Little too nice for you right?

149
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,667
Oh my God! This jacket!

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It reminds me of school,
our 'Famous Five' gang

151
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,875
Was that the 8th or 9th grade?

152
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,958
10th grade, same one

153
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,750
See, I can have a long
term relationship too

154
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,292
Yes, with things

155
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,333
So are we things too?

156
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,333
Yes, you are a thing

157
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:11,917
Sorry

158
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,667
Have you gone blind in love?
Am I invisible?

159
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:15,833
We said sorry

160
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,917
Staring into her eyes!

161
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:20,917
They are a couple

162
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:23,833
'Oh my coochie coo'
'So sweet I love you'...

163
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:26,250
The same rubbish crap it's irritating

164
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,708
What are you doing?

165
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,792
Go to hell!

166
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,958
Stupid! Hate couples!

167
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,167
Are you guys here to help
me or to do a comedy show?

168
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,125
Both

169
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:48,333
Guys I have a deadline, I have
to show the director the costumes

170
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,458
Fine

171
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,417
Raunak do you need help?

172
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:55,167
Listen, I've to go,
I have my 'BD' appointment

173
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,417
What's this 'BD'?

174
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:58,167
'Brain Doctor', my therapist

175
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:01,208
Oh 'BD'... Raunak you're
still going to that 'BD'?

176
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,125
I have to

177
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:04,875
'Brain Doctor'?
Why are you seeing a therapist?

178
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:05,750
Are you mad?

179
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,125
Who isn't? Look at him

180
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,500
That's a cut, nice

181
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:21,708
Good for you Kaira?

182
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:22,750
Good for me

183
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,583
<i>Rubbish I
can direct better than this!</i>

184
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,833
Tell me something...

185
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,292
Why did you start
seeing your therapist?

186
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,542
So that you could
tell everyone you're gay?

187
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,458
No

188
00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:00,000
So that I could tell myself, I'm gay

189
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,292
When is your flight to Goa?

190
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:12,917
Don't remind me I can't
believe I'm going to Goa

191
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:16,125
You're the first human
being who's saying this so sadly

192
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,708
It's Goa! Enjoy

193
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,167
Shut up

194
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,750
And yes it is sad...

195
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,458
Because I'm going on duty

196
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,417
Every 2-3 months
have to go show my face

197
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,875
Raghu?

198
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,125
Duty!

199
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,500
Yes mom, I'm coming tomorrow

200
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,833
What's with this food every time!

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,167
Make what you like,
don't ask me I'm busy

202
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,792
Mothers! Same standard
question every time...

203
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:49,500
'What will you eat' 'What to make'

204
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,500
Either she isn't my real
mother or she's had a memory loss

205
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,333
Kaira!

206
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,500
At least eat my food...

207
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,583
Only way to handle the torture...

208
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,250
I think this time I'll
work on my short film

209
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,375
Short film

210
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,875
The longest project of this century

211
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:05,875
That's so bitchy

212
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:06,750
It's true

213
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,542
How do you like my French food?

214
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,417
Landlord? I'm not answering

215
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:13,167
I don't know about French
food but this dip is amazing

216
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:15,208
Full Indian spice, try it

217
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,792
The dip is from Kaira's fridge
I have made the puff pastries

218
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,542
Jackie, at last you made something

219
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,875
What do you mean, at last?

220
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:27,833
You film people think that
only you do important work...

221
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,500
and the rest of us are useless?

222
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,667
I have decided to work on myself

223
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,833
That's tough work

224
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,208
Do it, do it

225
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,833
What's wrong with you?

226
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,167
I'm not going to Goa

227
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:42,875
Guess what?

228
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:45,375
'Raghu' your friend called...

229
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:49,167
and I have to shoot
a music video here in 3 days

230
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:49,875
Now get ready

231
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:50,542
<i>okay</i>

232
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:53,250
I have never seen anybody
so excited not going to Goa

233
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:55,708
No Goa

234
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,375
What happened to her?

235
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,042
It's not because of my food

236
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,792
Okay everybody,
just get away from the table

237
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,125
This food is contaminated

238
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,375
<i>Hey Fats...you good?</i>

239
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:15,875
Koko

240
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:16,333
Yes

241
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,458
Guess what?

242
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:18,917
What's up?

243
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,542
I'm Pregnant!

244
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,375
What?

245
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,250
It wasn't Jackie's food

246
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:26,667
Oh my God Fatty! Congratulations!

247
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,542
I mean we're supposed
to be happy right?

248
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know...
I want to throw up right now

249
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,083
Should I go?

250
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes please

251
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,000
No I'm just kidding

252
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:42,708
I'm just very excited

253
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,458
Are you pregnant too?

254
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,042
So I was working on a co-production
with this New York film company...

255
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,542
and it has come through

256
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,667
Thank you

257
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,958
Wow, you are going to be
shooting a feature in the US?

258
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:57,542
Yes

259
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,167
Tell me more...good script?

260
00:18:59,168 --> 00:18:59,875
Superb

261
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:02,208
Are you going to be
filming 'in' New York?

262
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,875
You are going to
be filming in New York

263
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,292
As in 'we' are going
to be filming in New York

264
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,958
if you're not available
we'll get another camera person...

265
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,042
Oh my God...l will kill you!

266
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,667
Told you, not going to Goa is lucky

267
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,958
Lucky for you, unlucky for me...

268
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,000
I want to kill my husband...

269
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,208
You're sure right?

270
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:29,417
It's not because
you think I'm hot right?

271
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,208
Obviously... you think
it's because you're talented?

272
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:38,292
What's wrong with your head?
Why are you so complicated?

273
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:40,333
You're the best,
that's why you got the job...

274
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:41,250
Simple

275
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:46,167
Thank you, appreciate it

276
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,250
<i>So let's break up</i>

00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,083
<i>Basically basically basically...</i>

290
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:23,625
<i>I'm a rascal</i>

291
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,000
It's a wrap!

292
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:39,083
Hi mommy, congratulations!

293
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,500
Fatima the fatty!

294
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,667
Cute guy

295
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,125
So many men in your life

296
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:51,500
Shut up

297
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,958
You'll also get to spend
time with Raghu also...

298
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,792
when you're in New York,
shooting for 3 months

299
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,500
Hello ladies, and one gent

300
00:21:59,167 --> 00:21:59,542
Oh hello?

301
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:01,167
Oh sorry two gents

302
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:05,375
Can I steal Kaira for a minute?

303
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:08,125
Thief! Even we want to hear

304
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:08,500
What?

305
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:09,917
Even we want to hear!

306
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:11,667
What? I can't hear anything

307
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,833
Okay pose

308
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,542
Nice one

309
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,875
So I'm off to New York tonight

310
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,208
What?

311
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:29,125
Yes

312
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,375
The financiers want to meet urgently

313
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,667
Someone has to fly so that you can

314
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,500
Ok go, fly...

315
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,417
Have a nice flight

316
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:44,292
That's it?

317
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,833
Have a nice flight?

318
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,375
What else do I say?

319
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,500
Say something

320
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,292
You pulled me here,
you say something

321
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,667
Firstly stop looking so hot

322
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,625
Tie your hair up

323
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:05,333
And behave yourself,
just for two weeks

324
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:08,833
Here you 90, haPPY?

325
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,167
<i>Vet'; “WW</i>

326
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:11,125
How do I look?

327
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:12,792
Lovely

328
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,625
So I had to talk to
you about something...

329
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,000
Do you want to hit the dance floor?

330
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,125
<i>Hi Justin Bieber</i>

331
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We're just in the
middle of a conversation

332
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,167
Anyway, you were saying

333
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:33,958
I was saying that...

334
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,833
Gautami...

335
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:37,500
who?

336
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,833
Gautami Sharma will be
the line producer of the film...

337
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,833
0k, so?

338
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,417
The financiers have recommended her...

339
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,333
they think she is the
best person for this job

340
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,958
What are you trying to say?

341
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Gautami and I, many years ago...

342
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,458
were in a relationship

343
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:04,042
Okay, it's a reunion! That's amazing

344
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,542
Reunion my foot...

345
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:08,292
It's going to be a
really awkward situation

346
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:11,250
I mean she was such a weird one...

347
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:12,792
I don't even feel like seeing her

348
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:18,958
I just want the job to go smoothly,
and I thought you should know

349
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,792
Cool, whatever

350
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,250
What 'whatever'? Come here...

351
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:33,083
Anyway I've had someone else
on my mind for a while now

352
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,542
Look I think...

353
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:49,667
it's time that we got
serious about each other

354
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,958
I think it's time that you go

355
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,125
Do you want to miss your flight?

356
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:00,667
Kaira I'm serious, I'm not kidding

357
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,833
We really should...

358
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,208
We have a flight to catch...

359
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,208
It's late

360
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,125
Okay 0K3}!

361
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:18,375
Go, it's okay, it's cool

362
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:19,333
Really?

363
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,000
You don't have anything to say?

364
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:26,417
No, that's it for now

365
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:27,958
Bye

366
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,167
What did I miss?

367
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:33,167
Shots!

368
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,542
<i>So, let's break up</i>

369
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,500
<i>Oh my dear</i>

370
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,250
<i>Let's break up</i>

371
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:16,667
<i>Oh please say yes</i>

372
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,250
<i>You and I will never work out,
oh let me go</i>

373
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,833
<i>When I see</i>

374
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,917
<i>A beautiful girl</i>

375
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:45,500
<i>I get excited</i>

376
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,042
<i>Basically basically basically</i>

377
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,042
<i>I'm a rascal</i>

378
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:56,250
<i>But you're no less baby</i>

379
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,250
<i>Somedays you're nice</i>

380
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,875
<i>Somedays you're crooked</i>

381
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,542
<i>Basically basically basically...</i>

382
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:06,042
You're a rascal too

383
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:34,375
Koko, why don't you think
seriously about Raghuvendra?

384
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:37,875
He is so right for you...

385
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:41,875
This is why some
people should not drink

386
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,958
Why should she think
about Raghuvendra?

387
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,625
Is he the last man in the world?

388
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,958
Why shouldn't she consider him?

389
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:55,458
I will tell you point by point why
Raghuvendra is the perfect guy for Koko

390
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,417
Point no. 1...

391
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,375
And this is the most
important point in the world

392
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:04,292
He is good looking

393
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,958
Hardly two percent of people
in the world look good...

394
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,625
and if you have to spend
your life with somebody...

395
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:16,917
every morning you should
at least see a handsome face

396
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,917
Point no. 2...

397
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,833
He has a great sense of humour...

398
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:26,542
and more laughter means more sex

399
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:29,500
Where are you getting
this information?

400
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,917
Point no. 3...

401
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:36,167
He understands your profession

402
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,625
If you marry a software
engineer or a farmer...

403
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:43,958
what will you discuss at dinner?

404
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,250
Virus or cow dung?

405
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,125
Hello, my husband
is a software engineer

406
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,458
And we have many
interesting discussions

407
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,042
Like what?

408
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,958
Like a lot of things

409
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:56,375
And I'm sure farmers
are interesting too...

410
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:58,875
they can tell us
about organic vegetables

411
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:01,500
They can tell you
where to get cow's milk

412
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,292
Go, marry a farmer

413
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,875
Ganju, tell them I'm right

414
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:09,917
Yes, please give us
your male point of view

415
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:12,500
Guys, just shut up

416
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,250
This is all pointless

417
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:19,458
He's going to meet his
ex-girlfriend in New York

418
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:23,625
Ex-girlfriend! That's just great

419
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,042
Ex is an ex, that's in the past

420
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:28,917
Just punch her

421
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:32,375
No, the important question is...

422
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:36,833
are you his present?

423
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,458
William Faulkner once said...

424
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:44,417
"The past is never dead,
in fact it's not even the past"

425
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:47,875
What?

426
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:49,250
Your 'BD' taught you this?

427
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:51,875
Hey I want to go to this 'BD'

428
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,208
<i>Raguu!</i>

429
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,458
Take it take it...

430
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,208
No I don't need it

431
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:29,542
<i>Stop acting pricey...
I know you like Raguu</i>

432
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,917
No, I don't

433
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:38,042
Take it, keep it, very tasty so yum

434
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:40,292
Yuck Jackie, so cheap

435
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,625
<i>I love the taste of Raguu</i>

436
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,750
Have you gone mad?

437
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,333
Limited offer, grab now

438
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,042
You've gone mad

439
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,208
Pasta!

440
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:16,042
<i>No don't be so desperate,
let him call</i>

441
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,500
New photo?

442
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,833
Yes, nice?

443
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,167
Eat quickly, it will get cold

444
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:40,167
<i>Raguu Raguu Raguu...</i>

445
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,083
Just crush the blacks

446
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,083
More...

447
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:49,792
See...

448
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,458
Let's play

449
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,292
Much better see...

450
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:02,500
Yes, it's looking nice

451
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,167
Okay now pause and zoom in

452
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,542
Ganju! I told you to remind me at 3 PM

453
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,917
I had to take Fatty to the doctor

454
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:16,083
Fatty! I'm so sorry, I'm just leaving

455
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:20,458
<i>No, you wait I'm coming there,
to eat the canteen Vada Pav</i>

456
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,417
My doctor's appointment got cancelled

457
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,167
This landlord...

458
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,083
Hello...

459
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,833
What?

460
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,500
You are not going to believe this

461
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,375
Being single is now a crime!

462
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,417
What?

463
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:46,875
My landlord is kicking
me out of my apartment!

464
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:47,917
What?

465
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:50,833
I'm going to join the
ranks of homeless in Mumbai

466
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,875
And you want to know why?

467
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:54,583
Did I damage the apartment? No!

468
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:56,500
Did I forget to pay rent? No!

469
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:59,208
The building committee
just got together and decided...

470
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,083
that only married couples
and families can live there

471
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:02,250
Is that even legal?

472
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,083
This just happened?

473
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,083
Yes he just called!

474
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,417
I've been avoiding his calls for days

475
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:11,292
Gosh Fatty, I have to vacate
by the end of the month...

476
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,208
I don't know what to do

477
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:13,792
Damn these people

478
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:17,833
Mumbai, India's most
modern cosmopolitan city

479
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,333
Seriously

480
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:23,333
Listen, you know you can stay with me

481
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:26,250
That's not the point

482
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,167
In a way, thank God...

483
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,083
thank God I'm leaving this city
and this country for this project...

484
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,208
But seriously what thinking

485
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:40,042
No marriage means no home for women?

486
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:45,625
Why don't they make this law instead 'no
staying with your in-laws after marriage'?

487
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:50,000
Forget it

488
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So, when is the New York shoot?

489
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,500
I don't know

490
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,500
I will know the exact
dates in a month...

491
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,500
when the man returns

492
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,167
The man has not called?

493
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,875
Raghuvendra has not called?

494
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,333
No

495
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,833
What 'hmm'?

496
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,750
Why you looking so suspicious?

497
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,542
Fatty? Tell me

498
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,458
He got engaged

499
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,542
He sot engaged!

500
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:31,167
I'm sorry, who got engaged?

501
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,167
Raghuvendra

502
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,042
When?

503
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,042
Last week

504
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,625
Last week?

505
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,500
He was just here,
I mean, he just left...

506
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,500
I know...

507
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,792
Who told you? How do you know?

508
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,125
Ajay, that guy from production...

509
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,500
Just one second...
he's not even messaged...

510
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,250
Who told you?

511
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:58,417
Ajay, from production,
he went to New York with Raghuvendra

512
00:34:58,418 --> 00:35:00,208
He sot engaged?

513
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,083
I don't believe this to whom?

514
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,458
Just please, one second, how can he?

515
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,292
Koko...

516
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:10,542
God! This is just getting worse

517
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:32,833
You Okay?

518
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:34,792
It's just the chilli

519
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,667
You want to know to whom?

520
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:48,625
No

521
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:01,333
Okay playback

522
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:24,833
Sorry it slipped

523
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,125
<i>Where do I go from here</i>

524
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:47,083
<i>Where do I hide</i>

525
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,958
<i>This half heart</i>

526
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,083
<i>How do I share?</i>

527
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,042
<i>I've parted from myself</i>

528
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,958
<i>I'm separated from myself</i>

529
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,917
<i>This half heart</i>

530
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,667
<i>How do I settle?</i>

531
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,458
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

532
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,083
<i>Oh lying heart</i>

533
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,042
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

534
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,042
<i>What's your problem</i>

535
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:28,167
<i>Oh heart, just go to hell</i>

536
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:35,500
<i>Just go to hell, Oh heart</i>

537
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:55,458
<i>Just go to hell, Oh heart</i>

538
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,125
I don't believe this

539
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:00,917
Back to Goa, back to square one

540
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,167
It's just for 1 month...

541
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:06,333
then the New York shoot will start...

542
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,417
won't it?

543
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:09,958
I don't know...

544
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,375
Personal and professional...

545
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:16,542
always keep it separate

546
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,375
You always say this

547
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,083
When will you ever use this?

548
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,875
Such strange things you buy

549
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:25,333
Damn, I have to live
with my parents for a month

550
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,917
How am I going to do it?

551
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,708
Stay with me...

552
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,375
I'm also going to be in Goa

553
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,125
We'll do yoga together

554
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:35,125
Do yoga in your fancy holiday house...

555
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:39,125
I wish my parents would
buy me a villa in Goa

556
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:40,625
Guess what?

557
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:45,292
When I reach Goa, I have
to do a beautiful shoot for my dad

558
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,042
Uncle also joined the film business?

559
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:49,458
No Jackie...

560
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:52,958
he wants me to shoot a promotional
video for his friend's restaurant...

561
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:53,750
Who knows?

562
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,250
This could be the
turning point in my life

563
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:08,667
<i>Are you my fault</i>

564
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:11,083
<i>Or your own mistake</i>

565
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:14,042
<i>Shamed heart</i>

566
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,417
<i>Please tell me so</i>

567
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,125
<i>What do we gain now</i>

568
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,167
<i>What do we lose now</i>

569
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:26,083
<i>Shamed heart</i>

570
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,333
<i>Crying is no use</i>

571
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:32,208
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

572
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:41,167
<i>Oh lying heart</i>

573
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:46,625
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

574
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:49,667
<i>What's your problem</i>

575
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:53,292
<i>Oh heart, just go to hell</i>

576
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,458
So Koko

577
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,375
Have you met 'Salman Khan' yet?

578
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,500
Oh my God, 'Sallu'!

579
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,542
Is he so handsome in real life?

580
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:05,167
Does he actually have a 6 pack?

581
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,583
Or is that just how
it looks on screen?

582
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,417
Tell me Koko, I'm dying to know

583
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,583
First of all,
I haven't met your 'Sallu'...

584
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:13,917
and if I ever meet him...

585
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,042
I'm not going to tell him...

586
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:18,667
'Take off your shirt
I want to see your 6 pack abs'

587
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:19,417
Exactly

588
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,333
Tell us about your ad with 'Dhoni'

589
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:24,583
One second dad

590
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,208
'Salman Khan'? Abs? Really?

591
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,958
Stop bugging her...

592
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,375
talk about the main topic

593
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:45,417
Yes Ashu,
she should be doing a proper job...

594
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,042
in an office...

595
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,958
something more respectable

596
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:53,333
That's when we can talk to
people seriously about marriage

597
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,292
Why will she do some other job?

598
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,125
She's done a cinematography
course in New York

599
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,167
She is brilliant at her
job and she's still young

600
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,042
She won't be young forever...

601
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:06,458
all the good boys will be taken

602
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,417
That's my biggest worry you know...

603
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,750
come baby...

604
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:22,208
So Kaira, tell me...

605
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,750
Are you a...

606
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,708
Are you a Lebanese?

607
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,875
It's not 'Lebanese', it is lesbian!

608
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:42,333
Yes, are you a 'Lesbian'?

609
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,292
Oh my God...

610
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:58,750
If I were, would that stop
you from talking about marriage?

611
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:02,833
Even if you are,
it won't make a difference...

612
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,500
all this gay stuff is
cool in the film industry

613
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,167
You're right...

614
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:09,500
from big stars to spot boys,
everyone's gay...

615
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,250
we call it 'Gollywood' now

616
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,542
Really?

617
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:14,208
Really?

618
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:15,958
Of course not!

619
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,375
Do you people even
listen to yourselves?

620
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,083
It's such rubbish

621
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:24,292
The film industry doesn't have more
gay people, it's just more accepting...

622
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,875
there must be many gay
people in your office too...

623
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,875
but sadly they have to hide the fact

624
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,375
So, are you?

625
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:41,875
A <i>'lesbo'?</i>

626
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:47,833
No, unfortunately not

627
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:52,375
So why don't you settle down?

628
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:55,208
We're just worried about you Koko

629
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,250
If you keep hanging
with these filmy men...

630
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,375
how will you find a nice boy?

631
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:05,333
Filmy men are okay for checking
out abs, but not okay to marry?

632
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,083
How much junk you keep eating

633
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,417
I've made all this for you...

634
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:11,167
eat this

635
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:14,875
For me? Have you
ever seen me eat this?

636
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,500
<i>I thought you like paneer...</i>

637
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,375
you used to eat it...

638
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:24,792
that's why I keep
asking what you want...

639
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:26,333
anyway, dinner is put...

640
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:31,458
come baby, come...

641
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,417
You know Koko

642
00:43:43,418 --> 00:43:47,000
getting married before 25...

643
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,958
can reduce the divorce rate by 50%

644
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,083
There is a 100% chance
of not getting a divorce...

645
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,042
...by not getting married

646
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm going to stay with Jackie

647
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,958
Koko?

648
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:15,458
<i>I'm addicted to pain</i>

649
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:20,917
<i>Even my tears, laugh at me</i>

650
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:26,417
<i>Why do I give myself new scars</i>

651
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:32,958
<i>Somebody save me from myself</i>

652
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,875
What about the New York project...

653
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,625
What is this question,
'did you sleep well'?

654
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:28,458
If I say no what can you do?

655
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,042
I don't care what people think...

656
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:33,333
I'm not going to stay
with you for other people...

657
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:37,125
don't irritate me please

658
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:39,958
'Good morning' is it?

659
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,042
Now it's a 'good morning'...

660
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,708
If your night is not good...

661
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,708
how will your morning be good?

662
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,667
I think I should
be a night watchman...

663
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,125
Should I take an
appointment with a doctor?

664
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:57,208
Who is that?

665
00:45:57,209 --> 00:46:01,792
He moved here a few weeks ago,
to write...

666
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:04,417
Nice gUY

667
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,583
Take an appointment with him

668
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,417
There she is, my talented daughter...

669
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:14,500
She shoots with all
'Bollywood' celebrities

670
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:14,958
Really?

671
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,917
I know this is a small job for you...

672
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:21,417
but this new restaurant
video is very important for us...

673
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:22,875
thank you so much for doing this

674
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:23,958
No, it's cool

675
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,750
Actually we should start,
the camera setup will take a while

676
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,292
Yes, she is very professional

677
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:31,833
During work, only work, nothing else

678
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:32,667
Dad!

679
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:35,125
Can we stop all these
useless formalities?

680
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,083
I need to get this done

681
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,500
I only have a day

682
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,250
Get the 24-70

683
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,792
Tried everything Ganju...

684
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:45,417
even sleeping pills, nothing works

685
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:49,250
Try 'Reiki'...
my grandmother also tried it

686
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,667
Shut up and setup

687
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,208
Remove all this,
what's all this rubbish...

688
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,208
I am sorry,
this can't be moved right now...

689
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,875
only after this session ends

690
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:03,750
What?

691
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:06,292
We have to wait? Then why call us?

692
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:07,625
Ma'am, the session is going on

693
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,083
Madness!

694
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,583
National Convention for
Mental Health Awareness...

695
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,667
it's a festival for therapists...

696
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,500
Raunak's playground...should we go in?

697
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,083
Shut up and sit

698
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:23,208
Here?

699
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:24,167
Just sit

700
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,958
I've done a shot breakdown,
you want to see?

701
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:38,333
I'm sleeping

702
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:41,833
<i>Dr. Chopra,
therapy, counselling, analysis...</i>

703
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:43,292
<i>so many big terms...</i>

704
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,333
<i>what do they actually mean?</i>

705
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:51,458
<i>A proper map can be drawn after defining
commonly accepted medical terms...</i>

706
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:55,500
<i>if your problem or illness
falls in those definitions...</i>

707
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:58,208
<i>your prognosis will
tell you your diagnosis</i>

708
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,708
<i>It will become clear whether you need
intensive therapy or counselling...</i>

709
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,667
<i>whether you need an
analyst or psychiatrist...</i>

710
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:06,958
<i>it's quite simple actually</i>

711
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,333
It's very simple

712
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,292
What are they talking
how to understand?

713
00:48:11,293 --> 00:48:15,208
<i>Dr. Pereira, how does one decide which
type of doctor they should be going to?</i>

714
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:16,833
<i>A psychiatrist or a psychologist?</i>

715
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,750
<i>Each model has it's own
strengths and weaknesses...</i>

716
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:23,292
<i>an individual may find one approach
more appropriate than another...</i>

717
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:25,833
<i>depending on his
personal preferences...</i>

718
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,833
<i>and the depth and severity
of the problem presented</i>

719
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:32,125
If I hear another minute of this...

720
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,458
I'll go nuts

721
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:34,875
<i>This question is for Dr.Khan</i>

722
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:39,500
<i>Dr.Khan, how do you know
if someone is crazy or normal?</i>

723
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,375
What?

724
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,667
<i>Take me for example...</i>

725
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:45,208
<i>many of you might
think that I'm crazy...</i>

726
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:50,292
<i>I've come for this formal
seminar in these torn jeans...</i>

727
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,625
<i>so, am I crazy?</i>

728
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:58,500
<i>Or maybe all I need is a good stylist</i>

729
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:02,208
Crazy! Very scary word

730
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,625
Because here we still believe that...

731
00:49:05,417 --> 00:49:08,375
a problem of the mind
is something to be ashamed of

732
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:11,458
If you have a problem with your body,
that's normal...

733
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:12,917
you can tell everyone...

734
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:16,083
'hey I'm in hospital...

735
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,250
with a kidney failure...

736
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,750
lung infection, jaundice'

737
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,792
But if it's a problem of the mind...

738
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:27,208
then the whole family goes silent...

739
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,917
hush hush hush...

740
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,667
as if the mind is not
even a part of the body

741
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,500
Don't laugh just yet...

742
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,833
the joke begins now

743
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:47,458
Here in Goa,
my parents used to tell everyone...

744
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:51,458
that I'm a gynaecologist,
not a psychologist

745
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:54,833
Which means the doctor's
own family is ashamed...

746
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:58,625
to admit that their son is a therapist,
dealing with problems of the mind

747
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,417
Imagine my plight...

748
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:08,375
many of my pregnant relatives landed
up at the clinic for a free check up...

749
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:12,500
and you know what,
I delivered a few babies too...

750
00:50:12,501 --> 00:50:14,667
for the extra pocket money

751
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:16,792
No, I'm just kidding

752
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:26,917
Dr. Jehangir Khan

753
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,208
Thank you

754
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:06,000
You'll close it please?

755
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,000
So I'm Jehangir Khan...

756
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,750
but you can call me 'Jug'

757
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,042
May I have a glass of water...

758
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:36,500
from that jug, Jug?

759
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:41,708
<i>I'm sure you can
crack better 'yokes Kama</i>

760
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,625
May I call you Kaira?

761
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:47,583
I have only one name

762
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,958
So, how does this work?

763
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,625
I have no idea how that works...

764
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:02,167
you tell me

765
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,750
Can I lie down here?

766
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:07,500
Why, are you sleepy?

767
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm not able to sleep

768
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,083
That's the reason I am here

769
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,375
Did you see a doctor?

770
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:16,917
Isn't that what I'm doing?

771
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:21,750
You mean the white coat,
stethescope, pill-giving doctors...

772
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:24,292
I tried pills, they didn't work

773
00:52:24,293 --> 00:52:25,708
That's why I'm here

774
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:32,083
Sometimes I use this to
knock my patients off to sleep

775
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,833
You're funny

776
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:36,125
But, you need to work on your jokes

777
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:39,167
So tell me

778
00:52:40,292 --> 00:52:44,750
Any major change in your life?

779
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,042
I just moved from Mumbai to Goa...

780
00:52:49,043 --> 00:52:49,958
is that a major change?

781
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,375
Yes that's a major change...and?

782
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:57,792
And nothing,
the moving out, the settling in...

783
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:01,667
Or the leaving, the unsettling?

784
00:53:01,668 --> 00:53:04,083
No, that's not a problem for me...

785
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:07,083
I like to move,
not being in one place...

786
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,833
in fact I love to travel...

787
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:12,000
it's just this sleeping problem

788
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:16,917
So why did you move
from Mumbai to Goa?

789
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,083
You know...

790
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:31,958
I came to Goa to be
with my best friend...

791
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,458
she's having issues with this guy...

792
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:41,708
who she really likes,
really 'liked'...

793
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:46,375
and she thought he liked her too...

794
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,875
but then he suddenly
got engaged to someone else

795
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:52,750
So your best friend, is she okay now?

796
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:56,250
I don't think so...

797
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,792
I don't think she is okay

798
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:02,292
I think her main problem
is her profession

799
00:54:02,293 --> 00:54:05,875
She got this dream job,
which is linked to him...

800
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:09,000
his new fiancé will
also be on this project

801
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:11,542
So how will she handle that?

802
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,250
I don't know

803
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:14,833
What if everything gets messed up?

804
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,667
I don't know what to advise her...

805
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:19,875
should she just deal with it?

806
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:22,292
It is her dream job after all

807
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,000
Sometimes I feel I should tell her -

808
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:26,042
'Grit your teeth and just do it...

809
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:29,125
you won't get another
opportunity like this'

810
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,833
And sometimes I feel I should say -

811
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,167
'Shut up! And say no!...

812
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:33,792
don't you have self respect?'

813
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:37,500
So I don't know what to tell her

814
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:43,000
So you are not able to sleep,
because you are up all night...

815
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:48,792
wondering whether to tell
your best friend to shut up or not?

816
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:54,458
My grandfather used
to tell me a story...

817
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,542
please narrate it to your best friend

818
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:02,833
My grandfather was a mountain-climber

819
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:07,833
Before any expedition,
he would be thoroughly prepared

820
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:12,333
<i>Sadly, poor Pyarelalji
was not like this</i>

821
00:55:12,334 --> 00:55:15,125
<i>Who Pyarelalji?</i>

822
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:18,875
A very old friend of my grandfathers'

823
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,833
He was also a
mountain-climbing enthusiast...

824
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:25,083
whose life-long desire
was to climb the toughest peak...

825
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,125
Mt. Everest!

826
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,500
<i>Finally one day, Pyarelalji
got the chance to climb Mt. Everest...</i>

827
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:34,000
with a Chinese trekking
expedition group

828
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:39,708
Without thought or preparation,
he said yes and left

829
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:41,917
But the group was Chinese...

830
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:44,375
so they could speak only
in their own language...

831
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:46,125
no English Vinglish

832
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:49,625
So the trek began

833
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:54,125
As they slowly and
steadily climbed higher...

834
00:55:54,500 --> 00:56:01,417
<i>Pyarelalji paced ahead of
the group with much enthusiasm...</i>

835
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,667
while the Chinese people kept waving
from behind and shouting in Chinese...

836
00:56:04,668 --> 00:56:08,250
<i>'Don't go ahead! hatahau hatahau!'...</i>

837
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:12,292
<i>but Pyarelalji thought
they were cheering him on...</i>

838
00:56:12,293 --> 00:56:15,792
and saying 'go ahead,

839
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:17,542
You can speak Chinese?

840
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:18,917
Can you?

841
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:19,625
No

842
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,958
Then this works

843
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:22,125
Don't laugh, listen

844
00:56:22,417 --> 00:56:27,542
<i>Suddenly, Pyarelalji saw a growling
snow leopard in front of him...</i>

845
00:56:27,543 --> 00:56:31,500
<i>Pyarelal got scre***
I mean he got bloody scared</i>

846
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:33,958
Now he started waving his hands
frantically and shouting 'Help, Help!'

847
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:38,542
But the Chinese people
thought he is just happy

848
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:43,500
So he kept crying for help,
and they kept waving back

849
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,792
Then?

850
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:49,583
<i>Then the snow leopard
ate up poor Pyarelalji</i>

851
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:50,333
What?

852
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:51,000
Yes he was hungry

853
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:53,250
You don't find many
people on Mt. Everest...

854
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,667
And the group kept shouting...

855
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,667
'don't go ahead'

856
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,250
What a strange stow

857
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:03,208
No, it's not a strange story

858
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,833
Please tell your friend...

859
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:10,000
that sometimes we choose
the tough path only because...

860
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:13,083
we feel that to achieve
important things...

861
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,375
we have to take the tough path

862
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:20,417
We feel we need to punish ourselves...

863
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:23,333
but why?

864
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:26,792
Why not choose the easy way out?

865
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,667
What is so bad about it?

866
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:34,792
Especially when we are
unprepared for the tough path

867
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,042
Why climb mountains
when you are not ready to?

868
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:41,542
Excuse me

869
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:46,792
You will tell your
friend the story right?

870
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:49,875
It's important

871
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,375
Okay, <i>I</i> think...

872
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,333
My sleeping problem began...

873
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:09,125
when Raghuvendra got engaged

874
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,083
Raghuvendra?

875
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:12,417
The guy in my story?

876
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:15,125
Right, your friend's...

877
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,375
No, mine

878
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,792
At least I thought he was mine

879
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,083
We used to work together

880
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,000
Jack!

881
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,333
What are you doing here?

882
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,583
What are you doing here?

883
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:50,750
You don't answer my calls,
you moved here without telling me

884
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,917
Without telling you

885
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:53,625
Why would I tell you?

886
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,583
Who are you?

887
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,625
Actually I have one
thing to tell you...

888
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,125
I've made my decision

889
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,792
What decision?

890
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,625
Kaira, I have to talk to you...

891
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,750
Just shut up, one second

892
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,042
Listen to this story

893
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,875
This man wants to climb Mt. Everest...

894
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:18,125
but without any preparation
he leaves for Mt. Everest...

895
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:19,833
with Chinese companions...

896
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:21,833
and as he's about to fall...

897
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:24,542
the Chinese people don't understand...

898
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,833
obviously, because they are Chinese...

899
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:27,208
and they keep waving their flag...

900
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,417
and the man is stuck...

901
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:30,125
and then a tiger eats him up!

902
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,667
Got it?

903
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:42,000
The difficult option
is not the only option

904
00:59:42,001 --> 00:59:45,792
We can choose the easy option
also because the easy option is easy

905
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,208
You know, forget it

906
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:54,000
It's too much for your small mind

907
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:55,708
It's a very deep thought

908
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:59,542
Are you talking about
working on the film?

909
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:02,542
I was talking about
NOT working on the film!

910
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,125
That's my decision

911
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,667
Okay, okay good

912
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:08,083
Good?

913
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:10,500
Yes I think that's the best...

914
01:00:10,501 --> 01:00:11,792
You think?

915
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,667
Did you hear that?

916
01:00:13,668 --> 01:00:14,792
You think?

917
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:20,750
I have already taken the
decision to not work on your film...

918
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,792
What do you mean by 'you think'?

919
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,708
I guess someone really
does need therapy...

920
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,000
You told him?

921
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:31,875
No Koko

922
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:32,750
Him?

923
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:34,833
Yes, she told me, so?

924
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,958
And anyway why do you need therapy?

925
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,500
What's the big tragedy in your life?

926
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,542
You didn't want to get serious,
didn't want to commit

927
01:00:44,543 --> 01:00:47,208
So I don't understand,
what is the problem?

928
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:48,875
You don't understand?
- No!

929
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:49,917
Then get out

930
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:52,792
Oh God Kaira...

931
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,833
You really need to grow up

932
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:05,708
Good thing you've decided
not to work on my film...

933
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:09,542
I'm looking for mature
people to work with

934
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,792
What did I just say?

935
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,708
Get out right? Get out!

936
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:21,667
Bye, see you Jackie

937
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:24,042
I'm not mature enough to
handle your big fat project...

938
01:01:24,043 --> 01:01:26,375
but mature enough to sleep with you?

939
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:28,500
Amazing! What a revelation

940
01:01:28,501 --> 01:01:29,792
Kaira I came here to...

941
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:32,542
I don't want to do this, get out

942
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,208
What are you doing Kaira?

943
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:35,625
Just get out!

944
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:46,958
Koko, are you sure about this?

945
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,250
I know with all these
personal issues...

946
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:52,750
working with Raghu will be tough...

947
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,708
but this was your big break

948
01:01:57,292 --> 01:01:58,500
Okay Jack

949
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:04,250
Sometimes we choose
a tough path just because...

950
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:06,917
we believe that to
achieve important things...

951
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:10,125
we have to choose the tough option

952
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:15,875
But sometimes you need
to choose the easier option...

953
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:22,000
because at that time that
is the best option for you

954
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:24,208
Right?

955
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:29,792
Especially when you are
not ready to face that tough path

956
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,875
Damn! Wish I had said
it right when he was here

957
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,208
You want some tea?

958
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,542
Tonight I'm going to sleep so well,
so well...

959
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,292
Very well!

960
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:33,458
I was at this construction site...

961
01:04:33,459 --> 01:04:36,000
with all these construction workers...

962
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:38,958
all short and strange people

963
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,667
Suddenly, I lose my balance...

964
01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:45,875
and I go falling down...

965
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:48,208
this big fall...

966
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:50,792
and land in muck

967
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,875
I think it was a gutter

968
01:04:55,833 --> 01:05:00,917
All these workers are just staring,
but no one is helping...

969
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,250
I look up...

970
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,500
and I see my camera dangling...

971
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:10,500
and then suddenly out of nowhere...

972
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,875
this group of newly married women...

973
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:19,292
<i>in saris, pallus & bindis
all land up there...</i>

974
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:25,125
and they start pointing
at me, laughing at me

975
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:30,792
Bam! I woke up

976
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:32,417
It was 4 am...

977
01:05:32,418 --> 01:05:35,083
I went straight to the bathroom
and stood under the shower

978
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:36,792
Why shower?

979
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:39,333
I don't know

980
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:45,708
I felt dirty, I felt
like I needed to clean up

981
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:49,583
So this Raghuvendra,
he is tall and handsome?

982
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,292
That's your conclusion of my dream?

983
01:05:52,293 --> 01:05:53,833
Just asking

984
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,750
You know what I felt...

985
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:07,875
I felt I am ugly, trashy, cheap, dirty

986
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:08,667
That's funny

987
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:10,125
What's funny?

988
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,250
I mean...

989
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:19,250
all this from a girl who is
the opposite of ugly, trashy or dirty

990
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:24,000
That's funny... not "ha-ha" funny

991
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,375
<i>okay</i>

992
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:29,250
OOPs!

993
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:31,000
What's with this?

994
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:37,292
It only creaks when you really like
someone, but can't do anything about it

995
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:47,208
Yes, Raghuvendra is tall and handsome

996
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:53,250
So you like tall people,
not short and strange

997
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:56,875
Maybe...Sid was also tall

998
01:06:56,876 --> 01:06:58,583
So there's a Sid too?

999
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:00,000
Yes so?

1000
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:04,292
So I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1001
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:05,292
you will have admirers

1002
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,708
What do you mean?

1003
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,208
What do you mean by admirers?

1004
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,583
I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1005
01:07:10,584 --> 01:07:11,542
you will have admirers

1006
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:12,583
Admirers?
- Yes

1007
01:07:12,584 --> 01:07:14,042
You're trying to say
that there are lots of men!

1008
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:15,292
That's what you're trying to say

1009
01:07:15,293 --> 01:07:16,917
No, what do you want me to say?

1010
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,375
Why would I say that? No

1011
01:07:18,376 --> 01:07:19,542
That's what you are saying

1012
01:07:19,543 --> 01:07:24,125
You actually mean that I'm a fast girl, a cheap girl...
- No come on!

1013
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:25,583
Fast dirty cheap...

1014
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:28,458
...why use these words?

1015
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:30,042
Isn't that what the world thinks?

1016
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:34,583
If a girl has more than
one relationship then that's it!

1017
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:02,042
Kaira...

1018
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:04,958
have you ever bought a chair?

1019
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,042
What?

1020
01:08:06,043 --> 01:08:08,375
<i>A chair, kursi
have you ever bought one?</i>

1021
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:09,958
Yes

1022
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:13,875
And did you just go into a
shop and buy the first chair you saw?

1023
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,292
No

1024
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:17,750
Exactly my point

1025
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:21,917
We look at so many different
chairs until we find the right one

1026
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:26,250
Some chairs may be comfortable
but look like shit...

1027
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:28,875
others look nice but
are hard on the butt...

1028
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:33,958
So the process starts,
chair after chair...

1029
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:36,625
how many chairs we
check out before we find...

1030
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:39,583
that one chair!

1031
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:45,542
It doesn't creak with me

1032
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:52,708
If we look for so many
options just to buy a chair...

1033
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:54,917
then shouldn't we look at options...

1034
01:08:55,417 --> 01:08:57,333
when choosing a life partner?

1035
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:01,000
So...dirty cheap fast...no

1036
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:06,167
Smart clear fine...actually superfine!

1037
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:08,833
Wait wait wait

1038
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:13,042
So the women in my
dream who believe that...

1039
01:09:13,043 --> 01:09:17,000
marriage is the only
acceptable relationship...

1040
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:20,250
I felt dirty because of them

1041
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:25,042
See? You figured it out yourself...
you don't need anyone's help

1042
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:29,792
But the dangling camera?
What does that mean?

1043
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:34,000
Just like my future,
it's hanging in the air

1044
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:37,333
Maybe you should sit on my chair...

1045
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:40,792
and I should sit here from today

1046
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:43,958
It's so cool

1047
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:49,792
I wish the whole world could
hear about your chair theory

1048
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:55,542
Why is it important for
the whole world to hear this?

1049
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:57,417
No I just...

1050
01:09:57,792 --> 01:10:02,458
if they understand this chair theory
they will stop judging others...

1051
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:04,708
and what a beautiful world it will be

1052
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
No Kaira...

1053
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,625
when you understand yourself well...

1054
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:13,083
then what others think
of you doesn't matter

1055
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:22,708
If you don't take charge
of your own life somebody else will

1056
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:29,417
I pity those who don't shop for chairs

1057
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:35,792
Kaira, will you go
back to your chair please?

1058
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:39,458
Looked like you wanted
to take my chair home with you

1059
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:44,333
And speaking of home,
I have homework for you

1060
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:45,167
Homework?

1061
01:10:45,168 --> 01:10:47,458
Yes I'm very strict
with my homework assignments

1062
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:48,125
<i>okay</i>

1063
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,667
I want you to chat
with your mom and dad

1064
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:51,167
What!

1065
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,083
10 minutes with each please

1066
01:10:53,084 --> 01:10:54,792
Please, what will I say to them?

1067
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,417
Time's up, see you next week

1068
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,833
What! We have 20 seconds more

1069
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:04,292
Hey you saw that?

1070
01:11:05,792 --> 01:11:06,917
What happened?

1071
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:08,333
20 seconds happened

1072
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:13,500
I don't like this buzzer

1073
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,625
Homework Kaira

1074
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:21,417
Hey, those are really
nice looking glasses...

1075
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:22,792
Thanks

1076
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:26,417
You're going to see Jug?

1077
01:11:26,418 --> 01:11:28,833
Yup, I have an appointment

1078
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,375
Really?

1079
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:31,875
You have problems too?

1080
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:33,042
YUP

1081
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,167
lam going to get my cycle repaired

1082
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,208
Repairs cycles too?

1083
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:43,292
Hi dad

1084
01:11:43,293 --> 01:11:45,333
Hi darling, when will you come home?

1085
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,292
I'll come

1086
01:11:46,293 --> 01:11:49,000
You will be home before
Kiddo arrives right?

1087
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:52,042
There's enough time for that,
of course I'll be there

1088
01:11:52,043 --> 01:11:54,000
Your mom is in high spirits...

1089
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:56,000
full planning for the party

1090
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:59,333
Obviously, her prince is arriving

1091
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:03,708
Those restaurant guys
loved your film...

1092
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:05,708
They said it was very well shot

1093
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,333
Oh the hotel video

1094
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:09,292
<i>Close up of Prawn Balchao?</i>

1095
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:12,292
Anyway I'll call later

1096
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:13,375
<i>okay</i>

1097
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:14,750
Bye

1098
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,958
4 minutes!

1099
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:24,417
Yes Koko, you called?

1100
01:12:24,418 --> 01:12:26,708
Yes, why didn't you pick up
- I was cleaning Kiddo's room...

1101
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,458
I didn't have my phone

1102
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,792
Okay but I'm busy now,
can't talk bye

1103
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,125
<i>okay</i>

1104
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:36,458
Shift that!

1105
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:40,583
'Talk to mom and dad
for 10 minutes'...is he mad!

1106
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:53,833
Beach?

1107
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,333
Are we having the session out here?

1108
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,583
Why not? Problem?

1109
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:12,750
No, but is it allowed?

1110
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,708
Whose permission do I need?

1111
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:19,042
I don't know,
but aren't there some rules?

1112
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:22,833
Like privacy,
closed door, couch and all that?

1113
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:24,333
There are rules

1114
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:29,125
But one should know which
ones to break and which ones to not

1115
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:33,708
Now people will know I am crazy

1116
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,958
Who are these people
who keep following you?

1117
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:49,917
Despite the mess, Goa is
the most beautiful place in India

1118
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:52,917
I wish I could agree

1119
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:55,500
Why? You don't like Goa?

1120
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,417
I was born here

1121
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:03,417
This is where my parents live,
how can I like it?

1122
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,333
Did your homework?

1123
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:09,208
Only half...

1124
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,625
I managed to talk
to dad for 5 minutes...

1125
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:15,667
okay 4 minutes,
but that's a record in itself

1126
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:18,083
And your mom?

1127
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:21,167
I tried, but she was busy

1128
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,083
So you've only done a quarter

1129
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,833
What did you chat with your dad?

1130
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:29,208
About Kiddo, my brother...

1131
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:32,833
he's studying at
the London University...

1132
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,292
he's coming home soon, so
my parents are hosting a big party...

1133
01:14:37,293 --> 01:14:38,667
for his homecoming

1134
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:43,000
When I got here nobody
even said 'welcome'

1135
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,875
So you don't like Kiddo?

1136
01:14:45,876 --> 01:14:50,375
No no I love Kiddo, I really do

1137
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:53,958
He's the only one
who can make me smile...

1138
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:55,792
just by being there

1139
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:04,125
When he was little,
I would read him his favorite comic...

1140
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,167
<i>you know Tinkle, have you read it?</i>

1141
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:08,208
Yes

1142
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:13,542
<i>Hunter Shambhu,
Kaalia the Crow & Supandi...</i>

1143
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,583
<i>So Supandi! was Kiddo's favourite...</i>

1144
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:20,833
So <i>I would replace Supandi's
with Kiddo's name...</i>

1145
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,417
and read it to him

1146
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:26,375
He loved hearing the story in my voice

1147
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:30,167
Even today, he says it's
his best childhood memory

1148
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:33,792
And your best childhood memory?

1149
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,667
Come on, there must be something...

1150
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:44,875
I don't know

1151
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,833
What are your favourite childhood
memories?

1152
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:56,833
My dad used to bring
me here every Sunday...

1153
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:01,625
<i>To play Kabaddi with the sea</i>

1154
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,125
<i>Kabaddi with the sea?</i>

1155
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:15,333
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi</i>

1156
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:17,875
Go back!

1157
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:43,333
Just two more

1158
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:44,083
<i>okay</i>

1159
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:58,417
I can do this all daylong

1160
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:05,042
It's important that parents create
happy memories for their children

1161
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:08,208
Now I am a parent myself

1162
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,083
So I'm hoping...

1163
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:17,250
my son has at least
some happy memories...

1164
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:21,750
to tell his therapist

1165
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,958
He stays with his mom

1166
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:33,292
In divorce cases kids
usually end up with the mother

1167
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:44,167
I just regret not being
able to spend enough time with him

1168
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:56,167
I remember Shaira...

1169
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,875
my doll

1170
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:05,375
My dad's birthday gift to me

1171
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:11,125
When I used to live with my
grandparents, Shaira was with me

1172
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:18,250
I never played with her,
just kept her close to me

1173
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:25,042
At night,
I would hug her tightly and sleep

1174
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:39,833
You were shy?

1175
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,000
Yes

1176
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,042
How did you know?

1177
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:49,917
Shaira-Shy... I'm a genius, really

1178
01:18:49,918 --> 01:18:52,250
When I was little I was shy...

1179
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:55,042
dad used to call me Kaira-Shaira

1180
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,875
But now I'm fully Kaira

1181
01:18:56,876 --> 01:18:58,917
Kaira-Shaira, now fully Kaira

1182
01:18:58,918 --> 01:18:59,833
Yes

1183
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,875
Are you sure?

1184
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:10,542
Come on

1185
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:16,875
Listen tell me...

1186
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:20,000
why did you want me to talk
to Mom and Dad for 10 minutes?

1187
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:23,500
Is there some Chinese
mountain story behind this?

1188
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,375
Someday you'll have
to climb Mt. Everest right?

1189
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,667
Where is Shaira?

1190
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:00,417
Who Shaira?

1191
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:01,958
My doll!

1192
01:20:01,959 --> 01:20:03,667
The one dad gave me

1193
01:20:03,668 --> 01:20:06,083
How come you thought
of that doll all of a sudden?

1194
01:20:06,084 --> 01:20:07,292
Do you know where she is or not?

1195
01:20:07,293 --> 01:20:08,417
She may be in the storeroom...

1196
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:11,292
along with your and Kiddo's old things

1197
01:20:11,293 --> 01:20:13,292
What do you mean by maybe?

1198
01:20:13,293 --> 01:20:15,292
She must be there somewhere

1199
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:18,125
How will I remember
after all these years?

1200
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:23,083
Do you remember anything
at all about those years?

1201
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:27,833
<i>Taste this Bibik</i>

1202
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:29,375
<i>What is Bibik now?</i>

1203
01:20:29,542 --> 01:20:32,167
<i>Bebinca! Kiddo's favourite</i>

1204
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:33,625
No I'm leaving

1205
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:36,125
<i>I'm making coconut laddoos for you...</i>

1206
01:20:36,126 --> 01:20:37,083
your favourite...

1207
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,708
see I remembered

1208
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,875
You just want to make me fat!

1209
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,667
<i>Coconut laddoos!</i>

1210
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:52,292
I feel like breaking
a coconut on someone's head

1211
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:57,417
No, no violence, do deep breathing

1212
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,583
What memories will
parents leave behind?

1213
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:02,458
When they can't remember
anything themselves?

1214
01:21:02,459 --> 01:21:06,208
Let's drink to Shaira, wherever she is

1215
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:27,250
<i>In my street</i>

1216
01:21:27,251 --> 01:21:29,792
<i>The moon that appears</i>

1217
01:21:29,793 --> 01:21:32,125
<i>That brings Eid with it</i>

1218
01:21:32,126 --> 01:21:34,917
<i>Is that you?</i>

1219
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,417
<i>My mom</i>

1220
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:40,083
<i>Has made me a suit</i>

1221
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:42,333
<i>Has shown me a dream</i>

1222
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:44,375
<i>Is it of you?</i>

1223
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:47,458
<i>My heart is destroying
itself for someone</i>

1224
01:21:47,459 --> 01:21:49,208
<i>Who is it?</i>

1225
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:51,000
<i>It's you</i>

1226
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,667
<i>My heart is protecting
itself for someone</i>

1227
01:21:57,668 --> 01:21:59,375
<i>Who is it?</i>

1228
01:21:59,376 --> 01:22:01,333
<i>It's you</i>

1229
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:09,792
<i>Who is that so far away</i>

1230
01:22:09,793 --> 01:22:14,875
<i>Who is that so close</i>

1231
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:19,792
<i>Who is that so special</i>

1232
01:22:19,793 --> 01:22:21,750
<i>It's you</i>

1233
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:43,917
<i>The one for whom</i>

1234
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:48,792
<i>I'd break all other hearts</i>

1235
01:22:48,793 --> 01:22:51,458
<i>IS if you?</i>

1236
01:22:51,459 --> 01:22:54,125
<i>The one for whom</i>

1237
01:22:54,126 --> 01:22:56,708
<i>I'd go on living</i>

1238
01:22:56,709 --> 01:22:58,958
<i>I'd insure my loving</i>

1239
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:01,167
<i>IS if you?</i>

1240
01:23:01,168 --> 01:23:02,792
<i>The one who's presence</i>

1241
01:23:02,793 --> 01:23:04,000
<i>Makes all come alive</i>

1242
01:23:04,001 --> 01:23:05,750
<i>Who is it?</i>

1243
01:23:05,751 --> 01:23:07,625
<i>It's you</i>

1244
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:16,125
<i>Who is that so far away</i>

1245
01:23:16,126 --> 01:23:21,167
<i>Who is that so close</i>

1246
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:25,958
<i>Who is that so special</i>

1247
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,750
<i>It's you</i>

1248
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:36,042
<i>Who is in my verses?</i>

1249
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:41,417
<i>Who is in my poetry?</i>

1250
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:45,917
<i>Who is in my diary?</i>

1251
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:49,500
<i>It's you</i>

1252
01:23:58,875 --> 01:23:59,750
Hi!

1253
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:02,375
Oh hello...

1254
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:04,375
That was a beautiful song

1255
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:07,125
You have a beautiful voice

1256
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,208
You totally rocked it

1257
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:14,167
If your audience is so rocking,
the song has to match up

1258
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:17,958
I'm Jackie, this is Kaira

1259
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:22,583
And you are?

1260
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:24,958
Rumi

1261
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:26,417
Rumi?

1262
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,250
Girls night out?

1263
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:30,292
Yes

1264
01:24:30,293 --> 01:24:32,167
They are the best nights

1265
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,667
Hey, great song bro...

1266
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:37,917
<i>"you mum 'm.!</i>

1267
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:38,500
Did I?

1268
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:42,000
Killed who? We're all alive here

1269
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:45,417
Girls night, don't mind, cheers

1270
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:49,083
What a voice you have,
you should be singing in films

1271
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:54,250
Why only films?
There are all kinds of music...

1272
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:59,583
there is rock, pop, jazz, blues...

1273
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,292
do you like blues?

1274
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:05,625
Blues?

1275
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:08,542
You seem more red to me...

1276
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:12,583
What?

1277
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,583
<i>Vorresti fuggire con me?</i>

1278
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:20,292
That was Greek to me...

1279
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,875
It's Italian actually

1280
01:25:21,876 --> 01:25:25,667
Does that mean that I'm
so deadly and gorgeous...

1281
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:27,042
that you can't take your eyes off me?

1282
01:25:27,043 --> 01:25:28,542
Not at all

1283
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,375
It means that I'm heading to a private
beach with some of my friends...

1284
01:25:33,376 --> 01:25:34,833
to play some music

1285
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:38,542
Would you like to run away with me?

1286
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:53,833
Not bad

1287
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:52,583
Somebody seems to be
in a musical mood today

1288
01:26:56,125 --> 01:27:00,792
<i>"My heart is destroying itself
for someone, who is it? It's you"</i>

1289
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:03,042
Excuse me?

1290
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:11,708
<i>"Last night I went
out to listen to a band"</i>

1291
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,083
<i>"Which band was it,
where did you go where did you go?"</i>

1292
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:23,625
<i>"The name of the band I don't know
I don't know...but singer I know"</i>

1293
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:28,500
<i>So tell me more...
tell me more...tell me more</i>

1294
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,917
We didn't talk, only music

1295
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:34,750
What to tell?

1296
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,667
So what was his name? Banjo?

1297
01:27:37,668 --> 01:27:41,542
Or the fellow was called Cello?

1298
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,375
Rumi
- Wow!

1299
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:45,875
<i>My new kursi, my new chair</i>

1300
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:48,875
So, comfortable?

1301
01:27:48,876 --> 01:27:49,833
What?

1302
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:52,000
New chair, comfortable?

1303
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,542
Yes but it's a musical chair...

1304
01:27:56,543 --> 01:27:58,625
twenty four hours will
have to listen to music...

1305
01:27:58,626 --> 01:27:59,583
how to listen?

1306
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:03,583
Why don't you tell him straight,
that you like dialogue too

1307
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:07,125
How can you tell a musician
to stop the music and talk?

1308
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:09,833
He'll think I'm a musical idiot...

1309
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,958
have you ever felt like an idiot?

1310
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,333
I've sat through a
three hour Italian Opera...

1311
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,792
pretended it touched my heart...

1312
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:22,250
when every minute was torture

1313
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,917
I wanted to stand up on the chair
and scream even louder than them...

1314
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,792
<i>I'm an opera idiot!</i>

1315
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,583
Wow, okay

1316
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:37,875
What would you do if you
were dating an opera singer?

1317
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:40,042
I would say, 'Darling,
I will do anything for you...

1318
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:42,208
but don't make me hear the opera'

1319
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:45,042
Then end of story right?
She would dump you and run

1320
01:28:45,043 --> 01:28:48,167
Or after 6 months of suffering,
I would run away

1321
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:53,042
If one is going to suffer,
the other person should at least know

1322
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:56,083
What is the point
of suffering in silence?

1323
01:28:58,833 --> 01:28:59,833
See when...

1324
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:04,417
I'm so sorry - It's okay

1325
01:29:04,625 --> 01:29:05,792
I will get a new one for you

1326
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,583
I'll do it, don't touch it...

1327
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:11,833
I think it's safer to have
our sessions outdoor

1328
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:15,417
Go on, Rumi

1329
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,833
I like people who smell nice

1330
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:47,417
I hate smelly people

1331
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:49,000
Really? Why?

1332
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:51,833
So you like smelly people?

1333
01:29:52,042 --> 01:29:55,000
Everyone has a different smell...

1334
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:59,167
that's how people get
attracted to each other

1335
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:04,417
Eeks! Who goes around smelling
people to get attracted?

1336
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:06,125
Dogs

1337
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,583
Dogs

1338
01:30:10,917 --> 01:30:12,833
Ya dogs!

1339
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,625
Ganju, we should record
our conversations...

1340
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:19,833
they're true genius sometimes

1341
01:30:19,834 --> 01:30:20,417
Genius!

1342
01:30:20,418 --> 01:30:21,417
Yes please

1343
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:29,083
"Genius is not one
who has all the answers...

1344
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:36,625
genius is one who has the
patience to find every answer"

1345
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:39,417
Deep

1346
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:41,250
Which genius said this?

1347
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:43,875
Dr. Jehangir Khan

1348
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:45,875
Khan...khh

1349
01:30:45,876 --> 01:30:47,875
So does he smell nice?

1350
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:49,292
Who?

1351
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,083
There you go

1352
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,083
Wait let it breathe...cheers

1353
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:07,792
Listen to this bit

1354
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:10,125
I love chocolate

1355
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:11,750
Okay this bit

1356
01:31:20,833 --> 01:31:22,042
Wait one second

1357
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,583
Pink Floyd's first album,
you have to get this

1358
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:35,833
<i>"I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all"</i>

1359
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,625
<i>"I agree,
you find a place in every heart"</i>

1360
01:31:40,626 --> 01:31:42,042
You like strawberries?

1361
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:52,500
<i>"Yes you are a dream
your every move is a charm..."</i>

1362
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:58,042
<i>"but, you're not one
to be wooed by praise"</i>

1363
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:11,333
Try some?

1364
01:32:11,334 --> 01:32:13,833
Can we just have the music off please!

1365
01:32:17,042 --> 01:32:21,208
I'm sorry, I just need some silence

1366
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:30,750
Everything okay?

1367
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:34,417
I wrote this song for you

1368
01:32:35,167 --> 01:32:37,292
But it's okay,
silence is good sometimes...

1369
01:32:37,293 --> 01:32:39,583
there is beauty in silence too...

1370
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:41,875
let's be silent

1371
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:05,250
That's not silent

1372
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,333
I'm sorry

1373
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,917
Okay play your song

1374
01:33:14,918 --> 01:33:16,750
No forget my song...

1375
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,583
let's talk about you

1376
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:20,625
I want to know everything about you

1377
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:24,083
Come, sit

1378
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,625
Tell me about you

1379
01:33:26,626 --> 01:33:29,500
What was your first film about?

1380
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,625
When did you decide
to be a camerawoman?

1381
01:33:33,626 --> 01:33:34,667
What's your journey?

1382
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:39,958
You know, I haven't even
shot a selfie in my life

1383
01:33:40,792 --> 01:33:41,875
Isn't that funny?

1384
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:42,875
So tell me...

1385
01:33:42,876 --> 01:33:47,375
I want to know about your dreams,
your inspirations, your aspirations...

1386
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:49,167
I want to know everything about you

1387
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:53,667
Huh?

1388
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,375
What's going on?

1389
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:15,875
Shall I put on some music?

1390
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,375
Please

1391
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,875
I've heard enough for a lifetime

1392
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:24,875
So still suffering silently?
Or did you say it?

1393
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,917
I yelled it

1394
01:34:26,918 --> 01:34:28,083
So he ran away?

1395
01:34:28,084 --> 01:34:31,292
No, he was very sweet actually

1396
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:40,167
He stopped playing the song,
which he had composed for me...

1397
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:43,583
and began asking about me

1398
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:48,417
I felt guilty at first but...

1399
01:34:54,833 --> 01:34:59,583
Why are romantic
relationships so irritating?

1400
01:35:01,167 --> 01:35:05,250
With friends,
it's all so easy, it just flows...

1401
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:08,875
you don't need to make such an effort

1402
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:12,917
Who are the 5 people closest to you?

1403
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:14,333
Your top 5?

1404
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,125
Why?

1405
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:18,792
There is an important study...

1406
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:21,000
based on the size
of the human brain...

1407
01:35:21,001 --> 01:35:25,250
that shows that everyone has about
150 people in their whole universe

1408
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:29,042
The next cut is the 50 who
you would invite home for dinner...

1409
01:35:29,043 --> 01:35:33,458
then 15 who you turn to
in times of need for comfort...

1410
01:35:33,459 --> 01:35:38,500
and the final cut is of 5
people who are your whole world...

1411
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:41,167
your inner circle

1412
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,958
Who are your 5?

1413
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,333
Fatty, Kiddo, Jackie, Alka...

1414
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:58,083
Raghuvendra, no

1415
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:00,208
And I forgot to add...

1416
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,667
these 5 people can
also change with time

1417
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:08,875
That's true but these 4
people will always be on the list

1418
01:36:08,876 --> 01:36:12,667
Okay, so think of these 4 and tell me

1419
01:36:12,668 --> 01:36:15,292
How do you feel when
you are with them...

1420
01:36:15,792 --> 01:36:19,083
as compared to the changing 5th?

1421
01:36:19,084 --> 01:36:24,000
How, how do these
4 people make you feel?

1422
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:30,000
Special, I feel special I feel...

1423
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:34,208
important, I feel respected...

1424
01:36:34,209 --> 01:36:37,417
I feel happy and safe

1425
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:41,542
So you don't feel safe
with your boyfriends?

1426
01:36:42,292 --> 01:36:44,000
No...

1427
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:47,000
I feel safe but...

1428
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:52,833
I don't know it's not that

1429
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:55,417
With my friends...

1430
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:02,375
I feel free, I feel like myself

1431
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:04,917
Why safe?

1432
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:09,750
When you start liking a guy...

1433
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:16,042
What is your fear Kaira?

1434
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:25,792
It's back in one piece

1435
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,250
I believe broken things
can be put back together

1436
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:51,333
How is the 'Brain Doctor' going?

1437
01:37:51,334 --> 01:37:53,542
Is he married or single?

1438
01:37:53,792 --> 01:37:54,875
<i>Didi...</i>

1439
01:37:54,876 --> 01:37:56,708
Hi Alka!

1440
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,125
Look there

1441
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:02,292
<i>Didi...
how are you?</i>

1442
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,333
Rubbish

1443
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:06,917
Why did you go to the doctor?
Are you okay?

1444
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:09,042
I went to a 'Brain Doctor'

1445
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,750
What happened to your brain?

1446
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,958
Nothing, if you have an
emotional problem in your life...

1447
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:20,708
a 'Brain Doctor' can help you solve it

1448
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,917
Do such doctors exist?

1449
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:27,000
Then everyone should go to them

1450
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:29,542
Yes everyone should

1451
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:42,292
<i>I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all</i>

1452
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:50,417
<i>I</i> agree, you find
a place in every heart

1453
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:58,708
<i>Yes, you're a dream,
your every move a charm</i>

1454
01:38:58,709 --> 01:39:05,375
<i>But, you're not one
to be wooed by praise...</i>

1455
01:39:10,083 --> 01:39:11,833
Don't stop!

1456
01:39:11,834 --> 01:39:14,042
Come on, play the music

1457
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:31,833
<i>Heart...be silent</i>

1458
01:39:31,834 --> 01:39:34,417
<i>Don't beat so loud</i>

1459
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:42,250
<i>Let her not see
you suffer</i>

1460
01:39:43,542 --> 01:39:50,083
<i>You will smile now at my state</i>

1461
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:56,958
<i>But, you're not one
to be wooed by praise</i>

1462
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:18,625
<i>Should I whisper in your ears</i>

1463
01:40:18,626 --> 01:40:21,958
<i>Or scream from mountain tops</i>

1464
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,458
It was good fun

1465
01:40:27,459 --> 01:40:30,417
<i>We danced to Honey Singh
songs all night</i>

1466
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:31,708
What's happening?

1467
01:40:32,542 --> 01:40:33,542
Fatty!

1468
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:36,792
I called you, why didn't you answer?

1469
01:40:36,793 --> 01:40:38,833
<i>Hi Koks</i>

1470
01:40:40,542 --> 01:40:42,708
Why are you both grinning like that?

1471
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:46,083
Jackie is just telling
me about her new boyfriend

1472
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:47,292
What?

1473
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,958
Hello?

1474
01:40:48,959 --> 01:40:50,333
What new boyfriend?

1475
01:40:50,334 --> 01:40:51,500
How about telling me...

1476
01:40:51,501 --> 01:40:53,583
I'm right here, am I invisible?

1477
01:40:53,584 --> 01:40:54,708
You didn't even ask

1478
01:40:54,709 --> 01:40:56,000
Why do I have to ask?

1479
01:40:56,001 --> 01:40:57,000
Okay guys relax

1480
01:40:57,001 --> 01:40:57,958
How can you not tell me?

1481
01:40:57,959 --> 01:41:01,875
I know why, because it's
that weird guy at the bar right?

1482
01:41:01,876 --> 01:41:03,792
See this is what you do

1483
01:41:03,793 --> 01:41:04,917
You're always judging my men

1484
01:41:04,918 --> 01:41:06,875
I'm not judging,
you called him weird yourself

1485
01:41:06,876 --> 01:41:10,875
That was then, now I like him

1486
01:41:10,876 --> 01:41:13,875
But you didn't tell
me that you like him

1487
01:41:13,876 --> 01:41:16,125
Because you never asked,
you're not around

1488
01:41:16,126 --> 01:41:18,625
How am I supposed to
know if you don't tell me?

1489
01:41:18,626 --> 01:41:22,125
You keep doing this
and blame me for everything

1490
01:41:22,126 --> 01:41:23,875
I am around!

1491
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:27,125
Fatty where are you?

1492
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:31,083
Great you also leave me

1493
01:41:38,833 --> 01:41:40,958
Good morning!

1494
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:43,917
Good morning Jackie Chan

1495
01:41:45,875 --> 01:41:47,292
Anything special today?

1496
01:41:47,293 --> 01:41:48,333
Yes

1497
01:41:49,167 --> 01:41:50,208
You

1498
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:52,500
You're so special

1499
01:41:55,958 --> 01:41:58,167
Okay, I'm special

1500
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:10,375
So you fix cycles too?

1501
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,000
<i>L</i> try

1502
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,625
And if I can't fix them,
I recycle them

1503
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:21,125
Recycle a cycle?

1504
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:26,083
Kaira, you have to
crack better jokes please

1505
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:32,375
So all that cycle
art in your room and...

1506
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:34,833
HEY, hi by the way!

1507
01:42:35,625 --> 01:42:40,375
This boy was wearing those funky
looking glasses, you made all that?

1508
01:42:40,376 --> 01:42:42,125
Finally! You noticed

1509
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:43,583
He's an artist

1510
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:51,083
If you can't fix people
do you recycle them too?

1511
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,125
Bye Jug

1512
01:42:56,542 --> 01:42:57,958
Sorry about it

1513
01:42:58,875 --> 01:42:59,875
That's so mean

1514
01:42:59,876 --> 01:43:02,250
Yeah that's so mean, let's go

1515
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,417
Why Cycle today?

1516
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:09,417
Just breaking the pattern

1517
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:11,833
Yes, should break it

1518
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:16,375
You must be going insane
listening to crazy people like me...

1519
01:43:16,542 --> 01:43:18,250
all day inside one room

1520
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:19,333
Quite possible

1521
01:43:19,708 --> 01:43:20,875
Albert Einstein once said...

1522
01:43:21,208 --> 01:43:23,542
"An insane person is one who does
the same thing over and over again...

1523
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:25,792
and expects different
results each time"

1524
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:36,500
By the way, Rumi, it's over...

1525
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:37,792
Why?

1526
01:43:38,542 --> 01:43:40,500
Can't do it...

1527
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:43,042
it's too much

1528
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:45,583
He doesn't fit in my...

1529
01:43:46,042 --> 01:43:46,833
I don't know...

1530
01:43:46,834 --> 01:43:48,542
I can't handle it it's too much

1531
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:49,833
What's too much?

1532
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:50,875
Too much

1533
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:53,750
<i>Wait wait, Lance Armstrong</i>

1534
01:43:57,708 --> 01:43:59,833
Did Rumi do something wrong?

1535
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:04,375
No we were just wrong
for each other...

1536
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:06,083
Not this chair

1537
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:10,708
Shiver! Only happens
when we feel cold...

1538
01:44:11,042 --> 01:44:14,375
or have a fever, or due to weather...

1539
01:44:15,042 --> 01:44:18,375
or sometimes people shiver
when they are scared...

1540
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:28,042
I just want to be free...

1541
01:44:28,043 --> 01:44:30,333
free from all this

1542
01:44:30,875 --> 01:44:32,917
I also want you to be free...

1543
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:35,000
free from your fears

1544
01:44:35,208 --> 01:44:36,333
Free!

1545
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:38,625
Oh wow

1546
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:42,875
Help me

1547
01:44:44,417 --> 01:44:46,375
Damn, our time's up

1548
01:44:46,792 --> 01:44:47,167
What?

1549
01:44:47,168 --> 01:44:48,875
Got to go! Sorry

1550
01:44:48,876 --> 01:44:50,000
Jug!

1551
01:44:52,667 --> 01:44:54,500
Get my glasses please

1552
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,792
MY darling boy, all good?

1553
01:45:02,793 --> 01:45:04,042
Yes all good

1554
01:45:04,043 --> 01:45:07,375
Kiddo! Spend some time with me now,
not fair...

1555
01:45:07,376 --> 01:45:09,333
Sorry, I was getting ready...

1556
01:45:09,334 --> 01:45:11,208
you know it's my party,
I have to look nice

1557
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:12,250
You look nice

1558
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:15,667
So are you part of this matchmaking?

1559
01:45:15,668 --> 01:45:16,292
Me?

1560
01:45:16,293 --> 01:45:17,125
Yes you

1561
01:45:17,126 --> 01:45:21,000
I have no clue but
I want to see the fun

1562
01:45:21,542 --> 01:45:24,417
Sweet boy Kiddo

1563
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:28,875
And you,
is your best friend Jackie here?

1564
01:45:28,876 --> 01:45:31,958
Is she still single or...

1565
01:45:32,417 --> 01:45:37,083
Yes, she's still very
much single and so is Kaira

1566
01:45:37,833 --> 01:45:40,250
Please stop, it's starting to hurt

1567
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,000
<i>Kama, come</i>

1568
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:48,500
I want to introduce
you to a young man

1569
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,375
This is my niece, Kaira

1570
01:45:51,376 --> 01:45:53,417
Hi Kaira, Suresh

1571
01:45:53,418 --> 01:45:54,583
Suresh

1572
01:45:54,833 --> 01:45:55,708
Pleasure

1573
01:45:56,125 --> 01:45:57,542
Well I'll see you'll later then

1574
01:45:57,543 --> 01:45:58,917
Alright, cheers

1575
01:45:59,542 --> 01:46:00,292
Cheers

1576
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,708
So you're a photographer right?

1577
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:09,417
Cinematographer actually

1578
01:46:09,583 --> 01:46:10,833
One and the same thing

1579
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:12,167
No, it's not the same thing

1580
01:46:12,168 --> 01:46:12,958
It's not?
- No

1581
01:46:12,959 --> 01:46:13,750
<i>okay</i>

1582
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:16,167
What do you do?

1583
01:46:16,792 --> 01:46:17,875
I'm a techie...

1584
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:22,042
does that sound boring?

1585
01:46:22,043 --> 01:46:22,500
Fun

1586
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:25,375
It's fun, then cheers

1587
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:33,708
So, why should I be interested in you?

1588
01:46:35,542 --> 01:46:37,792
That was pretty direct right?

1589
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:46,333
I can be interesting
if I meet an interesting girl...

1590
01:46:47,333 --> 01:46:48,500
it depends

1591
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,125
<i>okay</i>

1592
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:54,250
See Kiddo, your favourite food

1593
01:46:54,458 --> 01:46:55,250
Thank you

1594
01:46:56,125 --> 01:47:01,167
What a sweet child Kiddo was,
never used to cry

1595
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:06,750
Never left my side, always 'Mama Mama'

1596
01:47:07,042 --> 01:47:09,375
Well I figured 'Mama Mama'...

1597
01:47:09,376 --> 01:47:13,625
was a better way to get
what I wanted than to cry

1598
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:16,750
How fast these kids grow up

1599
01:47:16,751 --> 01:47:17,333
I know

1600
01:47:17,334 --> 01:47:21,042
Look at Kiddo, he has achieved
so much at a young age

1601
01:47:21,583 --> 01:47:24,875
He has got a scholarship
for a higher degree...

1602
01:47:24,876 --> 01:47:27,917
then an internship with a big firm...

1603
01:47:27,918 --> 01:47:29,583
tell them the name
of the company, Kiddo

1604
01:47:29,584 --> 01:47:32,750
Dad, just stop it now

1605
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:36,042
You will definitely be successful

1606
01:47:36,292 --> 01:47:38,583
You are doing the correct thing

1607
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:43,417
You're not eating anything...

1608
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:45,292
are you dieting again?

1609
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:47,042
I don't feel like

1610
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:48,417
Eat something

1611
01:47:50,042 --> 01:47:51,917
Fine, give it to me

1612
01:47:52,292 --> 01:47:53,625
Here have this

1613
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:58,417
You remember Chanda,
Kiddo was such a gentle, quiet boy...

1614
01:47:58,792 --> 01:48:02,042
but Kaira, a real firecracker...

1615
01:48:02,043 --> 01:48:03,958
she's still the same

1616
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:05,875
Firecracker yes,
you're absolutely right...

1617
01:48:05,876 --> 01:48:10,292
anger, tantrums and sulking,
most of all with me

1618
01:48:10,667 --> 01:48:15,667
You kids have no idea how
tough it is to be a parent...

1619
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:19,375
and it's never ending

1620
01:48:19,667 --> 01:48:22,042
Once a parent always a parent

1621
01:48:22,043 --> 01:48:22,750
I agree

1622
01:48:22,751 --> 01:48:24,833
No holiday from this job, right Ashu?

1623
01:48:24,834 --> 01:48:26,833
<i>All parents should be awarded
a President's Award</i>

1624
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,000
Huh?

1625
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:29,083
I love the food

1626
01:48:30,542 --> 01:48:31,875
So end it then

1627
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:33,042
Just end it

1628
01:48:33,708 --> 01:48:34,417
What?

1629
01:48:34,418 --> 01:48:36,708
The job of being a parent, just end it

1630
01:48:38,042 --> 01:48:41,583
You keep going on and on about
how 'tough' it is, so just end it

1631
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:44,958
Who has forced you
to continue being parents?

1632
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,208
Has anyone forced you to?

1633
01:48:46,625 --> 01:48:51,458
You didn't start the job well in
the first place so why continue it...

1634
01:48:51,459 --> 01:48:52,958
just put an end to it!

1635
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:59,375
When kids need you the most
you happily leave them and go

1636
01:48:59,376 --> 01:49:01,333
and then complain
about their tantrums...

1637
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:04,417
'Oh how angry she gets, makes faces'

1638
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:08,875
It was your idea to
bring us into the world...

1639
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:11,292
you treated us the way you wanted...

1640
01:49:11,293 --> 01:49:15,167
and then you blame
us for how we behave...

1641
01:49:15,168 --> 01:49:15,958
and you say it's 'tough'...

1642
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:17,625
What do you mean by 'tough'?

1643
01:49:17,626 --> 01:49:18,750
Tough my foot!

1644
01:49:24,167 --> 01:49:25,583
How could you just abandon me?

1645
01:49:28,667 --> 01:49:30,083
How could you just do that?

1646
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:35,125
How could you just do that?

1647
01:49:35,417 --> 01:49:37,667
How could you both leave me and go?

1648
01:49:38,375 --> 01:49:42,167
And the only reason you took me back
was because I failed the 2nd grade...

1649
01:49:42,168 --> 01:49:44,042
yes, I failed the 2nd grade!

1650
01:49:44,043 --> 01:49:45,708
Shame Shame!

1651
01:49:45,709 --> 01:49:48,250
Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!

1652
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:51,000
Such an embarrassment for you...

1653
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:53,667
that you left everything
and came back to India?

1654
01:49:55,875 --> 01:50:00,375
And when I was finally happy
living with my grandparents,

1655
01:50:00,542 --> 01:50:02,292
you dragged me away from there too

1656
01:50:02,875 --> 01:50:03,917
You separated me even from them

1657
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:05,125
Yes

1658
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:08,083
<i>President's Award just for that!</i>

1659
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:14,208
And I have a firecracking
news for you!

1660
01:50:14,209 --> 01:50:15,792
Actually a bomb!

1661
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:17,125
Are you ready?

1662
01:50:17,667 --> 01:50:19,833
I have begun therapy!

1663
01:50:21,333 --> 01:50:24,083
Yes! I am seeing a 'Brain Doctor'

1664
01:50:24,375 --> 01:50:26,750
So feel free to call me crazy, mad

1665
01:50:26,751 --> 01:50:29,000
Please say it to me
right now say it to my face

1666
01:50:29,417 --> 01:50:30,292
Say it!

1667
01:50:30,293 --> 01:50:32,250
I'm crazy! 'Kukoooo'

1668
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:34,250
'Kaira's gone mad!'

1669
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:42,208
That's what you think...

1670
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:46,792
that people like me are crazy

1671
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:58,583
She is a bit emotional right now...

1672
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:01,667
she is also out of work

1673
01:51:01,668 --> 01:51:02,542
Dad, she has enough work

1674
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:05,958
She has chosen not to work right now

1675
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:13,625
Kiddo, go get her

1676
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:14,958
Don't worry

1677
01:51:14,959 --> 01:51:16,250
Make her understand that...

1678
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:19,792
once your parents moved back,
she never failed in school again...

1679
01:51:20,708 --> 01:51:24,000
so they took the right decision

1680
01:51:24,917 --> 01:51:26,833
There are all kinds of failures...

1681
01:51:28,458 --> 01:51:29,625
and I am looking at a few right now

1682
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:03,125
You Okay?

1683
01:52:05,292 --> 01:52:06,500
I don't know

1684
01:52:18,292 --> 01:52:20,208
Were you happy as a child?

1685
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:23,208
I only remember being
happy once you came home

1686
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:31,375
See this

1687
01:52:33,667 --> 01:52:35,375
Where did you find that?

1688
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:38,042
I was looking for
something from my past...

1689
01:52:38,917 --> 01:52:40,250
and found something from ours instead

1690
01:52:53,958 --> 01:52:54,708
You know...

1691
01:52:55,083 --> 01:52:58,792
As children, when we are sad,
our elders tell us not to cry

1692
01:52:59,083 --> 01:53:02,083
When we are angry,
they tell us 'give us a smile'

1693
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,125
You know why?

1694
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:06,875
Just to keep the peace at home

1695
01:53:07,375 --> 01:53:10,333
When we wanted to hate
they didn't allow us...

1696
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:12,792
so now when we want to love...

1697
01:53:12,793 --> 01:53:17,417
we suddenly find our whole
emotional system is topsy-turvy...

1698
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:19,792
it cannot function

1699
01:53:21,083 --> 01:53:22,792
Sadness, anger, hate...

1700
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:25,208
we were not allowed
to express anything...

1701
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:27,958
so now, how do we express love?

1702
01:53:34,833 --> 01:53:38,958
It's okay to be angry sometimes,
even with parents...

1703
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:40,833
It's good, it's healthy...

1704
01:53:41,542 --> 01:53:43,875
it's okay Kaira...

1705
01:53:58,125 --> 01:54:02,583
They left me at my grandparents' house

1706
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:09,333
Mom told me this was like a vacation,
that I would join them soon

1707
01:54:12,792 --> 01:54:17,375
Dad's export business
in Goa had failed...

1708
01:54:18,458 --> 01:54:24,167
so he went to Africa, Middle East
looking for business opportunities...

1709
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:25,625
mom went with him

1710
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:33,083
In the beginning I was happy
staying with my grandparents...

1711
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:35,708
in their big old house in Vasco

1712
01:54:54,083 --> 01:54:56,917
I would write a letter
to mom and dad every week...

1713
01:54:58,667 --> 01:55:00,042
sometimes even twice a week

1714
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:09,792
At that age, 'writing'
meant drawing some pictures...

1715
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,417
trying to write some big words...

1716
01:55:15,042 --> 01:55:18,625
but every letter ended
with the same question...

1717
01:55:21,458 --> 01:55:22,875
'When will you come back?'

1718
01:55:27,417 --> 01:55:28,292
I was 5 years old...

1719
01:55:30,208 --> 01:55:34,792
every week I would drop my letters
in the mailbox with my grandad...

1720
01:55:35,125 --> 01:55:38,417
then I would wait for a letter

1721
01:55:39,417 --> 01:55:41,333
wait for an answer to my question...

1722
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:48,458
but it never came

1723
01:55:51,583 --> 01:55:56,500
When they called once a month,
they had some excuse each time...

1724
01:55:58,542 --> 01:56:03,708
something about 'an address change, no
post office close by, feeling unwell' etc etc

1725
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:08,208
but I still kept writing

1726
01:56:10,958 --> 01:56:12,958
And my grandad would keep
walking me to the mailbox...

1727
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:17,833
he always said that I will
get my answer some day soon

1728
01:56:21,667 --> 01:56:25,000
Then, a year later
mom visited me in Goa...

1729
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:30,458
with my new baby brother, Kiddo

1730
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:35,458
I was jealous

1731
01:56:37,958 --> 01:56:41,792
Because he got to be with
mom all the time, and not me

1732
01:56:44,667 --> 01:56:50,208
then mom said that I would be away
from them for 'just a little longer'

1733
01:56:52,208 --> 01:56:53,625
so I was still fine with it...

1734
01:56:56,042 --> 01:56:59,542
I remember asking my
mom if she got my last letter

1735
01:57:01,042 --> 01:57:05,792
she said that it was so beautiful that
she put it up on the refridgerator...

1736
01:57:05,793 --> 01:57:07,167
so that she could see it every day

1737
01:57:07,667 --> 01:57:09,125
I was so haPPY---

1738
01:57:10,875 --> 01:57:15,167
I ran to my room so I could
write another letter for her...

1739
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:19,083
so I could see her get
happy in front of my own eyes

1740
01:57:19,458 --> 01:57:22,375
A scene I had imagined
in my head many times

1741
01:57:23,542 --> 01:57:27,292
So I took out my colours and paints...

1742
01:57:28,042 --> 01:57:33,208
drew a picture and
ran to show it to her

1743
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:38,583
As I was about to enter the room I
heard my grandad shouting at my mom...

1744
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:43,458
he was telling her that what
she was doing was not right...

1745
01:57:43,667 --> 01:57:45,292
how could she not respond
to my question, to my letters...

1746
01:57:46,375 --> 01:57:49,250
and then, I heard my mom reply...

1747
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:56,167
"I can't give her false hope...

1748
01:57:57,917 --> 01:58:02,208
the truth is that we can't
take her back just yet...

1749
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,292
not until the business is set up...

1750
01:58:06,333 --> 01:58:08,542
It is too tough to
handle two children...

1751
01:58:09,875 --> 01:58:12,333
and travel constantly blah blah

1752
01:58:14,625 --> 01:58:15,833
But everything just seemed to...

1753
01:58:17,292 --> 01:58:17,917
fade away...

1754
01:58:25,375 --> 01:58:27,792
It was a strange feeling...

1755
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:36,042
like someone had grabbed
the TV remote from me...

1756
01:58:37,375 --> 01:58:43,208
and changed the channel from something
I loved to something horrid...

1757
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,667
and then threw out the remote

1758
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:56,833
I went back to my room,
tore up the letter...

1759
01:59:00,542 --> 01:59:01,375
I was 6...

1760
01:59:02,958 --> 01:59:06,125
took a decision as a 6 year old...

1761
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:12,292
that I had nothing more to
say to them, nothing more to ask...

1762
01:59:19,333 --> 01:59:21,292
I didn't write a letter
ever again in my entire life

1763
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:22,875
Never

1764
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:31,292
My poor grandad kept
trying to get me to write...

1765
01:59:32,875 --> 01:59:35,208
but I knew I had nothing
to say to my parents...

1766
01:59:37,625 --> 01:59:39,542
or to anyone else...

1767
01:59:42,417 --> 01:59:43,458
I just became quiet

1768
01:59:45,542 --> 01:59:46,458
I shut down

1769
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,542
Then a year later my mom said
that they were coming back for good...

1770
01:59:59,167 --> 02:00:03,417
dad's friend had a business
partnership for him in Goa itself

1771
02:00:05,542 --> 02:00:08,792
In all these years, dad couldn't
set up his business abroad

1772
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:14,250
So imagine, all this for nothing

1773
02:00:16,625 --> 02:00:17,875
So they came back

1774
02:00:19,917 --> 02:00:24,208
But that year was the
most stressful for me...

1775
02:00:27,417 --> 02:00:28,792
I didn't want to be with them

1776
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:33,167
I wanted to stay with my grandparents

1777
02:00:35,208 --> 02:00:36,792
They were separating me from them too

1778
02:00:38,958 --> 02:00:40,417
I threw tantrums...

1779
02:00:40,418 --> 02:00:43,792
cried a lot, troubled everyone

1780
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,542
To top it all,
I failed the 2nd grade...

1781
02:00:47,792 --> 02:00:51,917
and that, not my 100 letters...

1782
02:00:52,458 --> 02:00:56,583
not the fact that I was their
daughter living away from them

1783
02:00:57,125 --> 02:01:00,083
But my failure made them
take me away from my grandparents...

1784
02:01:00,667 --> 02:01:02,500
and back with them finally

1785
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:35,333
I'm sorry

1786
02:01:39,833 --> 02:01:41,417
I'm sorry

1787
02:01:45,208 --> 02:01:50,625
If you don't cry wholeheartedly,
how will you laugh wholeheartedly?

1788
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
It's okay...

1789
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,542
I'm not much for rules...

1790
02:02:03,543 --> 02:02:07,875
but because of the rules...

1791
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:14,542
I can't pop a champagne
bottle to celebrate this moment...

1792
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:17,792
but we can do the next best thing

1793
02:02:29,167 --> 02:02:30,875
To letters, Kaira

1794
02:02:30,876 --> 02:02:31,833
Cheers!

1795
02:02:34,667 --> 02:02:35,750
Go easy...

1796
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:54,417
To feel safe,
first the fears have to go

1797
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:58,500
The fear of being abandoned,
of being left alone...

1798
02:03:00,875 --> 02:03:04,125
You have carried this
fear with you all your life...

1799
02:03:05,458 --> 02:03:14,625
this burden is falling on all your
relationships, especially on your love life

1800
02:03:15,167 --> 02:03:18,875
So you leave others
before they can leave you

1801
02:03:19,375 --> 02:03:23,750
You want to say bye
before they can say bye

1802
02:03:25,792 --> 02:03:30,792
Because you never want
to face that pain again

1803
02:03:33,667 --> 02:03:35,125
<i>So, Kama</i>

1804
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:42,958
Why not say bye to
this fear once and for all?

1805
02:03:44,875 --> 02:03:50,250
Why not say hi to life once again?

1806
02:03:54,750 --> 02:04:00,042
I am not saying that you
should forgive your parents...

1807
02:04:00,292 --> 02:04:02,042
or even to stop being angry...

1808
02:04:02,043 --> 02:04:03,917
you do as you wish

1809
02:04:04,333 --> 02:04:05,667
But I will say this...

1810
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,833
try to look at them not in
the exalted status of parents...

1811
02:04:12,833 --> 02:04:15,250
but just as two regular people...

1812
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:22,792
who make mistakes, like everyone else

1813
02:04:23,958 --> 02:04:25,875
As a child it is hard
to understand all this...

1814
02:04:25,876 --> 02:04:27,750
but now, as an adult...

1815
02:04:28,083 --> 02:04:29,917
you can at least try

1816
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:40,750
Don't let the past blackmail your
present to ruin a beautiful future

1817
02:04:58,292 --> 02:05:01,208
<i>When something touches your heart</i>

1818
02:05:02,042 --> 02:05:05,625
<i>Say hi to it...</i>

1819
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:10,583
<i>When your heart is not in it</i>

1820
02:05:10,833 --> 02:05:14,583
<i>Say bye to it...</i>

1821
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:17,583
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1822
02:05:17,584 --> 02:05:19,792
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1823
02:05:19,793 --> 02:05:22,417
<i>Say hi to happiness</i>

1824
02:05:24,125 --> 02:05:26,208
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1825
02:05:26,375 --> 02:05:28,500
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1826
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:35,542
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1827
02:05:36,167 --> 02:05:39,208
<i>Love you life</i>

1828
02:05:40,542 --> 02:05:48,958
<i>Love you life</i>

1829
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:55,125
<i>Love me life</i>

1830
02:06:13,833 --> 02:06:17,125
Koko, I'm sorry

1831
02:06:19,333 --> 02:06:20,583
I'm sorry

1832
02:06:23,833 --> 02:06:24,333
Hello?

1833
02:06:24,334 --> 02:06:26,875
Hi Ma'am, I am calling from eBay,
are you happy with our services?

1834
02:06:26,876 --> 02:06:27,333
Yes why?

1835
02:06:27,958 --> 02:06:30,917
Please do continue shopping with us

1836
02:06:30,918 --> 02:06:31,792
Thank you

1837
02:06:47,583 --> 02:06:55,167
<i>Sometimes hold my hand,
and walk with me</i>

1838
02:06:55,708 --> 02:07:02,000
<i>Sometimes leave my hand,
and let me go free</i>

1839
02:07:04,833 --> 02:07:06,500
<i>I'm a little moody</i>

1840
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,917
<i>You're a little crazy</i>

1841
02:07:08,918 --> 02:07:13,208
<i>What a pair we are</i>

1842
02:07:13,209 --> 02:07:15,417
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1843
02:07:15,418 --> 02:07:17,583
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1844
02:07:17,584 --> 02:07:21,875
<i>Say hi to happiness...</i>

1845
02:07:21,876 --> 02:07:24,125
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1846
02:07:24,126 --> 02:07:26,250
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1847
02:07:26,251 --> 02:07:33,125
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1848
02:07:33,917 --> 02:07:43,458
<i>Love you life</i>

1849
02:07:47,083 --> 02:07:51,375
<i>Love me life</i>

1850
02:07:53,542 --> 02:07:56,792
You are different...

1851
02:07:58,417 --> 02:08:02,417
you listen to me, you really listen

1852
02:08:04,417 --> 02:08:07,708
I wish I had someone
like you in my life...

1853
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,583
Am I making sense?

1854
02:08:10,083 --> 02:08:13,458
Not at all,
but that will be 3000 rupees please

1855
02:09:01,875 --> 02:09:03,167
Where were you?

1856
02:09:03,667 --> 02:09:05,000
Just disappeared

1857
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:08,708
I have to give proper
notice if I miss a session...

1858
02:09:08,709 --> 02:09:12,417
and you left me with one small note

1859
02:09:12,418 --> 02:09:14,583
'Sorry'... that's not fair

1860
02:09:14,584 --> 02:09:17,500
I know, life is unfair

1861
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:19,583
Fine

1862
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:21,875
Hide all your secrets

1863
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:29,250
You know...

1864
02:09:29,251 --> 02:09:33,042
my issues with my
parents may get sorted...

1865
02:09:33,458 --> 02:09:37,042
but with men!

1866
02:09:37,417 --> 02:09:39,500
I am never going to find anyone

1867
02:09:46,667 --> 02:09:47,792
Tell me something

1868
02:09:49,833 --> 02:09:54,167
Is there such a thing
as a perfect relationship?

1869
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:58,375
Like just one special relationship?

1870
02:10:00,917 --> 02:10:02,750
Kaira I think...

1871
02:10:03,542 --> 02:10:08,083
why just that one
special relationship?

1872
02:10:08,917 --> 02:10:11,125
I think one can have
many relationships in life...

1873
02:10:11,126 --> 02:10:13,792
different relationships
for different experiences...

1874
02:10:13,793 --> 02:10:17,750
like a musical relationship...

1875
02:10:18,125 --> 02:10:22,583
someone who shares
our interest in music...

1876
02:10:23,208 --> 02:10:26,375
or the lets-get-coffee-together
relationship...

1877
02:10:26,792 --> 02:10:31,875
perfect to have coffee with...
but not anything else...

1878
02:10:33,042 --> 02:10:35,500
Special gossip relationship...

1879
02:10:35,501 --> 02:10:38,625
with whom you can
have the perfect gossip

1880
02:10:39,125 --> 02:10:42,083
Or the special
intellectual relationship...

1881
02:10:42,333 --> 02:10:45,917
for all those perfect
bookish discussions...

1882
02:10:47,083 --> 02:10:51,167
So many different,
special relationships...

1883
02:10:55,958 --> 02:11:00,875
The romantic relationship
is just one of many

1884
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:12,375
To expect a single relationship
to take on the burden of every need...

1885
02:11:13,375 --> 02:11:15,542
a bit unfair, right?

1886
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:23,917
Never thought of it this way

1887
02:11:33,625 --> 02:11:35,417
I'm glad the camera is back

1888
02:11:35,418 --> 02:11:36,750
Me too

1889
02:11:44,542 --> 02:11:49,917
Jug, do you want to get
a cup of coffee or something?

1890
02:11:50,625 --> 02:11:54,167
No, our time's up

1891
02:11:57,750 --> 02:12:00,000
You won't bunk the next session right?

1892
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:02,167
It is the last week of our sessions...

1893
02:12:02,792 --> 02:12:04,333
how can I miss that?

1894
02:12:35,167 --> 02:12:37,750
So, done sulking with Goa?

1895
02:12:38,292 --> 02:12:39,417
No more sulking

1896
02:12:41,375 --> 02:12:42,792
What about your work?

1897
02:12:42,958 --> 02:12:45,208
Actually I got an offer

1898
02:12:46,042 --> 02:12:46,792
What?

1899
02:12:47,708 --> 02:12:51,292
A production company is interested
in funding my short film...

1900
02:12:51,708 --> 02:12:56,625
so I am thinking,
why not stay back here and shoot it

1901
02:13:09,667 --> 02:13:13,333
Since it's the final class,
have I passed?

1902
02:13:14,208 --> 02:13:17,583
This isn't school, to pass or fail

1903
02:13:20,167 --> 02:13:23,250
I wish there were teachers
like you in school

1904
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:25,417
I'm no teacher

1905
02:13:25,875 --> 02:13:28,250
Okay not teacher but...

1906
02:13:29,083 --> 02:13:30,417
you know what I mean

1907
02:13:30,958 --> 02:13:34,875
We are all our own teachers
in the school of life

1908
02:13:35,417 --> 02:13:37,458
Okay, that got a bit heavy

1909
02:13:39,083 --> 02:13:44,000
Life is like a jigsaw puzzle

1910
02:13:44,583 --> 02:13:49,042
People like me can help
you find the missing pieces...

1911
02:13:49,292 --> 02:13:52,125
and put them back together...

1912
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:56,875
but, only you can complete the puzzle

1913
02:14:05,875 --> 02:14:11,125
So now that this is over...

1914
02:14:15,583 --> 02:14:20,250
can we meet outside of this...

1915
02:14:21,458 --> 02:14:24,125
just as friends or something?

1916
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:26,958
No this is not possible Kaira

1917
02:14:27,167 --> 02:14:30,167
And what if I tell you...

1918
02:14:30,792 --> 02:14:32,667
that I like you...

1919
02:14:36,792 --> 02:14:37,833
In fact...

1920
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:44,000
Go on, I'm listening

1921
02:14:47,042 --> 02:14:49,417
In fact I really like you

1922
02:14:52,625 --> 02:14:55,000
That's it, said it

1923
02:14:58,875 --> 02:15:00,875
I really like you too

1924
02:15:02,125 --> 02:15:03,917
I really like you

1925
02:15:04,917 --> 02:15:07,083
I respect your feelings...

1926
02:15:07,708 --> 02:15:10,875
but my job here is done for now

1927
02:15:11,542 --> 02:15:17,792
As unconventional and friendly
as my methods may be...

1928
02:15:18,167 --> 02:15:21,958
lam still your therapist...

1929
02:15:23,208 --> 02:15:29,417
any other 'friendship' would be outside
the realm of my own professional ethics

1930
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:40,083
The closeness that you may feel to me,
your 'BD'...

1931
02:15:40,084 --> 02:15:42,625
is very normal

1932
02:15:45,167 --> 02:15:49,708
This happens, it's common

1933
02:15:49,958 --> 02:15:50,958
So I'm common?

1934
02:15:50,959 --> 02:15:54,833
No, you are not common

1935
02:15:55,042 --> 02:15:57,500
You are different, special...

1936
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:59,375
you are unique

1937
02:16:01,333 --> 02:16:02,208
You know Kaira

1938
02:16:02,209 --> 02:16:09,042
People feel all sorts
of strong emotions in here...

1939
02:16:09,375 --> 02:16:12,792
anger, hate, love

1940
02:16:13,792 --> 02:16:16,625
I shouldn't have said anything

1941
02:16:16,626 --> 02:16:18,458
No, you should have

1942
02:16:18,708 --> 02:16:22,708
It's really good
you said what you said

1943
02:16:23,583 --> 02:16:28,333
You expressed your
difficult feelings...

1944
02:16:28,334 --> 02:16:32,667
in a straightforward
and mature manner...

1945
02:16:33,125 --> 02:16:36,708
rather than letting them fester...

1946
02:16:36,958 --> 02:16:39,833
inside of you...

1947
02:16:40,667 --> 02:16:42,167
and we don't want that...

1948
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:42,792
No

1949
02:16:46,667 --> 02:16:50,792
This Kaira, is huge progress

1950
02:17:05,208 --> 02:17:08,458
Okay but, tell me one thing

1951
02:17:08,833 --> 02:17:10,667
How can this be the last session?

1952
02:17:10,668 --> 02:17:13,042
No no...

1953
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,083
No more stories?

1954
02:17:16,708 --> 02:17:19,958
So many new problems I will have...

1955
02:17:20,833 --> 02:17:25,917
Yes there will be many problems...

1956
02:17:26,583 --> 02:17:32,958
but now you know how to solve them

1957
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,292
But I'll need help

1958
02:17:40,875 --> 02:17:42,542
I need you

1959
02:17:50,333 --> 02:17:51,375
Kaira...

1960
02:17:52,208 --> 02:17:54,500
when you see a pattern
emerging in life...

1961
02:17:55,042 --> 02:18:00,542
a habit,
then it's time to think about it

1962
02:18:01,083 --> 02:18:04,333
Genius is about knowing when to stop

1963
02:19:11,167 --> 02:19:12,333
Okay then

1964
02:21:14,667 --> 02:21:19,583
Baby Fatima, can't believe it

1965
02:21:22,375 --> 02:21:27,750
<i>This is your godmother, Kokomaa</i>

1966
02:21:36,083 --> 02:21:38,958
Battle after battle

1967
02:21:39,583 --> 02:21:44,375
Corporal Balthazar fought
in the Portuguese army for 14 years

1968
02:21:46,042 --> 02:21:50,458
Nobody knew that Corporal
Balthazar was not Balthazar...

1969
02:21:50,459 --> 02:21:53,375
but Dona Maria, a woman...

1970
02:21:53,875 --> 02:21:56,708
disguised as a man

1971
02:21:57,083 --> 02:22:03,000
This was the only way for a woman
to safeguard her life and dignity

1972
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:06,792
For 14 years Dona Maria
fought two battles...

1973
02:22:06,793 --> 02:22:10,500
one on the battlefield,
and the other with herself...

1974
02:22:10,792 --> 02:22:13,750
with her fears

1975
02:22:13,751 --> 02:22:17,042
Finally, one clay on the battlefield,
her true identity was revealed

1976
02:22:17,458 --> 02:22:18,458
As fate would have it...

1977
02:22:18,667 --> 02:22:21,333
in front of Captain Aphonso...

1978
02:22:27,458 --> 02:22:28,792
Captain Aphonso...

1979
02:22:29,042 --> 02:22:31,583
Commander of the fort and a doctor...

1980
02:22:31,833 --> 02:22:33,417
not only saved Dona Maria's life...

1981
02:22:33,418 --> 02:22:34,625
and nursed her wounds...

1982
02:22:34,833 --> 02:22:37,333
but made her fears disappear...

1983
02:22:38,167 --> 02:22:42,083
and freed her from the
ghost of Corporal Balthazar

1984
02:22:44,417 --> 02:22:46,250
For the first time...

1985
02:22:46,251 --> 02:22:49,167
Dona Maria had the courage
to face her true self

1986
02:22:49,875 --> 02:22:54,250
Finally she felt free, she felt alive

1987
02:22:56,750 --> 02:23:03,583
With her newfound courage,
Dona Maria soon became Commander...

1988
02:23:03,875 --> 02:23:07,375
the first woman Commander
of the Portuguese army...

1989
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:11,917
Now, Donna Maria fought
only one battle...

1990
02:23:12,583 --> 02:23:15,875
the one on the battlefield

1991
02:24:09,292 --> 02:24:10,958
Speech! Speech!

1992
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:13,792
No speech, just shut up!

1993
02:24:15,042 --> 02:24:17,333
It was beautiful my darling

1994
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:21,208
So proud of you

1995
02:24:25,833 --> 02:24:27,000
Beautiful film

1996
02:24:27,375 --> 02:24:27,708
Really?

1997
02:24:27,875 --> 02:24:28,667
Very impressed

1998
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:33,292
People who make music with
the camera don't need musicians

1999
02:24:36,417 --> 02:24:38,750
I wrote a song for you,
want to listen?

2000
02:24:39,542 --> 02:24:40,833
Just kidding

2001
02:24:42,625 --> 02:24:43,667
I'm proud of you

2002
02:24:44,417 --> 02:24:46,875
You gave Kaira her first break right?

2003
02:24:46,876 --> 02:24:47,750
Yes

2004
02:24:47,917 --> 02:24:50,167
She could not have
done this without you

2005
02:24:50,168 --> 02:24:54,792
Actually if I was with her,
she couldn't have done this

2006
02:24:55,833 --> 02:24:57,333
Cheers!

2007
02:24:58,167 --> 02:25:00,833
To the longest project
of this century!

2008
02:25:02,167 --> 02:25:03,417
Cheers to my baby

2009
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:09,667
Hi!

2010
02:25:09,668 --> 02:25:10,583
Hi!

2011
02:25:11,958 --> 02:25:13,000
I was wondering...

2012
02:25:13,208 --> 02:25:16,167
Yes please tell me,
what were you wondering?

2013
02:25:16,458 --> 02:25:18,542
Would you be able to
live as a man for a few years?

2014
02:25:18,917 --> 02:25:19,792
Huh?

2015
02:25:21,792 --> 02:25:23,792
It's a really interesting concept,
your story

2016
02:25:25,792 --> 02:25:27,000
How did you come up with the idea?

2017
02:25:29,125 --> 02:25:29,792
What's your story?

2018
02:25:31,125 --> 02:25:33,958
Do you make films too?

2019
02:25:33,959 --> 02:25:35,583
No, I make furniture...

2020
02:25:36,167 --> 02:25:38,833
tables, sofas, chairs

2021
02:25:39,583 --> 02:25:40,667
Chairs?

2022
02:25:42,208 --> 02:25:44,292
<i>Like Kursi chairs?</i>

2023
02:25:44,875 --> 02:25:46,625
<i>Chairs like Kursi</i>

2024
02:25:47,083 --> 02:25:49,042
<i>Kursi like chairs</i>

2025
02:26:26,792 --> 02:26:27,958
Dear life,

2026
02:26:28,958 --> 02:26:31,750
I know we haven't been
in touch for a while...

2027
02:26:32,875 --> 02:26:34,000
So nothing

2028
02:26:34,917 --> 02:26:36,042
Just wanted to say hi

2029
02:26:49,708 --> 02:26:54,000
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi...</i>
