1
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,375
You were saying that this time it will be done.

2
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,291
 This is a good business you have made.

3
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,750
Since last two years I am taking treatment from you.

4
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,041
 Bhatia sir I understand your feelings.

5
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
But didn't you only select the donor after checking...

6
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,875
 ...the photo and other details.

7
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,333
 I am just a doctor and not God.

8
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:05,666
We tried, but it didn't work, what do I do?

9
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,416
Doctor it's been 8 years since she's been keeping all fasts...

10
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,958
 and hasn't left out any temple...

11
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,083
...mosque or any saint and now your telling us "what to do".

12
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,583
I will get it printed in the Times that you are cheating the people.

13
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,791
Bhatia sir you cool down... have water. Don't take stress.

14
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,875
If not today then tomorrow, she will definitely conceive.

15
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,416
 What is Dr. Chaddha sitting here for?

16
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,791
 Now look at this and understand.

17
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,583
 This is the female organ...

18
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,791
See this is uterus here somewhere here is the egg.

19
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:37,125
 The sperm and the egg must meet.

20
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,958
Here the sperm travels, travels and meets here...

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,500
...hits here and then baby is conceived.

22
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,166
Some sperms penetrate, some bounce back.

23
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,208
In your case this meeting is not happening

24
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,583
 Then make it meet.

25
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,458
If we don't have a child, my brother will takeaway my business.

26
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,666
 He is a big idiot.

27
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,916
 Lets take god's name and try once more

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,125
Well fine, as it is it's been 2 years, might as well try once again.

29
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,333
But this time we need a good quality sperm. - Definitely.

30
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,916
 But this is the final try.

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,083
Come on... he said he'll give us a good sperm

32
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,541
 Come on...

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,041
Sir be prepared to put these locks permanently.

34
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,500
The samples we have are good for nothing.

35
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,583
Had even printed 3 ads in the newspaper...

36
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,833
...but not a single reply worth considering.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,458
 Wretched sperm.

38
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,291
 Chaman pick up the phone.

39
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,375
 Dr. Chaddha's clinic.

40
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,125
 I need to talk to Dr. Chaddha

41
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,458
 He is in an emergency case.

42
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,000
And will call back, the moment he is free.

43
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,166
 I wont spare that bas$%

44
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,416
Tell that Dr. Chaddha of yours, not to lie to me.

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,791
 He has taken 30% advance from me...

46
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,125
Even after promising, he hasn't given us a quality sperm.

47
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,916
You tell that guy I'll hunt him down. You see what I will do to him.

48
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,458
 Now, why you are staring at me.

49
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,083
 As if I have used the sample.

50
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,375
Chaddha sir get me the sample of a cricketer.

51
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,291
Not only will he play for the country but also mint money.

52
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:10,666
And if we have a sweet girl then she can become a model

53
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,708
 Don't you worry about the money.

54
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,958
 We will load you with cash.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,333
 We will take very good care sir.

56
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,083
 I get it.

57
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,416
You want a Dhoni. - Yes.

58
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,666
And you want an Aishwarya. - Yes.

59
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,125
Yes, sir. Then there's no worry what the child will be when..

60
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,416
..he grows up. - Absolutely.

61
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,291
First decide his career and then give birth to the child.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,250
 I will call you. Ok sir.

63
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,541
Thank you. - Thank you.

64
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,750
 God bless.

65
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,625
 "We play with life all the time."

66
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,625
 "Lets play together."

67
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,541
 "There is no tension in life."

68
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,458
"Ask each other, 'how is your mother'?"

69
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,500
 "We play with life all the time."

70
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,375
 "Lets play together."

71
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,416
 Aunty take 300 rupees.

72
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,625
 What's the matter Dolly aunty?

73
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,375
This shade of lipstick is looking very nice... its suiting you I say.

74
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,541
When it comes to good looks... all we can do is take care...

75
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,250
...though the truth is that with age we will lose it... - Yes.

76
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,541
Anyways your mom's henna is due send her.

77
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,750
I'll let her know. - Just clean it quickly.

78
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,250
By the way did Vicky find a job or is he still as useless?

79
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,041
He will find one, you needn't worry. - Okay.

80
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,833
And listen didn't your engagement break sometime back?

81
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,458
Aren't your folks looking for another guy?

82
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,875
 I will tell you later on. Okay...

83
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,041
 Loud mouth.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,833
Oh god its already ten and Vicky is still sleeping

85
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,875
 My knees pain...

86
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,291
 I feel like a maid in my own house...

87
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,541
 ..take care of parlor... grand mom.

88
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,291
 Oh Vicky

89
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,000
 Vicky why don't you wake up.

90
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,541
How long are you going to sleep now? Get up Vicky.

91
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,875
 Wonder why She doesn't let him sleep

92
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,958
 A theft has taken place.

93
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,708
 Where has the T. V gone.

94
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,541
Vicky - What happened? - Vicky they have taken the our T. V...

95
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,541
 All the clothes also taken.

96
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,333
were you sleeping like Kumbhkaran (sleeping giant)...

97
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,041
...or did you eat an entire pack of sleeping pills?

98
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,541
Every morning you get possessed by some ghost or what? - Grand mom.

99
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,583
we have been destroyed. B$%^*^$ have taken away everything

100
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,791
Why are you abusing? There is nothing that you can do

101
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,583
Shut up and what you are seeing from there like monkey.

102
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,708
Let me see atleast, what are you doing?

103
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,000
 We have been ruined grand mom.

104
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,375
...good that they stole the TV coz if you had...

105
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,541
 ...to sell it to a trash picker...

106
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,875
...you wouldn't have got more than one thousand. - Look at what she says.

107
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,500
Your all the old sarees could've been used for this only

108
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,666
 What are you smelling like a dog?

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,583
Looks like it was the black underwear gang... just smell and see.

110
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:27,375
Go and lodge an FIR and find out from the shop in Ambar Colony.

111
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,916
 They might have sold the T.V. there.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,291
Listen that Mr. Bhale is giving 1500 per month to the watchman...

113
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,875
...and whole night he whistles outside his house.

114
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,083
 Why don't you increase his fees?

115
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,375
Don't you dare talk about the money to me. Increase his fees.

116
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,916
God knows how many kilos of detergent goes in washing your jeans...

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,500
...and then who pays for your shopping and...

118
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,250
 ...club expenses with your friends?

119
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,875
All I know is that if you want to stay in this house...

120
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,166
...pay 5000 rupees every month... and that's final.

121
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,708
Let me get the job once then I will return all your money.

122
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,208
For God sake now don't start the story of doing a job.

123
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,291
 See the entire history so far...

124
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,750
no one has ever done job in the family of Arora.

125
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,958
 Here... take this

126
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,666
 Umm... I will not keep quiet.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,541
Why don't you take care of the business along with your uncle?

128
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,958
You'll have to speak English in the job.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,375
 You will have to wear a suit.

130
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,875
I am not going to give you a penny more

131
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,291
 You are my mummy or my enemy.

132
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,166
Now where you are going with the whisky. Won't you have tea?

133
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,375
 Get me phenyl instead

134
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,375
 Phenyl? I don't know anything.

135
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,125
Now you come to house after earning money

136
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,791
Vicky stop. - Get lost.

137
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,166
 Now suffer because of the pampering...

138
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Obviously there is no trend of 'good' morning in your father's house.

139
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,875
A robbery was to happen, it happened...

140
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,166
 You are screaming unnecessarily.

141
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,041
The whole life has gone by but I've never purchased...

142
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,458
 ...anything for my own self.

143
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,583
My small parlor income can't take care of your expensive desires.

144
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,666
 Wants to buy a flat TV...

145
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,500
Look at her.. - What to do your destiny is only not good...

146
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,458
listen, get me one more cup of tea. It's too cold.

147
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,125
And as for TV, that I will buy anyways... that too Sony.

148
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,125
 42 inches.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,333
 What did you think that I am dog?

150
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,166
 You'll sleep and I'll guard you.

151
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,166
 I kept you for barking.

152
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,666
 Lazy bum.

153
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,875
 Listen. What is this?

154
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,625
 Sir ji you do your work.

155
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,208
 What are you doing? This is my car.

156
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,000
Your car. - Then what. This is my car. - Okay.

157
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,208
 You keep you car. This is my dog.

158
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,708
 You go with your dog.

159
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,791
This is my dog and I am tying. What is your problem?

160
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,000
If it is yours then take it some where else. - Why?

161
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,375
 Munjal sir what happened?

162
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,541
Nareshji no one is understanding the matter.

163
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,625
I was coming from the market in the morning and...

164
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,125
...from market I went in the park. I did exercise in the park.

165
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,500
What are you doing this. You are just confusing us.

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,041
 Munjal sir just clear the matter.

167
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,708
 You are not understanding.

168
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,458
I am telling that I went in the market and did exercise in the park.

169
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,791
When I came here then seen that this boy

170
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,875
...was tying his dog in front of my car. - Tell me one thing.

171
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,291
Why you are taking so much time in explaining. I'll tell you.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,083
this is your house. - Ground floor is mine.

173
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,125
Ground floor is yours and car is also yours. - This is my car.

174
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,333
 Is it your dog?

175
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,916
 This is not my dog.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,291
You understand this. - The same thing I am telling.

177
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,708
This is not my dog. You understand this.

178
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,875
 This is a Labrador.

179
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,750
 See carefully it is Doberman.

180
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,625
 My experience says it is Labrador.

181
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,791
 What is this nuisance in the morning?

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,500
Is anyone dancing here? Now get lost from here.

183
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,333
You listen to me. - He has gone crazy.

184
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,375
 Daddy see. What a cute dog?

185
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,708
Listen... I was... - Excuse me.

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,708
Isn't he cute? - You like it? - Yes, very much. - What the price?

187
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,666
Sold the dog. By God he is a heartless sperm.

188
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,458
 Are you happy now? Come on, let's go.

189
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,000
Some donor have come for interview. Shall I send them?

00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,958

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,333
 You won't be able to do it...

194
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,583
 You just give chance and see.

195
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,916

 What sir.

202
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,208
How much cash do you think I will make out of this.

203
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,666
 I stay in Noida... can do updown.

204
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,875
 I can sing

205
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,083
 I won't get money?

206
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,708

Henceforth filter and then send. - Yes sir.

212

From tomorrow onwards you start coming on my shop at Rajori.

213
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,083
You will learn the work in 5 - 6 months and...

214
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,208
...hen start your own work in South Delhi. - That's right.

215
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,875
Yes How long will you be wandering aimlessly here and there.

216
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,125
 What's the problem?

217
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,875
 You are the biggest problem.

218
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,416
All you do is sell clothes and you will make Vicky also do the same.

219
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,208
What grand mom you are also always cursing him.

220
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,458
What is wrong in his work? - Again you started. - Keep quiet.

221
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,375
Uncle I won't sell your polka dot clothes. I want to do a job.

222
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,125
 There is respect in that.

223
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,500
And respect is what sets apart business class from officer class.

224
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,166
I won't lift your shop shutter up and down...

225
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,125
Vicky this is no way to talk to elders.

226
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,666
 Mummy I want respect. I want class.

227
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,500
 Oh ya as if I have no respect...

228
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,583

On top of that you have pampered him so much.

239
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,000
If you deserve then I will give respect to you.

240
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,000
grand mom when you give only then I'll deserve.

241
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,166

Status on Face book is 'complicated' but on Orkut it shows 'single'.

269
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,333
 And the watchman was saying that...

270

00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,708
 At what age?

282
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,541

283
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,458

287
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,541
 Uhh you are drinking slowly.

288
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,333
 But even I am not high yet.

289
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,000
 Umm. Dolly I'll tell you something...

290
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,916
 I respect you a lot.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,750
grand mom let it be. By morning you will forget all this respect...

292
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,666
...and be back to cursing me and my destiny.

293
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:11,000
Don't feel bad as I speak anything in the hangover.

294
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:17,041
But I didn't get a single penny in your dowry...

295
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,666
 ...this hurts me till date...

296
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,666
 ...that's why I speak like that...

297
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,791
 ...grand mom this is wrong.

298
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,333
 You know I have given my whole life...

299
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,000
...and my beauty parlour income to you.

300
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:36,833
I never served my own mother as much as I have served you.

301
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,541
 And you speak like this...

302
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,083
 I know it.

303
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:46,291
 and only you can take my tantrums...

304
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,708
 ...that's why I respect you...

305
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,250
but only if you had got something for me from...

306
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,000
 ...your home when you got married...

307
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,416
 it would have been nice...

308
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,875
when Vicky's wife will get nothing for you...

309
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,500
 then you'll know how much it hurts

310
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:08,708
Uhh grand mom I told you several times...

311
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:13,041
...not to take the Vicky's name while drinking...

312
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,541
 ...I loose the high.

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,875
I don't know what he will do in his life.

314
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:25,083
He is a good boy and one day he will make our ARORA family famous.

315
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,166
 Let it be. Prepare one more.

00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,333
 Sir one round takes 15 minutes.

320
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,000
I am the watchman and not the superman.

321
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,208
 Really?

322
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,916

 Just I asked this casually.

334
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,291

I had a small infertility clinic in Dariaganj...

352
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,958
...for the treatment of the married couple who don't have any issue.

353
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,291
 Side by side I am running a bank also.

354
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:51,458
For that I need a special donor. Sperm donor.

355
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,916
 What happen.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,125
 What so funny?

357
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,041
 Sir this is the thing for donation.

358
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,791
 What so funny about it?

359
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,083
 Stop.

360
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,333
 Why are you laughing?

361
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,291
Thank you sir for dropping me home in the cold.

362
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,291
 What's so funny about it?

363
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,833
 Think about it... I will pay you well.

364
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,750
 Let it be thank you.

365
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,541
 "A white hen on the roof."

366
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:31,583
 "A white hen on the roof."

367
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:36,625
 "Hey female with a veil.."

368
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,916
"..the boy is crazy after you." - Crazy boy.

369
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,375
If he wasn't my neighbor, I would have hit him with my sandal...

370
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:46,166
You beat him and see. I will cut your water pipeline.

371
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,166
Then we'll see how you wash your henna.

372
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,666
 ...Indian Idol wannabe...

373
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,625
No grand mom you don't be angry. I was just joking.

374
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,750
 Here Vicky have this...

375
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,291

376
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,125
 Hello Dolly Beauty Parlour.

377
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,875

382
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,166
No thank you sir. Now next time don't try to call me again.

383
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,666
 It will not be good for you.

384
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,541
 Wrong number.

385
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,250
Nowadays too wrong number phones are coming for you.

386
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,500
Vicky listen. - Yes what?

387
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,958
This is parlour's money, go and deposit it in the cooperative bank.

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,375
And get the passbook updated. - No mummy

389
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,166
No ya mom your bank is dated it has no reputation not even an ATM.

390
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,791
Don't fuss around... we've had an account in the bank since partition.

391
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,791
I am going... but to open a new account.

392
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,666
Vicky please don't create a new problem.

393
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,291
 Sure. Sure.

394
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,541
Yeah, just give me like one hour. Okay?

395
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,041
Excuse me. - Ma'am I want to open an account.

396
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,875
 And here is the money.

397
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,875
Have you come for the first time in the bank?

398
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,041
Yes. - Ok.

399
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,750
Well, sir that's not how the accounts are opened.

400
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,125
Fill up the form and take a token from that counter.

401
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,083
You can come back as your number comes.

402
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,666
But Ma'am there is no one in the queue.

403
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,000
 Sir these are bank rules. Please.

404
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,791
 Weird rules I say.

405
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,125
 Sir your money.

406
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,416
 Oh! Thank you. Thank you so much.

407
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,500
 Ashima lunch

408
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,708
 Come on, let's go.

409
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,500
 Ma'am you are going half day.

410
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,916
I got the token also and we will fill up the form also.

411
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,333
 Its lunch hour sir.

412
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,500
 I have to go.

413
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,083
 Till then you sign on the bottom.

414
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,541
3 passport photos, all these documents and some one to introduce you.

415
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,708
 Why others. I can introduce myself...

416
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:52,041
Myself Vicky Arora and you are Ashima Roy.

417
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,916
 Oh you are a Bengali?

418
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,958
 Yes I am not Punjabi.

419
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,791
You bring some one else who has an account in this bank...

420
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,458
 ...and can introduce you.

421
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,916
 Okay.

422
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,083
 Shall we?

423
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,208
Ashima, he is Varun's friend. - What?

424
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,958
Sir. - Now what?

425
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,083
 Fifth?

426
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,125
To hell with you. The clinic is suffering losses ..

427
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,375
..and you are producing one after another..

428
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,791
I have already offered you but you always say no.

429
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,750
Shut up. There is something called the family back ground of sperm.

430
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,041
 Duffer sperm!

431
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,750
 Cancel all my appointments.

432
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,750
Madam how is it fault if I have had a fifth child?

433
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,750
 Here, you have...

434
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,166
I thought you'd be a decent guy since you're a doctor.

435
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,041
 By God you really have a dirty mind.

436
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,625
 Very awkward. What is dirty in that?

437
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,416
You are asking youngsters to do such type of cheap work...

438
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,208
Do you even know what you are talking about?

439
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,375
I have good respect and my patients worship me

440
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,708
 Do you know that?

441
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,958
 It makes no difference to me.

442
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,750
Keep your respect at home... doesn't matter to me...

443
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,416
 I hate kids

444
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,666
 But why?

445
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,333
Have you ever smelled them? There is so much foul smell.

446
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:07,208
Of urine... of potty... and when they vomit doing wuack...

447
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,833
 I don't want to have kids...

448
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,041
Who is telling you to give birth to a child?

449
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,750
When it is my sperm then won't the child be mine?

450
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,958
 Only your sperm will be used.

451
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,000
Talk softly... the shop owner knows me...

452
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,500
You will have me killed. - Sorry, sorry.

453
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,166
Ya ya I've got it all packed... now please keep the phone...

454
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:27,250
Now what I was saying was that... only the sperm will be yours

455
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:31,541
...but the responsibility of the children will not be yours...

456
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,125
 Neither the susu nor the potty...

457
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,166
 In any case it is going waste.

458
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,291
Become a donor, at least some one will be benefited.

459
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,583
No how do you know that it is going waste.

460
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,708
 And as it is it gets wasted only...

461
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,458
Shall I store it in a syntax tank overhead or what

462
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:50,833
Don't store in the tank but store with me.

463
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,500
 I will give you money also for that.

464
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,583
Sir why are you getting me trapped into...

465
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,000
 I am trapping you?

466
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,125
The real trapping is what the people in cities face these days.

467
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,791
This infertility is the cancer of modern life.

468
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,708
 I don't want to listen.

469
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:11,541
My dear this is the problem of insecure and highly ambitious people.

470
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,083
 See the routine life.

471
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:17,166
Sitting late in the office then fighting the traffic return home...

472
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,708
...taking drink and again working on the laptop.

473
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,833
And finally telling your wife that darling I am too tired.

474
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,375
 There married life becomes hell...

475
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,166
One's left unable to do the real work...

476
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,833
 On the other hand are our villagers...

477
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,791
their touch is enough to make a woman conceive

478
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,916
Do you know the root cause of this problem... ask me what

479
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,375
what... - Stress

480
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,708
What? Stress. - Stress.

481
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:44,458
The sperm count becomes low as the stress goes higher.

482
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,500
You and the village... same to same... copy... ditto

483
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:51,625
lucky... happy... and stress free... highly fertile...

484
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,083
 ...help me please

485
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,583
 you've come back to your purpose...

486
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,875
I don't want to do this social service.

487
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,416
 Okay, I agree to you.

488
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,958
But what is the guarantee that there will be child.

489
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,208
 No there is no guarantee...

490
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,958
 No guarantee.

491
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,708
 But this will be known...

492
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,500
...whether you are capable to give birth to a child or not.

493
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,041
Stop the car. - Yes.

494
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,291
I said stop the car. - One minute what happened?

495
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,333
 Stop the car.

496
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,125
 What happened?

497
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,125
 Hello!

498
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,666
How could you say it... that I am not fit for that...

499
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:35,958
 I cannot give birth to a child?

500
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,291
 Don't misunderstand me.

501
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,291
 Misunderstanding... my foot...

502
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,000
Now dare you call me ever again... - Listen to me.

503
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,000
Who are you to talk such crap about me?

504
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,250
 Don't misunderstand me.

505
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,500
 Sorry dear

506
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:59,333
I'm telling you... I can give birth to as many kids...

507
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:05,208
 That is exactly why I came to you.

508
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,458
 Heights of being a pile on ya...

509
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,500
 Now what are you doing here?

510
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:27,583
Drinking affects the strength of the sperm...

511
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,000
 Uhhhhh...

512
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,583
 I haven't said yes to you as yet...

513
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:32,916
 But you haven't said no either...

514
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,166
 Understand my problem.

515
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,750
 Will you have cold coffee?

516
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,250
 Can I drop you somewhere?

517
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,750
 See Vicky I am not pressurizing you.

518
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,416
 but please understand my situation...

519
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,333
 Can we talk in the evening. Ok.

520
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,791
 Shall I wait.

521
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,000
 What time, what time in the evening?

522
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,041
 There is one link.

523
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,583
My cousin's brother in law works with the RBI.

524
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,750
 Sorry sir, not possible.

525
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,750
I think I'll now have to find a source in the ministry

526
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,375
 Not even then sir

527
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,416
 There must be some way out.

528
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't know anyone who has an account with your bank

529
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,375
...does that mean I can't get my account opened?

530
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,833
Sir I have already told you I do not have the authority.

531
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,875
 You could speak to the Branch Manager.

532
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,833
 I spoke to him but..

533
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:43,083
By the way Ashima, your account is with this bank right?

534
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,458
Obviously - So..

535
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,708
 Lets, you and me become friends...

536
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,875
...and you give me a NOC... my works done...

537
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,750
 Sir I don't know you.

538
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,083
 Care for some coffee

539
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:06,166
 I'll get some connection... see you...

540
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,583
Dr. Chaddha I really gave it a serious thought

541
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:18,041
I am unemployed, sort of good for nothing...

542
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,833
that doesn't mean I'd do such kind of silly work...

543
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,208
 So my final decision is a NO!

544
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,291
 Do you believe in God.

545
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,041
 Almost

546
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,208
 Then, for god's sake say yes

547
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:37,000
See if I don't get a donor like you, my clinic will get ruined...

548
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,916
 the competition is very tough...

549
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,625
...everything will get ruined. - Listen don't do this emotional talk.

550
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,458
Please go ahead and catch some other party.

551
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,708
 Thank you.

552
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,541
 What are you saying?

553
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,416
Here... things are getting ruined and you're saying...

554
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,041
 ...I should speak to someone else...

555
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,000
It won't be that easy to get someone else

556
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,416
So what do I care... sit on the seat...

557
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,458
Is there only one guy in the whole of Delhi.

558
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:03,208
...neither does he belong to the Tatas or Birlas...

559
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,500
You're just wasting your time behind him... for no reason...

560
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,708
 There is...

561
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,208
 There is... something in the boy

562
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:17,125
This one is of our south trip. That time Vicky was 8 years old.

563
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,916
 And this one... is when I was young

564
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 You don't look old now either.

565
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,875
 Thank you.

566
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,291
Well... - By the way I'm not that old...

567
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,666
...but when faced with increasing responsibilities at a young age...

568
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,041
...the stress does come out on the body and face. - Yes yes.

569
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,125
 And this one is my husband's.

570
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,958
He died after this trip. This is his last photo.

571
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,875
 Doesn't he look a lot like Obama.

572
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,500
Yes yes... same to same... just 2 shades fairer...

573
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:45,291
Whenever that chap comes on TV, I leave all my work and sit...

574
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,541
It feels as if he has taken a rebirth in America.

575
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,375
 Oh Vicky you've come.

576
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,041
You didn't tell me that you are starting a business with Chaddha sir.

577
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:57,375
 You got quite late.

578
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,791
 You were quite a naughty boy...

579
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,875
...have come to know of your entire history...

580
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,958
But I didn't reveal that thing, promise...

581
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:09,875
Oh no man, by god, mom's swear, you have crossed the limit

582
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,666
 Relax, mummy will hear it

583
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,416
Mummy.. - Please, don't touch me.

584
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,416
Do you know what a big pile on you are?

585
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,666
See if you don't want to do it, then don't.

586
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:28,625
 But don't call me a pile on.

587
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,041
 It hurts.

588
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,208
 You only tell me...

589
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,333
 Sir I am a common man.

590
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,083
I live in Lajpat Nagar's refugee colony...

591
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,458
 My mother is a widow.

592
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,791
If she, Pepsi aunty, Sharma's, Bhalla's, Chopra's...

593
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,750
if they come to know that I do such... meaning such kind of work...

594
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,333
 ...then I'll lose all my respect...

595
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,583
you'll get me thrown out of the colony.

596
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:54,125
See what I am trying to say is that I am a certified MBBS doctor...

597
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,958
 ...and this work is legal.

598
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Not from today but since the times of the Mahabharata.

599
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,333
I can stand at India Gate and announce that...

600
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,875
 ...its an ancient science...

601
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:09,833
when women couldn't have children, they used to call Rishis...

602
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:13,583
Rishis used to give their blessings... 'tatha asthu'...

603
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:19,000
...and there done... it's a very ancient science what's wrong in it

604
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,291
And if you look at it from a business point of view...

605
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,041
...then you can make money, I can make money...

606
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,875
...my clinic will get saved... rest is upto you...

607
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,583
 Should I leave?

608
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,041
Good night. - Good night.

609
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,375
 Yes.

610
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:53,208
Yes, Dr. Chaddha had come in the morning, he's very jocular by nature

611
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,666
 Whiskey has come back...

612
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,375
..don't know from where Dr. Chaddha got him from

613
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,708
 Okay, mom.

614
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,416
 The baby has to be matching with us.

615
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,875
 We are very classy people...

616
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,208
...we want our baby to be like us... refined... you know.

617
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,125
 Absolutely aristocratic...

618
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:18,541
Not a problem. Just fill up your requirements in the form.

619
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:22,333
Next week John Abraham is coming to Delhi.

620
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,916
If he agrees, then we'll make a deal with him.

621
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,250
 Don't joke, Baldev.

622
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,166
 Madam you are the one joking.

623
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,500
See it is my guarantee to give you a healthy sperm...

624
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,750
 ...with a good hit rate.

625
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:37,500
But whether the baby will be well behaved or naughty how I can tell?

626
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,333
You have a nice day. - Thank you very much, Dr. Baldev.

627
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,583
Next - Sir!

628
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,541
Don't you think it is a little bit funny?

629
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,125
 Yeah, that's okay. Its alright.

630
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,041
 Listen to me clearly.

631
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,416
 Tell me.

632
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,833
 I am doing this only for pocket money.

633
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:05,000
 There has been no change of heart

634
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,375
Okay. - I still hate children.

635
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,041
 Got it.

636
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,375
 Got it.

637
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:11,791
 Go there.

638
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,375
Latha. - Yes sir...

639
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,791
 Take his details.

640
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,041
 Okay sir.

641
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,041
Name? - Vicky Arora.

642
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,416
Sex? - Male.

643
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,291
Age? - 25.

644
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,583
Height? - 5'10

645
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,250
Come. - You're coming with me?

646
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,291
 Yes, sir. Come sir

647
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,541
There is the wash basin, and here is the tissue paper...

648
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,208
 ...and here is the container.

649
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,291
In this, you may throw it and store it...

650
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,000
 Okay sir.

651
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,000
 Done sir.

652
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,500
What happened? - Wouldn't happen like this...

653
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,875
 No problem.

654
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,041
This is called performance pressure in medical terms.

655
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,291
Everyone goes through it... even cricketers before a game...

656
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,166
 Don't get tensed. Come with me.

657
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,166
 Come come... inside here...

658
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,458
Lata! - Yes sir.

659
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,875
 Thank you.

660
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,666
sit... sit. Don't take stress. We have a solution for everything.

661
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,416
 Here, take this this Oh Boi...

662
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,958
 Double X boys... Excite boys...

663
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,750
 This is DVD. Double X.

664
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,791
Triple X... and this is wild ones... right...

665
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,416
 Ok. All the best.

666
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,083
Play the DVD and put on the headphones... all the best

667
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,583
 Done?

668
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,333
 Done sir.

669
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,750
 Congratulations. Your first payment.

670
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,041
Balance will be paid to you after completing the procedure.

671
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,333
 Balance payment.

672
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:24,541
What I mean is that for the next five to six months...

673
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,250
...this sample will be tested in the lab...

674
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,416
...and if there is a meeting with the egg..

675
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,333
 ..then we shall pay you the balance.

676
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,000
 As it is we have a done deal right

677
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:36,208
You just enjoy! - "The spark plug is jammed"

678
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,375
 My destiny is doomed

679
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,458
 My destiny is doomed

680
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:47,000
Sharma's, Rowde's, Bhalla's, all victims

681
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,000
 Part of the guilty army

682
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,458
 Part of the guilty army

683
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,333
 No more prayers, no more medicines

684
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:55,375
 I am changing my style

685
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,583
 Let all men take a hike

686
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,333
 I have found the potent Chaddha

687
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,958
 Chasing...

688
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,041
 Chasing...

689
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,750
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

690
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,000
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

691
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,083
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

692
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,833
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

693
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,041
 Vicky you... now what...

694
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,666
You had told me that you will meet me when I get myself a job.

695
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,250
 So I came here first

696
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,583
Really? - Yeah?

697
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,500
 Oh you are working now

698
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,625
Marketing? - Yuck...

699
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,375
 I am a sperm donor

700
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,500
Only sick people like you can do this kind of work.

701
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,000
Next time don't show me your face... Get lost.

702
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,666
 He's modern's world's handyman

703
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,708
 Going all around with his sticky hands

704
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,375
 Ashima. Hello

705
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,250
 Ashima

706
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,041

00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,541
 ...Is she your relative?

712
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,041
 Brother I was helping you.

713
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,000
Keep your help with yourself, and get out of here.

714
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,250
Seriously, the world just does not appreciate decency...

715
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,708
And why should I go that way, I'll go this way...

716
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,583
Get lost. - I am a sperm donor - What?

717
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,166
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

718
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,958
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

719
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,375
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

720
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,958
 Chaddha is on the pursuit

721
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,416
 Couldn't you knock before entering

722
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,375
 Why you are feeling shy?

723
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,333
Mummy papa have gone for a wedding. - I.T.O.

724
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,500

00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:46,000
...you know that Sunny and Bunty, they're always running after me...

729
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,416
...and that Pitampura guy, he's even bought a car...

730
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,833
I've got everyone hanging just for you...

731
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,916
Who are you showing attitude to... I've never stopped you...

732
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,791
 Fine, I'm just warning you...

733
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,958
...that there's a whole cue of boys waiting for me out there...

734
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,833

735
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,250
Shut the door... I've to change my shirt

736
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,875

738
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,333
 She thinks she is too smart.

739
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:11,625

00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,791

00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,375

744
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,333

00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:26,125

Alright, listen, listen, Don't introduce me, that's alright.

00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:33,625

751
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,916
Strange? You are forgetting your promise.

752

The love goddess will never forgive you...

753
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,833
 Oh Vicky!

754
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,083
 Congratulations.

755
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,791
We met at the bank. - Really

756
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,083
 Get my account opened

757
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:02,083
Hi. - How are you? - Very good.

758
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,166
 Hey... what's up

759
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,041
 Hi!

760
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:14,000
Looking sweet. Different... kind of cute

761
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,625
 Thank you.

762
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:19,291
 So, you're single.

763
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,708
 How would you know?

764
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:25,500
Otherwise your boyfriend would be sniffing around like a dog...

765
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,125
...guarding you... - Excuse me.

766
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,916
I am an independent working girl and not like other girls

767
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,083
I know. - Therefore don't even try.

768
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,166
 Why, working girls don't have affairs?

769
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,416
May be, but they definitely don't need..

770
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
 ..a boyfriend sniffing around them..

771
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,666
 ..atleast I don't

772
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,083
 Madam see... that depends...

773
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,375
 ...if you trap a simple, decent dog...

774
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:51,583
I mean boyfriend like me... then he is bound to sniff around...

775
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:55,375
 I am trapping you?

776
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:58,416
What crap? Don't forget you came here to speak to me...

777
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,875
Look... standing here alone..., all dressed up...

778
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,333
...these are the beginnings of setting the trap...

779
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,083
 These are the tactics.

780
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,958
I didn't know that I'd meet you here...

781
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,541
And if you would have known, you wouldn't have come dressed up?

782
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:15,333
 I wouldn't have come!

783
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,333
 Hi.

784
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,083
 You are back!!

785
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:31,000
No, am still stuck in traffic. Didn't sleep yet...

786
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:36,750
Your dad would snore all night, let out gas repeatedly...

787
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:40,166
I would fight that you are not letting me sleep...

788
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,791
I would then come to your room and sleep...

789
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,750
...and no sooner would I catch a wink than he'd come & call me...

790
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:51,875
...would hold my hand all night long...

791
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:56,583
...how do I suppose I'd feel sleepy now all alone?

792
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,000
 Shall I prepare a drink.

793
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,666
 No

794
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:08,041
I'll go in just five minutes and sleep down

795
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:26,833
By the way hundred percent we share some higher connection between...

796
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:28,916
 we keep bumping into each other...

797
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:31,291
first at the market, then on the road...

798
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:36,125
...then at the sangeet... quite unbelievable.

799
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:39,125
 Take the printout and get them signed.

800
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,541
Remove the life out of the computer... what're you so busy with...

801
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,208
...that you can't even spare a minute to respond...

802
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,833
...there's this dude sitting in front of you talking crap...

803
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,375
 ...atleast respond...

804
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,083
 Sir this is not my drawing room.

805
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:58,125
That I should entertain you... it's a bank...

806
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:01,666
Give me your address, drawing room, bedroom...

807
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,708
we could chat anywhere. even I am quite uncomfortable here

808
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,500
 Sorry.

809
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:19,875
Was telling you... to be seated quietly... now you've broken it...

810
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,041
 ...give you one tight one...

811
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,416
 Sir is that your son...

812
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,625
 ...yes he is my son.

813
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,125
No just think and be sure that he is your son.

814
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:29,750
 Yes he is my son.

815
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,458
Does anyone get his son to the bank for an outing...

816
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,916
 ...its the worlds most boring place...

817
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,666
 ...listen kid you carry on playing

818
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,416
 He's come here so many times.

819
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,166
I know he is an over the top guy, but he's cute.

820
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,166
 Come on your single enjoy it.

821
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:50,041
 Don't be a bore

822
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:51,541
 Enjoy

823
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,208
 What bore...

824
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:57,000
...why do you people feel that I don't want to be in a relationship.

825
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:59,625
 No listen. I have to be sure first.

826
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,875
Yes but atleast meet him once & as it is...

827
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,500
...who is asking you to have sex with him.

828
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,833
 Look at these marriage photos...

829
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,458

830
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,000
 See this one.

831
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:56,208

00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,500
 Ok let me call you back.

833
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,875
 Whose sample is this?

834
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,708
 Is everything ok.

835
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,666
 Ok. more than ok.

836
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,416
 I say unbelievable.

837
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,125
His sperm count is 100 million and motility rate is very strong.

838
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,708
 Outstanding.

839
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,083
 Who is this?

840
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,000
 Well, he's a foreigner...

841
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,916
 So finally you found your Alexander

842
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,333
 Dr. Trehan why are you joking with me.

843
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,125
Hello Chaman give an appointment to Bhatia.

844
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,750
Vicky! - Yes

845
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:35,083
Some Chaman had come by in the morning...

846
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,791
 ...and gave this sweet box...

847
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,958
 ...was saying there's some good news.

848
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,500
 When did he come.

849
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:42,291
 He had come early in the morning

850
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,125
 So how does it feel.

851
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:49,125
You've conceived for the first time... that too twins...

852
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:52,166
 I am darn sacred...

853
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:53,958
 I am darn sacred...

854
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:58,166
Meaning why the hell did you send the laddoos home...

855
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:01,250
...henceforth am not telling anyone that I am a sperm donor...

856
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:05,208
...the women are slapping me while your making me eat laddoos

857
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:08,625
You know... women they're just wired differently...

858
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:12,250
...god hasn't made such a woman who can understand a man...

859
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,541
...but you don't feel disappointed... it'll affect...

860
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:19,708
...and with such women... neither waste your time nor your sperm...

861
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,208
...seriously your sperm count is outstanding...

862
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:22,666
 first time in my career...

863
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,041
 lets give it another shot...

864
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:27,583
 No sir the world is very mean.

865
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:31,666
If everyone comes to know... doing nothing, am becoming a father...

866
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,708
 And if your clients spread the word...

867
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:37,500
...then mom will throw me out of the house...

868
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,833
 Why would the clients spread the news.

869
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:42,583
There is confidentiality clause in the contract

870
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:44,958
 Sir may I say something..

871
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:48,375
..I did this just once just to keep your word...

872
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,750
...now I don't want to make a habit out of it...

873
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,541
 No no make it a habit.

874
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,708

...I am telling you... don't increase my BP...

884
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,500
 Ya mom I'll explain later

885
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:22,000
 TV.

886
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:24,416
LCD! - LCD... and this is just the beginning...

887
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,333
Bhatia has sent the LCD in celebration of his twins.

888
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:31,166
Now you wait and watch what all you'll get both...

889
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,541
 ...in cash and in kind...

890
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,291
...there is much to enjoy for a sperm like you

891
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,125
 What would be the cost of LCD

892
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:39,500
 Fifty to sixty thousand.

893
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,000
 Sir why don't you understand.

894
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,250
 Technically I have become a father...

895
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,791
 ...and it feels really strange

896
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,458
 What feeling my dear

897
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,791
 Just do what you feel like doing...

898
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,333
eat well, sleep well, and dress well...

899
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,458
...don't take stress... it'll affect your sperms

900
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:59,708
All the time sperm sperm. Cant you ever think of anything else...

901
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,208
 Listen listen...

902
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,791
I get like over a thousand biodatas everyday...

903
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,291
...with people applying to be sperm donors...

904
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,041
 ...ask Chaman if you wish to...

905
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:12,416
If you had so much choice why did you select me.

906
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,875
 Listen... sit... sit...

907
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:20,333
...call it 20 years experience or 6th sense...

908
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:23,458
I can tell a good sperm just by looking at a man's face...

909
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:26,500
 You're taking my case...

910
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:29,000
 See your report, its brilliant.

911
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,541
Such DNA belong only to the true Aryans...

00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,500
...you're the son of an Aryan you bloody...

914
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,833
 Confused sperm.

915
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,375
 Listen

916
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:54,750
Have you ever heard the name of Alexander?

917
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,333
 Your DNA belongs to his family.

918
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,750
 What are you talking?

919
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:01,291
 Listen listen. One minute.

920
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:04,291
 Look... whats written here...

00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,666
Map - Map

922
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,833
 What's written here...

923
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,916
 The conquest of Alexander the Great

924
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,458
Look this is Macedonia, Alexander's country...

925
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,583
from here he takes off... continues continues...

926
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:17,458
reaches here Asia Minor meaning Turkey...

927
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,791
from Turkey he takes off straight, then left then again left and...

928
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,750
 ...then a right and reaches Persia...

929
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:27,541
...after crossing Persia.. and via Hindukush he entered into INDIA...

930
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:32,708
...but before he reached INDIA... he had many marriages...

931
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:36,166
...post marriage left his soldiers behind...

932
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,625
Alexander's soldiers and local women had sex...

933
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:45,000
...and married each other... and had their children... understood...

934
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:48,291
...and you guys came here only after the partition right?

935
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:50,166
And Lajpat nagar Is full of refugees...

936
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,458
...you also are a refugee right.. so all this happened right there...

937
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:59,875
what I am trying to say is that you are a pure Aryan race!

938
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,083
 Don't believe me do you...

939
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,375
look this is history and this is science...

940
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,666
they both go along together... parallel

941
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,041
 I am a man of science

942
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,250
We can not go on together... parallel...

943
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,416
 ...just drop me home please

944
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:20,541
Listen... the sperm count of an Aryan is best in the world.

945
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,708
I get all types of demands from overseas...

946
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:29,333
...sperm samples of Brad Pitt, Shahrukh Khan, Lady Gaga, Beckham.

947
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:34,583
Clients demand the sperm samples of such celebrities...

948
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,458
Now you please tell me where am I to get their samples from...

949
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,000
...but since there is a demand we would have to meet it

950
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,041
How? - You are there na...

951
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,583
You play cricket so you are my Dhoni...

952
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,166
...handsome you already are, so there is my Beckham...

953
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,416
you dance, sing well... there you go - Lady Gaga...

954
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:58,166
and drama is inborn in us Indians... so you become my Shahrukh...

955
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:02,541
...consumer is happy and so is the manufacturer...

956
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,416
 Sir increase my rate then...

957
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,041
 Idiot.

958
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,500
 Greedy sperm...

959
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:35,791
"When this little flower bud blooms into a plant"

960
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:41,916
 "It blooms into a bud."

961
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,791
 Hey, iPhone has come.

962
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,291
 This is a 16GB one.

963
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,625
 Dear, I had asked for a 32 GB one.

964
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,000
 Cheers.

965
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,708
 It blooms into a bud

966
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:54,458
 And so does the demand for this...

967
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:59,375
...that and just about everything that money can buy

968
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,541
 Dolly Arora..

969
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:04,083
Didn't you say Rs.5,000 per month? This is 5,000..

970
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,208
 From where did you get this money?

971
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:08,416
 We want the best quality sperm

972
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:15,625
 Don't worry about the money

973
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,666
We're getting demand from foreign countries...

974
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:20,916
 Give me cash.

975
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,666
Cash. - Cash.

976
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,208
I need a good quality Indian sperm donor.

977
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,750
 Cash. Give me cash.

978
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,791
 Cash.

979
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,791
 Mrs. Bhatia breathe...

980
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,208
 Take a deep breath...

981
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:51,291
When this little plant turns into a big tree

982
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:56,333
 Turns into a big tree

983
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:08,000
The feeling takes over to live big, in style and live free

984
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,833
 "And so does the demand for this..."

985
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:14,750
"...that and just about everything that money can buy"

986
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:21,750
"As the wants are unlimited and even bigger than the sky"

987
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:49,625
Hey, Mom. I am late. I will try and make it as soon as I can.

988
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,833
 Ok bye.

989
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,875
 Auto.

990
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:04,291
What are you doing madam. Delhi is not safe in night. Come.

991
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:13,666
 First CR park please

992
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,916
 So, how's work at the bank going...

993
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,041
...but you have quite an interesting awesome job...

994
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:21,375
...just sit back and count others' cash...

995
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,583
Don't you get bored... Tell me seriously.. truthfully..

996
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,541
Meaning there isn't a single guy in the bank..

997
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:32,750
..whom you could check out... do time pass.. really.

998
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:36,625
I go there for work, not to check out guys

999
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:40,041
 As I told you, I am not interested.

1000
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:44,250
 That's the problem... just chill...

1001
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:48,375
...take life lightly... else you'll be frustrated all life long

1002
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,833
Well, am I the frustrated one or you...

1003
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:55,375
You. - ...who was checking out those useless magazines.

1004
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,625
 O.K. so I did see those magazines...

1005
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,625
but didn't buy a single one... check if you wish to...

1006
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,291
 Please Take left in the street.

1007
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,666
 Here's your Bengali colony

1008
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:08,208
 Ashima...

1009
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:11,291
 ...no bye... no thanks...

1010
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,875
 Am not that bad...

1011
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:20,833
 Good night.

1012
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:24,416
Sir by the way you could have done much.

1013
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,000
 Just take it to Lajpat Nagar

1014
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,541
 You're a smart chap...

1015
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,083
 Don't talk crap... lets go

1016
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,875
 This way.

1017
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,083
 Hi!

1018
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:46,750
Hi I am sorry I got late... too much traffic...

1019
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,625
 uhh should we order for lunch?

1020
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,958
Obviously but I thought you would not come.

1021
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:56,166
Now that night you dropped me at home safely

1022
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:59,666
...didn't even take the money for auto also, so one lunch is O.K.

1023
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:02,083
 I was going home in the auto anyways.

1024
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:05,875
 Anyway where do you work.

1025
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,583
What. - Where do you work.

1026
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:13,875
I am looking for a job and for time being I am in export import.

1027
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,250
 Of what?

1028
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,250
Handicrafts - Really!

1029
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,875
Yeah. - Really my dad was working in Handicraft Emporium.

1030
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:23,875
 I mean he is retired now

1031
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,500
 What happened, what so funny...

1032
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:33,791
What happened, what's so funny... so are you single

1033
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,375
You want to confirm before having an affair

1034
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,541
 No I am just asking you.

1035
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:40,833
 I hardly know you.

1036
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:43,333
 I don't want have an affair with you.

1037
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:46,208
 Then how come you've come for a date.

1038
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,166
 I just came.

1039
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:51,541
 It is not a date.

1040
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,291
 O.K. leave it.

1041
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,583
 Have I held you as yet

1042
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,541
 You always talk like this.

1043
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,083
 I talk like that also.

1044
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,541
 Ma'am, your order please.

1045
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,166
"There is a reason" - Bye.

1046
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,208

00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,708
 There is a reason

1050
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:31,833
 for this restlessness

1051
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:34,291
 I like you

1052
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,750

There was once some disinterest. - Hello.

1054
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:46,708
 Now I have found peace, limitless

1055
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:49,875
 Bye.

1056
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,791
Let me be lost - I am getting late.

1057
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,291
 Let me be lost

1058
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:55,583
 Today no bank

1059
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,208
 Why... I never bunked

1060
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,958
 There is always a first time.

1061
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,041
 But why? Yeah, tomorrow..

1062
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,375
 Let me be lost

1063
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,166
 She is having a burger. Call later.

1064
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:11,541
 Let me be lost. Its time to love

1065
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:16,125
 It's time to love you

1066
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:17,625
 Let me be lost

1067
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,666
 Let me lose myself

1068
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,416
 Let me be lost

1069
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:27,833
 It's not the weather, it's the heart

1070
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:33,166
 You are unique, the rest is useless

1071
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,083
 It was a colourless evening

1072
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,583
 It was a colourless evening

1073
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:43,000
 There is a lot of enjoyment

1074
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:46,375
 Let me be lost

1075
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,166
 Let me lose myself

1076
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,916
 Let me be lost

1077
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 Let me lose myself

1078
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:55,708
 Let me be lost

1079
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:58,541
 Let me lose myself

1080
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,833
 Panditji what happened?

1081
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:05,333
Vicky Pepsi aunty was asking me what you do.

1082
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,791
 I told her to ask you herself.

1083
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:11,041
Whatever you all are planning, send it out of boundary.

1084
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,791
 See my dear there is no hurry.

1085
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 But one thing let me tell you...

1086
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:19,708
...that I really think you and Sweta look really sweet together

1087
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:24,000
See son now you have started earning, so get married.

1088
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,083
Today your telling me to get married...

1089
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:28,791
...tomorrow you'll tell me to have kids... - Right.

1090
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:32,750
if its only about kids, then I can have them today itself...

1091
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,250
 Vicky.

1092
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:50,416
 Why did you kiss me and all of that?

1093
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,916
That night I was drunk, after that have I ever touched you...

1094
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,416
 ...put on your dupatta

1095
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,708
Put on my dupatta... Why're you ignoring me.

1096
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,625
 You were drunk just that one night...

1097
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,583
...what about the other nights. - What other nights.

1098
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,125
 I never touched you.

1099
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,375
 Did I ever stop you.

1100
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:10,083
See the door is open, put your veil, somebody could see us...

1101
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:12,500
..are you crazy, what are you doing... get away from me

1102
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,166
Look if you don't want to do marriage now then O.K.

1103
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:19,833
 I will convince to mummy..

1104
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:22,125
but don't break our relationship in this way...

1105
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:23,791
 What relationship...

1106
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,750
I have already told you that we are just childhood friends

1107
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,250
 dont raise false hopes...

1108
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:28,416
 So you do all that with a friend..

1109
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,166
..that one should do with a girlfriend.

1110
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:36,166
 Aren't you feeling anything...

1111
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:41,250
...just troubling me aren't you... or you've found somebody else...

1112
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,208
 There's no one else...

1113
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,625
...and even If there is why should I tell you... bloody pile on...

1114
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,625
Hooo.. when that you've done everything with me I've become a pile on

1115
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:53,041
I even given you all my pocket money...

1116
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,083
now you give me back all my money - Enough.

1117
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,750
 There... shown your real self...

1118
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:59,791
Bloody typical C block mentality... here take this...

1119
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,375
...here here take all your money... haven't even counted it

1120
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:05,375
I will take my money and now you see... what I do...

1121
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,583
I will tell everything to aunty... open up all your secrets

1122
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:09,750
 What secrets? What you will tell.

1123
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:12,541
Yes I know everything about you and the doctor...

1124
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,166
I know all that's going on between the two of you...

1125
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,375
 What do you know.

1126
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:19,583
That you're getting your treatment done

1127
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:25,125
Treatment... hahahah... Go, go, tell everyone...

1128
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:28,125
 Yes I will tell to the entire colony.

1129
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,041
 You go to hell. You take your money.

1130
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,083
now I'll show you when you come to me...

1131
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:34,416
 And one more thing...

1132
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:39,875
One day or other all this will come out in the open.

1133
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:47,500
I've become habituated to earning quick money thanks to you...

1134
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,875
 What is wrong in this?

1135
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:53,416
As it is what does a boyfriend and girl friend do with each other...

1136
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,833
Why? - Eating burgers at Wimpy's. Some kisses... some touching...

1137
01:00:57,916 --> 01:01:01,666
...now they aren't going to have kids right.. all wastage of sperm...

1138
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:06,208
 Listen now you be away from all these.

1139
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:07,666
 All the time

1140
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,791
You land up connecting such diverse topics with each other...

1141
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,166
If I listen to you... I'll land up dying a bachelor

1142
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:18,166
 Come on your job.

1143
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:28,208
 Hello. Me, hi I'm on the treadmill...

1144
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,791
 ...what are you doing in parlour?

1145
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,458
Hadn't you refused me? Are you out of your mind?

1146
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,750
You hang in there, am coming. Stay there. Okay bye.

1147
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:37,583
 What are you doing here?

1148
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:40,750
Extremely sorry sir, not today please next time double

1149
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,375
 Just give a little bit.

1150
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:44,000
 Give some atleast...

1151
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,291
Hey have called for some sweets from Tiwaris...

1152
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:48,541
 Send them home...

1153
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,416
 Ma'am, your driver is waiting...

1154
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,833
 Leave that.

1155
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,041
 Mom... here's the money...

1156
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:02,125
 Thank you aunty I will be back. Bye.

1157
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:10,458
 O stranger from distant lands

1158
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:17,750
Your home is across the seas... O, dear foreigner

1159
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:21,875
I could not understand anything... but you sing beautifully...

1160
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:24,291
 This was mom's favourite song...

1161
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:28,791
...5 year's back she died, since then... - Sir tea.

1162
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:31,000
In the house there's only myself, dad and Peeshi

1163
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,375
 One thing's for sure...

1164
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,458
 ...your children will become singers

1165
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:41,791
 Meaning

1166
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:45,708
Genes, after all they will have an effect.

1167
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,458
Really. - Well do you love children.

1168
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,041
You love kids. - I'm ok

1169
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,000
 I love kids

1170
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:56,958
You love kids - I love them.

1171
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,166
 I am also a kid only.

1172
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:08,250
 "Unsaid things get colored"

1173
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:15,291
"You start calling a person your very own"

1174
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,625
 Sir its coming switched off.

1175
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,833
 Yes.

1176
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:30,666
Suddenly how come you made a plan to meet?

1177
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:33,541
 I want to tell you something.

1178
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,625
 Tell me.

1179
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,583
 I am a divorcee

1180
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:47,708
I knew it. I knew there had to be something...

1181
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,041
 ...that you're forever cranky...

1182
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,250
When you smile, it seems you are doing a favour.

1183
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,333
 What's the story?

1184
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,541
3 years back we had an arranged marriage.

1185
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:01,875
 The boy was from DU. A Banker.

1186
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:03,750
 Oh would be earning well.

1187
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,583
Sorry. - Yes.

1188
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:08,750
 Then what happened.

1189
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:13,166
Nothing, on our first night of marriage, I came to know that...

1190
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:19,666
...he loved somebody else and married me only under family pressure.

1191
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,708
 I don't know why he kept it a secret.

1192
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:27,375
Should have told me. - They are sissies... Bengalis. They are scared.

1193
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,708
 I am not like that.

1194
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:30,208
 What happened after that?

1195
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:33,458
Nothing, caught an auto in the middle of the night..

1196
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,541
 ..and came back to my house.

1197
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:38,833
He did not even find it necessary to drop me home.

1198
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:42,750
Ha, that's not a marriage there, you didn't even have sex...

1199
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,166
Besides you had to spend on the bridals...

1200
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,583
If you had got it done from mom, you would have got 50% back.

1201
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,708
Well when you meet mom, avoid the divorce matter.

1202
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:58,875
Why. - We're Punjabis... conservative... not modern like you all

1203
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:02,000
 And you.

1204
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:07,625
I am okay. Single, double, divorcee. Everything is cool for me.

1205
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:10,250
 Do you have a secret...

1206
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,750
 No.

1207
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:16,708
 735 friends on Orkut

1208
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,208
 750 on Facebook...

1209
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,583
 And this is the profile picture

1210
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,791
All details are totally correct. You can check it whenever...

1211
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:27,000
 Why are we here...

1212
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,666
 ...what do you want from me.

1213
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,291
 Don't know Ashima...

1214
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:44,750
But since I've met you... I feel I can't live without...

1215
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:48,000
It's like you've become a habit... first when I met you at the bank...

1216
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:54,583
I was like what kind of girl is she... then I was like...

1217
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:57,458
...no however she is... she's just fine...

1218
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,416
...to make you smile sort of became my responsibility...

1219
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,125
...after dropping you at home in the evening...

1220
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:04,458
...and then picking you up in the morning...

1221
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,916
 ...and the time in between...

1222
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,875
 ..bloody just doesn't pass...

1223
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,000
...but why've you asking me all this...

1224
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,458
 Because even I have fallen for you.

1225
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,708
 I want to marry you.

1226
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,958
 I want kids a family...

1227
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:38,541
...but that's ok... it's not necessary...

1228
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:42,083
 ...for you to have similar feelings...

1229
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,291
 Maybe you don't want to settle down...

1230
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,291
 So you can let me know

1231
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:54,166
Come, let's go to your Kaalibadi and get married.

1232
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:00,083
 I am serious Vicky.

1233
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:01,291
 I am also serious.

1234
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:10,458
Listen... this 'Peeshi' in your house...

1235
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:12,958
 Is she your cat or dog...

1236
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,250
 Peeshi means aunt.

1237
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,833
 Do you drink

1238
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:43,041
 "The purity of water"

1239
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,875
 "The purity of water"

1240
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,333
 It's nice... a little blue though

1241
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:52,958
 Sit comfortably

1242
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,250
I like it... - Really?

1243
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,750
 "Brings a tear to my eyes"

1244
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,583
 Brings a tear to my eyes

1245
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:11,000
 My beloved didn't show up

1246
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:16,166
 My beloved didn't show up

1247
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,708
 My love didn't show up

1248
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:21,041
 My beloved didn't show up

1249
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:23,583
 My beloved didn't show up

1250
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,625
 "My love didn't show up"

1251
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:29,625
You know what a drunken bengalan looks...

1252
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:31,125
 Take a look at yourself in the mirror.

1253
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,208
 You are drunk

1254
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,458
 Father's at home...

1255
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:39,416
 Peeshi?

1256
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:44,625
 So do we play ludo sitting here?

1257
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:48,333
 Brings a tear to my eyes

1258
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,625
 Your absence has made me go crazy

1259
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,875
 Come back, my beloved

1260
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:57,500
 Your absence has made me go crazy

1261
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:00,000
 Come back, my beloved

1262
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,458
 Seasons have come and gone

1263
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,583
 You still haven't come, my love

1264
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:07,291
 Seasons have come and gone

1265
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,166
 You still haven't come, my love

1266
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:13,708
 When I saw your divine eyes

1267
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:19,750
 When I saw your divine eyes

1268
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:22,666
 A tear came to my eye

1269
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:27,750
 A tear came to my eye

1270
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,500
 A tear came to my eye

1271
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:39,125
 On the terrace when we would meet

1272
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,708
I will call you. - Ok. Correct...

1273
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:42,375
Bye - Bye

1274
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:49,166
 I'm crazy about you. I love you

1275
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,708
 You won't find anyone like me

1276
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:57,791
 Forego the world and come back to me

1277
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:03,125
 Forego the world and come back to me

1278
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:06,583
 Brings a tear to my eyes

1279
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:08,791
 A tear came to my eye

1280
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,541
 A tear came to my eye

1281
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,791
 A tear came to my eye

1282
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:16,833
 A tear came to my eye

1283
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,958
What is all this going on in your life?

1284
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:21,958
 Nothing. What is going on?

1285
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:24,750
 Lying doesn't suit you

1286
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,208
 Who is this Ashima?

1287
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,375
 We are getting married

1288
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,625
Listen... dating and shating is fine...

1289
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,916
...chilling out, going out Is fine... but marriage.

1290
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:41,125
Listen understand the importance of bachelorhood...

1291
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:45,333
In bachelorhood you can eat when you want, drink when you want...

1292
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:49,291
...the toothpaste cap will remain wherever you left it...

1293
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:51,916
...but after marriage you'll lose this freedom.

1294
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 And from the client's point of view..

1295
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,666
 ..the value of bachelor's sperm is...

1296
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,250
Every time you just talk about sperm... sperm... sperm

1297
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,041
It's been four years... my mind has gotten rusted...

1298
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:03,541
Rise above the sperm there is a heart also.

1299
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:07,750
 Chaddha sir what about love?

1300
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,166
Your dad's never going to accept this...

1301
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,208
 Why Peeshi ma?

1302
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:24,958
Why... you know don't talk like as if you don't understand...

1303
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,125
North Indian...aethe uthey kithey... oh god...ssss...

1304
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,666
 cant even think about it...

1305
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:33,333
 you know they don't even take off..

1306
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:35,375
 ..the price tags from their clothes...

1307
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:38,416
and then they'll say 'Oh I made a mistake...'

1308
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,875
 Ok just meet him once

1309
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,458
 No this match is NOT possible at all

1310
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,291
 Showed you so many girls...

1311
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,250
and finally you chose to find yourself a Bengali...

1312
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,625
 Ashima Roy...have you lost it?

1313
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,916
Her name itself is so bitter, what'll she be like...

1314
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,333
do you know how dominating these girls are...

1315
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,333
and why do I have to adjust everytime...

1316
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:00,666
I am not going to adjust this time, I will not...

1317
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:05,083
...first get dominated by in laws then by this Bengali bride...

1318
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:08,541
...listen carefully, only a Punjabi bride will enter this house...

1319
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,750
 ...and that too a fair & pretty one...

1320
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,541
 else go get married all by yourself!

1321
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:16,166
Even if no one goes, I will definitely go to your marriage...

1322
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,250
and that too wearing a suit by Ritu Kumar

1323
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,166
Grandmom, you don't interfere...please don't...

1324
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,500
I have only one son...and he'll get a Bengali bride...?

1325
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:25,291
 Listen they are really big misers...

1326
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:29,166
I challenge you, show me one such Bengali in the whole world...

1327
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,625
...who lives like us...with a big heart...

01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,250
...and their food...FISH...bitter oil...

01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:37,833

1330
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:39,875

01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,708
Mom please ya...atleast meet her just once

1332
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,500
I am not going to meet that Bengali woman

1333
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:44,958
 She is not typical.

1334
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,833
 Everytime something good happens...

1335
01:12:47,916 --> 01:12:49,583
...she has to spread sadness...that's her habit

1336
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:51,750
Your grandfather, wanted to make you a sardar...

1337
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,041
 I was the one who opposed it...

1338
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:57,125
...and now this Bengali woman, she's going to make you a monkey...

1339
01:12:57,208 --> 01:13:00,958
...will make you wear a monkey cap and rubber chappals...

1340
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:04,791
then don't come to me crying... mumma save me... help help help

1341
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:09,208
Ignore all that...you tell me... does she look like Moon Moon Sen?

1342
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:11,041
Better than that... - Ya...

1343
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,458
Yes - Show me a photo...

I am going to sponsor your honeymoon trip... - Yes.

1349
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,791
 Oye why did you stop this...continue.

1350
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:36,625
 What is this you are doing?

1351
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,541
 You know I hate North Indians...

1352
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:44,041
I mean you're an independent, modern, smart, Bengali woman...

1353
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:48,291
 and he ARORA, Punjabi!

1354
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:52,291
We have our culture, literature, music...

1355
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:54,458
...this just won't match, no match at all...

1356

01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,000
...and what culture are you talking about...?

1360
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,708
About that son-in-law of yours who didn't have the guts...

1361
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,208
...to speak the truth that he already loved somebody else...

1362
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:18,458
...he was your cultured, well read Bengali...right?

1363
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:22,375
Vicky's not like that... he genuinely cares for me baba...

1364
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:26,166
That's because he has some personal agenda...they are selfish people

1365
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,583
Ya he does have an agenda baba...he wants to marry me

1366
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:29,916
 Where does he work?

1367

 Own business.

1368
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,875
 What?

1369
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:36,375
 No no this marriage cannot happen...

1370
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:40,625
...your uncle's son-in-law, can't you find a boy like him...

1371
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:42,541
I don't care papa... - What?

1372
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:45,333

Fish. a man's character can be known from the way he buys his fish...

01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,541
 ...he has to pass the fish test first.

1379
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,083
 He does not eat fish.

1380
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:10,916
Couldn't you find a Bengali boy to fall in love with?

if your mom was alive...she would have told you...

1391
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:51,833
when I used to hug her tight...she would ummm feel shy...

1392
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,458
 ...and ask me to loosen up...

1393
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:58,625
...and don't tell me Punjabis are better than us.

1394

01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:42,250
 Sorry dear

1408
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,458
Fine don't come...but never try calling me ever again...

1409
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,000
 I hate Punjabis.

1410
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:52,500
 I can understand.

1411
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:56,166
...our nature is different ... and further more they are Aroras...

1412
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,916
...didn't I tell you these Bengalis don't like us Punjabis

1413
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,708
 I hate Delhi also.

1414
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:07,000
Sir, which means you haven't seen Delhi well enough...

1415
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:11,458
I am happy in my CR Park my Bengali colony.

1416
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:14,541
 By the way...that too is Delhi sir

1417
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,958
 Are you his uncle? No no.

1418
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:22,208
Business partner professional uncle you can say.

1419
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:23,500
 What is your business.

1420
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,791
Trading Trading...no investments...only profits

1421
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,250
Sir...you didn't tell us why you hate Punjabis

1422
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:33,041
 Because we believe in simplicity...

1423
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:35,708
Not like Punjabis who are only show offs.

1424
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:39,750
I agree with you madam...Our cultures just don't match...

1425
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:43,125
I was explaining him this only that there will be a problem...

1426
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:45,250
 See understanding

1427
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,166
Sir understanding is very important sir...

1428
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,666
If the two of us have an understanding..

1429
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,000
 ..all problems will get solved...

1430
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,541
...and I know a little bit about Bengalis

1431
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:55,791
 I see what do you know about Bengalis.

1432
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:57,458
 They love fish...

1433
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,791
 Sir, they're intelligent...

1434
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,250
 jana gana mana adhinayak...

1435
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:07,750
...our national anthem was written by gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore...

1436
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:10,666
and sir Mohan... - Mohan.

1437
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,250
Football. - Football

1438
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,500
Mohan Bagan - Sir, that guy plays brilliant football

1439
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:17,541
Guy... it's a team, it's a football team...

1440
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:21,541
He made a team...and your 'elder sister' sir

1441
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,375
 elder sister...elder sister Mamata

1442
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:28,750
Ya...that very same elder sister is the 11th chief minister of West Bengal

1443
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:38,375
 Sorry, sir.

1444
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:42,666
 Tuna.

1445
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,333
 Yes Baba

1446
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,666
 Bring the tea

1447
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,041
 I'll bring the starters

1448
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,291
Mrs. Arora - Yes.

1449
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:57,583
I hope Vicky has informed you that Ashima is a divorcee

1450
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,958
 Divorcee? Vicky you didn't...

1451
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:04,958
 This is too much.

1452
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:08,583
Oh such a fine girl...you don't look like it at all...

1453
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:11,291
anyways all for good...that fellow's loss and Vicky's gain...

1454
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:15,083
Now whatever grandmom decides would be the final word

1455
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:16,791
Listen you don't have any children do you...

1456
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:19,916
O grandmom, what's the difference, we either say yes or no...

1457
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,750
whichever way lets decide fast...what's the big deal!.

1458
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:23,000
 For me she's absolutely Ok...

1459
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:27,333
 Dolly for me she's absolutely fine...

1460
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:31,000
 You know Dolly...Vicky's mother...

1461
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,291
Vicky's father Gurmeet passed away very young...

1462
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:37,000
...and she became a widow at a very young age...

1463
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:41,000
if it was upto me I would have gotten her remarried...

1464
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,916
 why spend your whole life sad & alone?

1465
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I appreciate your progressive thinking.

1466
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,458
 Thank you.

1467
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:50,416
If Vicky's fine, then even we don't have any problem...

1468
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,875
..after all we're also modern people... right...

1469
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,083
 congratulations dear...

1470
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,291
 Your husband didn't come ma'am

1471
01:19:56,375 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh I never married...ummm... I didn't find the right man

1472
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,458
 Oh...you should have told me...

1473
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:03,416
I would have lined up right men for you...

1474
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:07,333
Mr. Rai there must be tremendous pressure on you

1475
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:10,750
Why? - Daughter is a divorcee and sister bachelor

1476
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:12,500
And you widow. - You...

1477
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:17,041
How old must you be. - Excuse me, can we talk about the wedding

1478
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:21,083
See, we don't want a loud marriage...not loud at all...

1479
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:23,625
and the marriage should follow the Bengali traditions

1480
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:26,125
No no no no...the marriage will be done by Punjabi traditions...

1481
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:28,083
...after all it's our son's first marriage...

1482
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:32,041
so many known people...they're all waiting to be invited...

1483
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:35,791

1484
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,333
No no no what is she saying. - Listen.. I

1485
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,958

...let these bongs speak what they wish to...uh anything else

1488
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:48,000

 goes on in your Punjabi marriages...

1490
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:52,000
 I personally feel that..

1491
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,208
..all that should not happen in a marriage ceremony

1492
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:57,250
 Our family really does not like that.

1493
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:01,708
 Rum, rum, rum.

1494
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,041

01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:07,875
Thank you thank you. What I was saying was that...

1549
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:09,916
...the terrace room is not big enough for the two of you

1550
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,750
..why don't we take a two bedroom flat some where nearby.

1551
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:13,916
 No mummy we will manage. Why Vicky.

1552
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,875
Mrs. Arora listen I am shifting to Kolkata...

1553
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:18,291
 ...and the entire house will be empty.

1554
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,041
 They can easily shift there.

1555
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:22,458
 No no but they will be away from us.

1556
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:23,875
Whose phone is it? - See...

1557

1558
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,166
Dr. Chaddha you're really strange I've...

1559
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,916
...just been married... don't you have any patience...

1560
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,833
See this is a politician family and I am under pressure.

1561
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:33,625
 Don't refuse, this is a big deal..

1562
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:34,833
..and I have already made a commitment.

1563
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:36,500
If you refuse, I'll be in big trouble...

1564
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:37,958
 And What about the problem that'll...

1565
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
 Vicky relax...think with cool mind.

1566
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,375
On a later day, if this child becomes tomorrow's Prime Minister...

1567
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:45,750
...then you can proudly say Vicky Arora's son is the Prime Minister.

1568
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:48,500
 Who are you explaining to?

1569
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:49,833
 Listen stop giving me this crap...

1570
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:53,875
The risk has increased...you will cause a break up in my marriage.

1571
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:55,041
 Okay bye.

1572
01:24:57,416 --> 01:24:59,000
 Complicated sperm.

1573
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,541
 That bag?

1574
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:07,000
Two minutes. - Okay, I will get it.

1575
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:11,250
Have some shame... and tell that Dr. Chaddha never again...

1576
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:13,041
 Go now...

1577
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,750

01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,666
Ready. - Come on

1579
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:19,750

01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:20,916
 No one...

1581
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:29,208
 Moments.. these moments..

1582
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,541
 These moments of mine...

1583
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:37,666
This is our exotic honeymoon destination. - Yes yes absolutely

1584
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,625
People go to Bangkok and we've come to Kolkata. - O.K. Bye

1585
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,416
 So how do we like it.

1586
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:46,666
Feels good... just place a bed here...in the open air

1587
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,000
 Ok.

1588
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:53,250
This mosquito net, reminds me of cricket's net practice

1589
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:56,291
 I will die without you

1590
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,916
 I will die without you

1591
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:09,750
 I will die without you

1592
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:16,833
 I will die without you

1593
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:18,666
 This was just net practice...

1594
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:21,541
 ...lets play again...

1595
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:25,541
 I will die without you

1596
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:26,791
 Mummy drinks

1597
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:31,250
After dad's death she became very lonely...

1598
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:37,166
so gets relaxed taking one or two pegs...feels good...

1599
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:39,958
 That's true cool ya

1600
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:44,500
You know I wish to change my profession, start something new

1601
01:26:44,916 --> 01:26:46,041
 Why?

1602
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:48,333
 Its enough. Don't feel interested...

1603
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:51,666
But there is money in your account. I've seen it

1604
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,625
 Any way whatever makes you happy...

1605
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,208
meanwhile drop me to the bank and in the evening pick me up. - Okay.

1606
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,458
 Just like that Vicky has flown away...

1607
01:27:05,416 --> 01:27:07,000
 ...gone out of our hands...

1608
01:27:07,291 --> 01:27:09,791
 How much more would you use him...

1609
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,666
...now get used to being without him...look for someone else...

1610
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:14,791
if we can get 5-6 months more with him, be grateful...

1611
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,000
 I won't be coming tomorrow...

1612
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,791
 Pain in the sperm.

1613
01:27:24,541 --> 01:27:26,250
Doctor will be available tomorrow morning.

1614
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,833
 Excuse me where does Dr. Shobha sit

1615
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:30,583
Third room to your left. - From here? - Yes.

1616
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,708
 Ashima are you fine?

1617
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,833
 Are you fine?

1618
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:44,125
Why are you crying...tell me what did the doctor say?

1619
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:51,208
 Ashima has tubal blockage.

1620
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:52,833
 I have read her reports...

1621
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:55,875
...she would never conceive in the natural process

1622
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:58,625
 Doctor she's still quite young...

1623
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:01,833
...there must be some treatment or way-out.

1624
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:03,833
 I understand your point Mr. Arora...

1625
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:06,041
...but some times the body is just not well..

1626
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:07,708
 ..equipped for the pregnancy.

1627
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:10,208
I would not like to give you any false hopes...

1628
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:13,458
...but right now you need to support Ashima...

1629
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:16,375
 ...emotional and psychologically...

1630
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:30,416
 Vicky don't joke with me.

1631
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,958
 Never.

1632
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,041
 What happened.

1633
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:48,916
 Tuna can not have baby.

1634
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:53,500
 Is she alright.

1635
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:57,500
 Ashima say something...

1636
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:02,291
 What do I say...

1637
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:08,458
..the entire world can have kids except me

1638
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:10,916
 Don't think like this. Its destiny.

1639
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,000
 Destiny?

1640
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,916
 This is my destiny.

1641
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:20,791
You're speaking as if I haven't tried hard enough...

1642
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:23,291
 We'll consult some other doctor.

1643
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,291
Haven't a child is not everything is it...

1644
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:31,208
 But for me it is.

1645
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:34,250
 Our child...

1646
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:38,625
 ...half punjabi, half Bengali...

1647
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:43,333
 ...half Delhi, half Kolkata...

1648
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:49,458
 ...half Vicky and half Ashima...

1649
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:53,416
If you keep crying like this...even I feel really bad...

1650
01:29:54,916 --> 01:29:57,125
..to divert the mind let's go out some where...

1651
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,875
 let's sit there and discuss...

1652
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:01,208
 Okay?

1653
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:32,250
Such things happen in today's life style.

1654
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:34,875
 What can we do...

1655
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
 Listen adopt.

1656
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:40,625
Grandmom our blood is our own after all...

1657
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:47,041
See I am the head of family, rest is upto Ashima...

1658
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:50,500
Grandmom there are only two things modern in Delhi...

1659
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:54,625
 ...one is Metro and other you.

1660
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,875
You know I don't know about this adoption and all.

1661
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,375
 I have not thought about it.

1662
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:02,333
I don't know whether we will be able to give so much love...

1663
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:03,791
 ...to another's child

1664
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:07,750
I don't know. Anyways I'm feeling sleepy...

1665
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:13,041
Vicky this is only my report, not yours.

1666
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:16,041
Where are your reports? We did your tests right.

1667
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:19,416
 No.

1668
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:21,041
 What?

1669
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:22,583
 No.

1670
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:23,916
 Why not.

1671
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:27,041
 What problem would I have? I am fine.

1672
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:28,541
 How can you be so sure?

1673
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,750
Every one will think that I have a problem...

1674
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,041
What if there is some problem with you...

1675
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:33,333
Fine, we'll do it tomorrow. Don't get stressed

1676
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:35,458
No one minute... the question is not that we'll do it tomorrow...

1677
01:31:35,541 --> 01:31:38,375
...the question is why didn't you get you're your tests done. Why?

1678
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:46,875
Because...earlier I was used to donate sperm...

1679
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:52,166
I was a sperm donor...I was a sperm donor...

1680
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:05,541
 It was before marriage.

1681
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:14,083
So what about those... handicrafts...Trading business.

1682
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:21,166
 Oh now I get it...

1683
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:25,916
Why didn't not tell me...I am a divorcee...still I told you right.

1684
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,875
It was a marriage of only a few hours still I told you...

1685
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,291
...because I wanted you to know everything about my life.

1686
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,083
How could you hide such a big thing from me...

1687
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:35,375
Why is it so important for you men to hide things.

1688
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:37,000
 Look at me when I am talking to you.

1689
01:32:37,291 --> 01:32:38,750
 What would I have told you...

1690
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:40,458
 No you think now I will understand.

1691
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:43,250
What would I have told you...that I donate sperm.

1692
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:45,750
I used to get myself tested for pregnancy...

1693
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,541
It would come out negative... I used to cry for hours...

1694
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:50,666
And you used to, very calmly console me...

1695
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:55,250
now I know why...you were already had children

1696
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:59,500
They are not my children only my sperm was used.

1697
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:03,958
Did it because of that Dr. Chaddha and later...first it was for money

1698
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,625
 Sorry..

1699
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,625
 ..you did it for money.

1700
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:14,750
 Oh God.

1701
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:17,833
 Its disgusting Vicky.

1702
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,625
 Why didn't you tell me.

1703
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:26,666
Look now I made a mistake...now what do I do...

1704
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:31,708
I am not interested just tell me why didn't you tell me.

1705
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:36,208
 What would I have told you.

1706
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:37,833
 Did you do it after marriage also?

1707
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,583
Didn't go to the clinic but Dr. Chaddha's man...

1708
01:33:43,666 --> 01:33:45,833
...used to come home to collect the sample...

1709
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,500
 Move move...

1710
01:33:57,875 --> 01:33:59,000
Now, what's the point in sleeping separately.

1711
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:00,375
 Husband wife have such problems.

1712
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:03,416
And trust if that itself does not remain.

1713
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:06,500
 I can not sleep with you any more.

1714
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:08,916
I can not sleep with a man who shags for money.

1715
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,666
I feel so stupid...You kept doing all this ...

1716
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,166
 ...just didn't come to know.

1717
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,875
 Earlier I did it for money but later

1718
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:22,125
O.K. fine when you felt that you were doing it for social service...

1719
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,416
 ...then you could have told me...

1720
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:25,333
 ...may be I could have understood...

1721
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,250
And where are your children. I want to meet them... now.

1722
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,625
How you can just meet them...it's ... It's a contract.

1723
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:33,625
What contract...I am your wife. You're my husband...

1724
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:35,208
...they are your children and I can meet them.

1725
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:36,916
I want to meet them now. I don't know...

1726
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:38,916
 I don't care just now.

1727
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:44,791
 What are you searching for.

1728
01:34:45,333 --> 01:34:47,250
Boroline. - Why.

1729
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:49,958
 What's it to you...I want it.

1730
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:12,041
 Not going to the bank.

1731
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,750
 Move...

1732
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:23,791
 Ashima.

1733
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,041
 Ashima.

1734
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:47,833
 "The purity of water"

1735
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:54,833
 "The purity of water"

1736
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,791
Yes mummy. - Police is here..

1737
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,125
..they are saying that you have black money..

1738
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,375
 ...and they have come to take that.

1739
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,250
 This is only a beauty parlour...

1740
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:02,833
...or some other facility is also available.

1741
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:04,458
Excuse me, how're you speaking with the lady...

1742
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:06,333
Are you Vicky. - Mummy you go inside

1743
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:09,541
Just tell me where did all this come from.

1744
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:11,708
I have purchased it, don't people give gifts...

1745
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:14,291
It is gift. - Yes - These 25 lakhs is also a gift.

1746
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:16,375
Good thing the parcel went to the wrong address...

1747
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:18,708
To Pepsi Balla and she reported it to us.

1748
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:21,083
Listen. Where are you taking him... - Put him in the police van.

1749
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:22,916
I will come in sometime... just inform Ashima

1750
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:37,125
 "My beloved didn't show up"

1751
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:43,125
 "My beloved didn't show up"

1752
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:45,791
 I am sorry my dear.

1753
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,416
 My love didn't show up

1754
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,291
 "My beloved didn't show up"

1755
01:36:54,416 --> 01:37:04,791
 "When I saw your divine eyes"

1756
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:06,958
 Hey hero come outside.

1757
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:11,750
Now you tell me that when a person gets such good news after years...

1758
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:14,958
...who's become a father for the first time...

1759
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:17,625
...and if he happens to be a rich man...

1760
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:19,250
Wouldn't he like to share his happiness?

1761
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,708
...he'd like to give a gift...in cash or kind...

1762
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:25,041
...besides this one came from the minister's house...

1763
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:28,541
...now if I take his name then both of us will be in trouble...

1764
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:30,208
 Is there a business like this also?

1765
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:33,333
Yes ofcourse sir, and its legal. Sperm donation.

1766
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:35,333
Dr. Chaddha now I don't want to have anything..

1767
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,583
 ..to do with you seriously...

1768
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:38,041
 What happened.

1769
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,375
 It makes no difference to you...

1770
01:37:40,458 --> 01:37:41,916
...if the some one's life is destroyed does it.

1771
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,208
 Just tell me what happened

1772
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:45,375
 Sir Ashima can not be pregnant.

1773
01:37:47,083 --> 01:37:48,416
 We can not have a child.

1774
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:51,708
Me, a sperm donor, used to brag about it...

1775
01:37:51,791 --> 01:37:52,916
...and now I myself can't have a child...

1776
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,916
 Oh no. She has tubal blockage.

1777
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:01,375
 I am so sorry.

1778
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:03,000
 Forget this sorry sir...

1779
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:06,583
it's like this only now, life has taken my case.

1780
01:38:07,166 --> 01:38:09,083
 Just listen...

1781
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:19,000
 Where is Ashima?

1782
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:28,041
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself doing this dirty business?

1783
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:31,875
The inspector suspected me of running a brothel...

1784
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:36,125
 You have ruined our family's name...

1785
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:40,125
 ...and you ask me where Ashima is...

1786
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:43,375
 She has left for Calcutta...

1787
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:45,875
...and if I was in her place, I would have done the same.

1788
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:49,041
 Now get lost from here.

1789
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:55,708
 "The purity of water''

1790
01:38:56,125 --> 01:39:01,666
 "The purity of water"

1791
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:06,833
Tuna have you fought with him and come here.

1792
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:08,208
 No dad.

1793
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,083
 Then what's wrong.

1794
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:12,333
 Nothing.

1795
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:18,500
Vicky you have really insulted us and your Dr. Chaddha...

1796
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:21,333
...bloody villain, I'll catch him soon...

1797
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:24,916
 Sperm donor ohm...

1798
01:39:25,041 --> 01:39:26,875
 so what's the problem.

1799
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:28,375
 What are you saying dad?

1800
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,166
 How can you support him?

1801
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:33,208
Darling you are a modern woman, well read...

1802
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:35,541
...well traveled and you are talking like this rubbish.

1803
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:38,416
 Rubbish...your calling it rubbish...

1804
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:40,791
Your son-in-law already has children...

1805
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:42,791
...and you expect me to have a modern outlook?

1806
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:45,000
 He should have told me...

1807
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:50,125
 My beloved didn't show up

1808
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:52,875
These are today's so called modern women

1809
01:39:53,541 --> 01:39:56,625
...shameless - who can give birth to a child with anybody...

1810
01:39:57,666 --> 01:40:02,458
Grand mom you call yourself modern. Are modern people like this.

1811
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:07,750
Atleast I understood one thing. - bread also got burnt.

1812
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:11,916
Those who couldn't have kids, have kids today because of Vicky

1813
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,541
 Mom it's all science.

1814
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:19,583
Listen...to hell with your science and arts...

1815
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:23,416
...because of this our entire family's name is ruined...

1816
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:25,166
 This is science...

1817
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:30,000
 "Memories"

1818
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:33,083
 "Your memories"

1819
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:36,625
 Your thoughts

1820
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,541
 Smolder my life

1821
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:44,250
 Nights

1822
01:40:44,666 --> 01:40:47,541
 Dark, lonesome nights

1823
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:56,250
 Frighten me, hound me

1824
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:59,000
 My love,

1825
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:02,083

1826
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:05,625
Dolly let it be, am not in a good mood today

1827
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:08,916

1830
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:18,041

1831
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:19,541
 Dolly aunty and Ashima didn't come?

1832
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,458
No they didn't come. - Congratulations.

1833
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:24,041
 They haunt

1834
01:41:24,708 --> 01:41:30,041
 And tear me apart

1835
01:41:30,958 --> 01:41:34,083
 Your promises

1836
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:38,958
 Your thoughts

1837
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,333
 My love,

1838
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:45,208
 without you I shall die

1839
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:47,416
 My love,

1840
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:51,458
 without you I shall die

1841
01:41:52,708 --> 01:41:56,791
Oye Vicky I heard that Ashima has left...

1842
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:58,916

1843
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,083
 You didn't even call...

1844
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:02,458
 where are you going.

1845
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:06,375
To donate sperm. You want to come along?

1846
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:09,625
 If not for me..

1847
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:13,041
 Atleast for yourself..

1848
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:16,000
Vicky dear at my shop, look, this is the ladies section...

1849
01:42:16,041 --> 01:42:17,208
 ...and that is gents section.

1850
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:19,291
Poppy write the bills... - Yes, father.

1851
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:25,166
Vicky Dolly had called me, told me that you've done something wrong..

1852
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:27,083
...really you've done something very inappropriate...

1853
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:29,166
 What wrong...what wrong have I done.

1854
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:32,000
Uncle I was a sperm donor. Is sperm donation wrong work.

1855
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:33,416
 If it is yes then what you will do.

1856
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,666
You will stop me from coming in the shop.

1857
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:36,125
 Go to hell with your shop.

1858
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:37,625
What have you done all your whole life..

1859
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:39,416
 ..except giving birth to this Poppy.

1860
01:42:39,583 --> 01:42:40,958
 If you were a sperm donor like me...

1861
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:44,250
...then could have had a chance of giving birth to better samples.

1862
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:46,958
 "My love,"

1863
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:50,791

1864
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:52,916
 My love,

01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,833
 without you I shall die

1866
01:42:58,708 --> 01:43:01,416
 My love,

1867
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:04,625

1869
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,583

01:43:38,333 --> 01:43:39,416
 How are you?

1878
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,125
 "Your thoughts.."

1879
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:44,875
let it be...how I could be without you...

1880
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:49,000
 Nights

1881
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:52,250
 Dark, lonesome nights

1882
01:43:53,041 --> 01:44:01,083
 Frighten me, hound me

1883
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:03,708
 "My love,"

1884
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:06,583
 "without you I shall die"

1885
01:44:06,666 --> 01:44:07,791
 Hello Vicky

1886
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:09,833
 How you dare to call here.

1887
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:12,500
You got only my son in the entire world for this.

1888
01:44:12,583 --> 01:44:14,791
No - See I also know to do business...

1889
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,958
...but I never play with the emotions of people.

1890
01:44:17,041 --> 01:44:18,666
 See you are misunderstanding me.

1891
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,333
We have trusted on you and you have used us.

1892
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,750
You have made our house into pieces, made partition of it.

1893
01:44:24,833 --> 01:44:27,125
 What type of doctor are you?

1894
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:28,750
Let it be now. - Leave me.

1895
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:31,625
Shut up and see I am giving you warning that...

1896
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,958
 ...if you came in front of my eyes...

1897
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:38,125
...and if you tried to meet or contact to me or Vicky...

1898
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:40,916
...in future then I will cut you into pieces.

1899
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,375
 Meet me once, please.

1900
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:54,666
 Please Dr. Chaddha it's Ok

1901
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:57,250
 It makes no difference.

1902
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,958
All these things happened and you did not tell me anything.

1903
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:09,333
Sir the reality is that you have taken his advantage...

1904
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:13,541
...you have purchased car, farm house and house.

1905
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:18,833
First it is important to take out Vicky from this situation...

1906
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:24,333
...otherwise the acidity which is in me will never be healed up.

1907
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:28,000
Dolly is the first lady who read me correctly.

1908
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:32,500
It is called grip on life... that she has.

1909
01:45:33,791 --> 01:45:39,708
She was shouting in anger on phone but there was pain in the voice.

1910
01:45:40,916 --> 01:45:43,750
Great lady. - Sir I understand Dolly ma'am...

1911
01:45:44,958 --> 01:45:47,708
...but now what to do further that we have must think.

1912
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:51,666
 Oh, God.

1913
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:55,958
 So, what you are thinking sir.

1914
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,958
I don't understand how it will happen so soon.

1915
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:02,125
 You don't give me tension.

1916
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:05,166
 Sir you don't take tension and go.

1917
01:46:05,666 --> 01:46:08,208
 Just leave that key and lap top here.

1918
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,625
 Chaman!

1919
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:50,750
 Chaman..

1920
01:46:52,291 --> 01:46:53,375
 ..what is going on.

1921
01:46:53,458 --> 01:46:54,583
 Sir good morning sir

1922
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:55,875
 Good morning.

1923
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,041
 Sir

1924
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:00,500
 What is this.

1925
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:03,500
Sir this is the file of Vicky Donor and all the details are in this.

1926
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:06,416
 Oh you are very unpredictable sperm.

1927
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,875
Sir you don't think now and take the name of God...

1928
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:10,750
 ...and dial the first number.

1929
01:47:10,916 --> 01:47:12,291
 You are right.

1930
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,500
 Hello yes... Mr. Bhatia speaking?.

1931
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:23,250
Mr. Bhatia greetings,. Dr. Baldev from Chaddha Infertility clinic...

1932
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:29,625
O.K. ma'am... Ahuja with Mrs. Ahuja next Saturday 25th Anniversary.

1933
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:31,500
 Am I talking to Mrs. Grewal.

1934
01:47:31,583 --> 01:47:33,000
 Hello, Dr. Chaddha.

1935
01:47:33,125 --> 01:47:36,000
 Oh my God you recognized my voice.

1936
01:47:36,041 --> 01:47:40,333
You know what my in-laws say that he is a ghost of Ambani.

1937
01:47:43,083 --> 01:47:47,041
Yes I have sent silver anniversary card by courier.

1938
01:47:47,083 --> 01:47:49,875
But it was my duty to invite you personally.

1939
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:51,666
 Mrs. Mehta has done another one!

1940
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:53,208
 I am so sorry Mr. Mehta...

1941
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:55,166
...by the way Mr. Mehta can you give the number...

1942
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:56,875
 ...of new husband of Mrs. Mehta.

1943
01:47:59,083 --> 01:48:02,208
He cut it. - Can I talk to Mrs. Mirchandani please.

1944
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:04,458
 Next baby, cooler sperm...

1945
01:48:05,666 --> 01:48:07,000
 After two building.

1946
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,458
Madam is not there... he is in the bedroom with someone else.

1947
01:48:17,666 --> 01:48:20,416
 Yes Mr. Lee Silver Jubilee

1948
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:23,875
Kapoor or this is just a gentle reminder. - Congratulations.

1949
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:25,041
 We will definitely come.

1950
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:27,041
 Tuna so what's your plan.

1951
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,500
Bank wants to know when you are joining back.

1952
01:48:29,791 --> 01:48:33,083
I don't know. - What you are doing is not good for you Tuna.

1953
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:36,083
Whatever is in your heart you must discuss with Vicky..

1954
01:48:36,166 --> 01:48:37,500
 ..it is necessary.

1955
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:40,041
 Did he feel necessary to tell me?

1956
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:43,083
 I don't know

1957
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:46,166
 You are so shameless!

1958
01:48:47,291 --> 01:48:48,666
 Always keep coming here!

1959
01:48:49,125 --> 01:48:50,708
 Every one commits a mistake.

1960
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:52,333
 You forget the past.

1961
01:48:52,416 --> 01:48:54,500
 Again you are back on the same topic.

1962
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,458
 Don't say topic...

1963
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:58,583
 ...since the last two months four...

1964
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:00,125
...cases have been lodged by clients against me.

1965
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:04,333
You ask why because their children have not even learnt to say...

1966
01:49:04,416 --> 01:49:09,000
...mummy papa and they have started to abuse.

1967
01:49:09,541 --> 01:49:13,500
The party says that the family back ground of the donor was not good.

1968
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:17,416
 Shake hands at least!

1969
01:49:17,875 --> 01:49:20,500
Well tried Chaddha sir, please get out.

1970
01:49:21,166 --> 01:49:22,291
 Please.

1971
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:28,958
See I can understand your frustration but I realized.

1972
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:30,791
How can you understand the frustration?

1973
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:34,541
This house is not a house without Ashima.

1974
01:49:35,666 --> 01:49:37,041
 The silence is haunting...

1975
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:42,666
One iron lady your mother told me correctly...

1976
01:49:43,958 --> 01:49:46,541
...that I have spoiled your family life.

1977
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:49,708
 I did it. I have to correct it now.

1978
01:49:50,416 --> 01:49:53,000
Dolly says that Ashima should come back home.

1979
01:49:53,083 --> 01:49:55,208
I also think that Ashima should come back.

1980
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:58,375
Ashima has to understand that you were not wrong.

1981
01:49:58,458 --> 01:49:59,708
 This is not possible.

1982
01:49:59,916 --> 01:50:05,000
Once you bring her to my clinic for one hour on next Saturday.

1983
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:08,166
Next Saturday is the 25th anniversary of the clinic.

1984
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:11,541
See this, 25th silver jubilee anniversary.

1985
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:18,791
Do you think that she will come? - She will surely come.

1986
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:22,083
 I told you I need some more time.

1987
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:25,125
 I can not come now.

1988
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:30,750
Just see, it is only a matter of one day.

1989
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:35,750
Even after that if you feel that what I did was wrong then...

1990
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:39,125
 ...we will sort out according to you.

1991
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:44,291
 You want separation or divorce?

1992
01:50:44,375 --> 01:50:45,458
 Divorce?

1993
01:50:46,708 --> 01:50:52,750
Did I hear divorce...no no. not again you will go with him.

1994
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:54,583
 Dad you are again taking his side.

1995
01:50:54,666 --> 01:50:56,375
 Yes I am...

1996
01:50:57,791 --> 01:51:00,125
...because you are only thinking about yourself.

1997
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:03,666
But she is right papa, meaning I have not told her. It is my mistake.

1998
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:05,000
 Question yourself Tuna.

1999
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:10,875
You are hurt because he was donor or he has not informed you or...

2000
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:14,833
...you can not get pregnant while he can become a father.

2001
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:22,083
 He loves you...

2002
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:25,666
 ...even after knowing that..

2003
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:27,875
..because of you he can not give birth to a child.

2004
01:51:29,666 --> 01:51:34,083
..he wants to be with you...it's not that easy darling.

2005
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,833
 For once, just think from his side.

2006
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:40,000
 It's ok.

2007
01:51:42,333 --> 01:51:45,291
If you don't want to come then don't come.

2008
01:51:46,458 --> 01:51:47,583
 Why are you crying?

2009
01:51:49,166 --> 01:51:52,208
See I have come to your city Kolkata for the second time.

2010
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:55,750
 Show me your city.

2011
01:51:58,125 --> 01:51:59,333
 Show me Kaalibadi...

2012
01:52:01,291 --> 01:52:04,041
 ...a match of Mohan Bagan...

2013
01:52:06,875 --> 01:52:08,291
 Make me meet Mamata didi..

2014
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,583
 But don't cry.

2015
01:52:36,958 --> 01:52:38,333
 Welcome.

2016
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:41,250
 Come, come.

2017
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,625
Grace of God, welcome...come... please come. Have a look.

2018
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:49,041
 Ashima.

2019
01:52:54,583 --> 01:52:56,458
 Whatever Vicky has done..

2020
01:52:57,708 --> 01:53:02,083
..or I got it done from him was right or wrong ...

2021
01:53:02,375 --> 01:53:04,041
 I really don't know...

2022
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:10,958
Call me a businessman or a doctor or my helplessness...

2023
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:14,500
Nor do I wish to give any explanation...

2024
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:17,916
But I would like to ask you one question.

2025
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:25,333
Just stand here and tell me how you are feeling to see...

2026
01:53:25,416 --> 01:53:27,375
 ...these kids playing in the park.

2027
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:32,666
What kind of a question is this? All I know is among these...

2028
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:36,250
...kids even my child could have been there.

2029
01:53:38,166 --> 01:53:42,000
 All are happy, enjoying.

2030
01:53:42,833 --> 01:53:44,916
 Everyone's family is complete but...

2031
01:53:46,416 --> 01:53:47,791
 ...why not mine.

2032
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,708
 Just like you are feeling now...

2033
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:55,000
..few years back parents of these children..

2034
01:53:55,083 --> 01:53:57,250
 ..were also feeling the same.

2035
01:53:58,041 --> 01:54:01,000
Before Vicky donor came into their life.

2036
01:54:01,916 --> 01:54:06,125
The reason for their happiness is Vicky.

2037
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:11,125
Because these children are from his sperm.

2038
01:54:16,458 --> 01:54:19,208
 Come with me. Look, look.

2039
01:54:32,041 --> 01:54:35,250
 Which among them are mine?

2040
01:54:36,666 --> 01:54:39,250
 Each & everyone is yours...

2041
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:43,458
All of them are mine? - 53

2042
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:45,333
 53

2043
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:47,333
 Total 53

2044
01:54:49,666 --> 01:54:50,875
 Vicky..

2045
01:54:54,208 --> 01:54:55,666
Can I meet them? - Sure.

2046
01:54:55,916 --> 01:54:58,416
 Yes but don't ask for details.

2047
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:15,083
"When this little flower bud blooms into a plant"

2048
01:55:16,083 --> 01:55:20,166
 "Bud blooms into a plant"

2049
01:55:21,708 --> 01:55:28,750
 The pot of wants blooms with it

2050
01:55:29,833 --> 01:55:31,958
 The pot of wants blooms with it

2051
01:55:32,041 --> 01:55:35,458
 And so does the demand for this...

2052
01:55:35,541 --> 01:55:38,750
...that and just about everything that money can buy. - Aishwarya..

2053
01:55:39,041 --> 01:55:45,875
As the wants are unlimited and even bigger than the sky

2054
01:55:48,583 --> 01:55:51,000
 Hello.

2055
01:55:53,166 --> 01:55:55,541
 Here, here's you gift.

2056
01:55:58,958 --> 01:56:02,375
 The world is with me.

2057
01:56:03,041 --> 01:56:09,750
 When a bud turns into a tree

2058
01:56:09,833 --> 01:56:11,041
 Enjoy yourself.

2059
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:13,750
 When a bud turns into a tree

2060
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:17,416
 He is quiet fit.

2061
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:25,291
 You get the urge to live

2062
01:56:25,791 --> 01:56:27,000
 Sit down, sit down.

2063
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:30,208
 And so does the demand for this...

2064
01:56:30,291 --> 01:56:33,541
...that and just about everything that money can buy

2065
01:56:33,875 --> 01:56:40,708
As the wants are unlimited and even bigger than the sky

2066
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:42,666
 Closer.

2067
01:56:46,375 --> 01:56:49,083
 That boy there in black...

2068
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:54,000
 ...his hair is like yours...

2069
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:58,625
 That little foreigner girl's...

2070
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:02,666
 ...nose is like yours...

2071
01:57:05,916 --> 01:57:08,291
 ...that little ching chong...

2072
01:57:11,166 --> 01:57:12,791
 ...his eyes are like yours.

2073
01:57:14,666 --> 01:57:18,458
 Baba was right and I was insecure.

2074
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:23,708
 I can not do the same which you did..

2075
01:57:25,958 --> 01:57:27,250
 ..never...

2076
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:29,875
 I am sorry.

2077
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:31,750
 I am sorry.

2078
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:35,750
 I am sorry.

2079
01:57:59,583 --> 01:58:01,000
 There is one more child...

2080
01:58:03,416 --> 01:58:05,416
 ...and I want you to meet with him.

2081
01:58:08,625 --> 01:58:10,166
 Myself and Chaman were inviting the...

2082
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:13,625
...clients by going door to door for the anniversary.

2083
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:16,500
I came to know that one couple among them...

2084
01:58:16,583 --> 01:58:20,333
...died in a car accident near Chandigarh few years back.

2085
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,625
After death of the son they came to know...

2086
01:58:22,708 --> 01:58:25,208
...that their grand daughter is a donor baby.

2087
01:58:25,416 --> 01:58:29,125
They tried hard to find out but could not succeed.

2088
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:30,500
 Due to the old age..

2089
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:32,166
..and since there was no one after them to take care...

2090
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:35,458
...they put her in this orphanage house.

2091
01:58:35,541 --> 01:58:38,500
Thank you Dr. Chaddha for doing this, you saved a soul...

2092
01:58:39,333 --> 01:58:42,583
...and Mr. and Mrs. Arora the name of the child is Diya...

2093
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:45,250
...and she's been here with us for last six months...

2094
01:58:46,208 --> 01:58:47,333
 Shall we go and meet her.

2095
01:58:47,416 --> 01:58:48,500
 Sure..

2096
01:59:34,875 --> 01:59:36,041
 Let's go home.

2097
01:59:45,916 --> 01:59:47,000
 Thank you ma'am

2098
01:59:47,375 --> 01:59:49,291
I am sure you are going to keep Diya happy.

2099
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,166
 Thanks ma'am.

2100
01:59:51,708 --> 01:59:53,166
Thank you very much. - Thank you.

2101
01:59:53,541 --> 01:59:55,250
 Come. Come.

2102
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:02,291
 Thank you.

2103
02:00:02,833 --> 02:00:04,000
 God bless.

2104
02:00:13,958 --> 02:00:17,250
 You did all this for me.

2105
02:00:18,666 --> 02:00:20,083
 Chaddha sir you are unbelievable...

2106
02:00:22,333 --> 02:00:24,416
What did I do? I have not done anything.

2107
02:00:26,708 --> 02:00:28,791
You did all this and this is your wonder.

2108
02:00:29,416 --> 02:00:33,125
 The wonder of your sperm

2109
02:00:35,416 --> 02:00:37,666
 This entire world is a sperm.

2110
02:00:46,083 --> 02:00:47,500
 God bless you.

2111
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:48,833
 Bye.

2112
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:16,708
Chaddha sir... - Listen there is a demand from one more party.

2113
02:01:16,916 --> 02:01:19,333
What are you talking? I am a family man now.

2114
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:21,250
 Just do it for the last time.

2115
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:22,791
 Shall I say yes?

2116
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:25,083
I will get it picked up from any where you say.

2117
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:30,541
Ok. - Ok. Bye!!!

2118
02:01:41,041 --> 02:01:44,250
"Rum, rum, rum - Whiskey"

2119
02:01:45,666 --> 02:01:47,375
"Rum, rum, rum - Whiskey"

2120
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:51,333

 "Weigh it in your heart and see."

2125
02:02:05,125 --> 02:02:09,791
"You will not find a young man like me."

2126
02:02:10,166 --> 02:02:13,625
 "You may search in the whole world."

2127
02:02:13,708 --> 02:02:18,750
 "Search, search. Search, search."

2128
02:02:18,833 --> 02:02:21,916
"You people go for the door. I want to be on the floor."

2129
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:25,583
 "Mix it with our colours."

2130
02:02:25,833 --> 02:02:29,041
 "Go over it with red flowers."

2131
02:02:29,125 --> 02:02:33,791

"Rum, rum, rum - Whiskey"

2137
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:57,958
"Rum, rum, rum - Whiskey"

2138
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:06,750
 "For the sake of love."

2139
02:03:06,833 --> 02:03:12,041
 "Will open my heart before you."

2140
02:03:13,625 --> 02:03:18,625

 "My shoes are sequenced."

2145
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:44,541
"The moustache is starched, and the turban is colourful."

2146
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:49,125
"You will not find a young man like me."

2147
02:03:49,583 --> 02:03:53,000
