1
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,860
Nuts?

2
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,690
Nuts?

3
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,860
Nuts?

4
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,610
-I must be.
-Nuts?

5
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,820
Yes?

6
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,070
Naina Sethi?

7
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,810
Yeah. Yes.

8
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,730
Badal Gupta.

9
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,890
Your lawyer, Jimmy Punjabi
has sent me here.

10
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,820
Oh!

11
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,530
Actually, I was expecting
you a little later.

12
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,220
-So, should I come back a little later?
-No. No...

13
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,890
-Please come in.
-Thank you.

14
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,570
Jimmy praises you a lot.

15
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,070
Good! Else I would have
had to praise myself.

16
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,690
-May I take your coat?
-No, I'll do it.

17
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,520
-Can I get you some tea, coffee?
-No, I am good. Thank you.

18
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh, please finish your meal.
I can wait.

19
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,110
No, I am done.

20
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,890
I don't feel like eating anyway.

21
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,680
My wife says,
a car cannot run without fuel.

22
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,270
-She must be really looking after you...
-Yes. A little too much.

23
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,310
Please have a seat,
I'll join you in a minute.

24
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,610
In other news, the trial of
Naina Sethi is set to begin this week.

25
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,820
Photographer Arjun Joseph,
found dead in a hotel room

26
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,440
was allegedly murdered by
his lover, Naina Sethi.

27
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,220
Sethi, was recently awarded the
Focus Business Person of the Year Award

28
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,810
is pleading innocent and states
she was the victim of a plot.

29
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,110
Sethi, currently out on bail
will be appearing in court this--

30
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,390
Please sit.

31
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,650
At least they said "allegedly."
I'll sit here?

32
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,930
Right now, you're just a suspect.

33
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,640
There is no evidence against you.

34
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,980
There won't be any.

35
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,440
Because I haven't done anything.

36
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,530
But sometimes you get punished
for doing nothing.

37
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,780
-How?
-Homework.

38
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,820
In school? You get punished
for not doing your homework.

39
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,390
Seriously?

40
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,220
Sorry. That was a bad joke.

41
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,110
But, it's very popular amongst us lawyers.

42
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,570
-Good to know.
-But, on a more serious note...

43
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,310
we may have a problem.

44
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,350
Do you know where's Jimmy?
I can't reach his phone.

45
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,220
He's out of town.

46
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,970
But Jimmy said that
everything is under control.

47
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,610
-He's found a lead that will--
-That will...

48
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,780
change the case in our favor?

49
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,430
-Yes.
-He said the same to me,

50
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,850
when we last spoke.

51
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,110
However...

52
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,720
what I just found out...
can also change our case.

53
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,430
But...

54
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,220
not in our favor.

55
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,530
The prosecution has found a
new witness against you--

56
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,430
Who?

57
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,860
I don't know.

58
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,850
I don't know who or what.

59
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,940
But that person has some evidence...

60
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,900
which can completely change our case.

61
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,470
That's why I changed my time to come here.

62
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,360
The new witness will testify...

63
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,970
at the police station in three hours.

64
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,020
And if the witness does
have any evidence...

65
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,310
then I am afraid, you may be
called to the police station tonight.

66
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,820
-And...
-And?

67
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,070
The police may issue an
arrest warrant for you.

68
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,180
Let me just call Jimmy.

69
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,180
You have reached the voice mail box of...

70
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,310
His phone's off.

71
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,360
Whatever evidence this witness has...
how will it change our case?

72
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,480
I've told the truth to the court.

73
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,270
What we think is the truth,
might not be the truth for everyone.

74
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,190
Everyone sees truth
differently, Ms. Sethi.

75
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,020
As you're aware justice is blind.

76
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,610
It only considers that truth...

77
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,810
which can be proven.

78
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,780
Which can be believed in.

79
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,810
And belief, Ms. Sethi...

80
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,020
is built from, the details.

81
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,400
Details that...

82
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,570
make or break the evidence.

83
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,110
As you said, they may have evidence,
but you have the truth.

84
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,820
And I need this truth.

85
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,390
Because your statement
has some loopholes in it.

86
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,360
Which the prosecution might
use against you...

87
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,820
that's why I need the truth
to seal these loopholes.

88
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,350
And I assure you, I can do it.

89
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,020
I've never lost a case till date.

90
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,280
That's why your lawyer hired me.

91
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,780
But you know,
Ms. Sethi, I'll need the truth.

92
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,430
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

93
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,320
So help me God.

94
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,470
I made one mistake...

95
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,310
and ended up in such a mess.

96
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,600
My husband and child have left me.

97
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,610
The police have turned
my house into prison.

98
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,820
I am being watched 24 hours.

99
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,530
Don't you think, if I had anything
else to say, I would've said it by now?

100
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,530
Then we have nothing to discuss.

101
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,780
A murder was committed and the
police found the murderer.

102
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,070
-Who?
-You.

103
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,850
Didn't you just see the news?

104
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,860
Naina...
Sorry, may I call you by your name?

105
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,180
Thank you.
I have a daughter of your age.

106
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,680
Naina, if the prosecution had its way,
you'd be arrested at the earliest.

107
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,310
We have only three hours to stop them.

108
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,230
And I can stop them,
provided you tell me the truth.

109
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,570
Again? I told you already!

110
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,520
I am telling the truth!

111
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,650
-Someone's trying to frame me.
-You're paying me by the hour, Naina.

112
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,070
Either you continue to
whine about being framed...

113
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,350
or with my help,
keep yourself out of jail.

114
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
The choice is yours.

115
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,030
-Fine!
-Good.

116
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
That's the spirit.

117
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,110
Okay, let's start from the beginning.

118
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,730
What were you and Arjun
doing at the Glen Mohr Hotel?

119
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,110
We were told to go there.

120
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,930
Arjun and I had been
together for three months.

121
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,230
Someone found out and
started blackmailing us.

122
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,820
We were only following instructions.

123
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,470
-Blackmailer wanted 100,000 pounds.
-100,000 pounds!

124
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,280
That's a lot of money.

125
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,270
Was it just an affair with Arjun
or were you in love with him?

126
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,280
I love only my husband and my child.
That's all.

127
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,390
Arjun was a mistake, nothing else.

128
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,690
The hotel is...

129
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,860
200 miles from here.

130
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,650
I told you already,
I didn't choose the hotel.

131
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,100
Didn't you find it odd...

132
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,480
-a place so far away--
-How should I know?

133
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,390
The blackmailer could be fond of their
room service or the d'cor... I don't know.

134
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,650
But seriously,
why this hotel in particular?

135
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,030
Had you two been there before?

136
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,140
How does it matter?

137
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,690
Don't you think it's
more important that...

138
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,930
somebody committed a murder at that hotel
and pinned it on me?

139
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,850
Naina, everything is important.
Everything!

140
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,140
Remember, details.

141
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,890
Whatever it is that you saw...

142
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,360
you must make me see.

143
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,730
Like how it was...

144
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,810
for Sanjay and Dhritarashtra.

145
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,400
-Who?
-Sanjay and Dhritarashtra.

146
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,640
You must have read the Mahabharata.

147
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,020
When I was young.
I know the basic story line.

148
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,430
"Basic story line!"
That's a good one.

149
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,070
No, but...
Naina, listen.

150
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,680
Like justice,
Dhritarashtra was also blind.

151
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,350
And Sanjay was his eyes.

152
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,100
Whatever Sanjay told him...

153
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,390
became the truth for him.

154
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,020
Now, you are my eyes.

155
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,890
Whatever you tell me,
will become the truth for me.

156
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,400
So, try to see everything
clearly in your mind...

157
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,270
and then tell me.

158
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,440
Every little detail.

159
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,360
Okay?
So, first off...

160
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,650
you told the police that you
received an SMS. Tell me about it.

161
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,320
We had been waiting there for two hours.

162
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,780
-Arjun?
-What happened?

163
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,600
Blackmailer has sent a
text from your phone.

164
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,440
Saying, "I'll tell everyone the truth."

165
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,060
It is a trap.

166
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,690
Grab your coat, I'll take the money.
Let's get out of here.

167
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,280
I was unconscious for a while.

168
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,280
-When I woke up...
-What did you first see?

169
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,850
Someone was knocking on the door.

170
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,360
Police! Can you hear me?
Is everything okay?

171
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,030
Open the door, now!

172
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,570
Can you hear me?

173
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,560
Is everything okay in there?

174
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,230
Arjun! What's wrong, Arjun?

175
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,390
Hey, you.
Open the door.

176
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,640
Step aside.

177
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,810
Can someone help me?

178
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,280
Help!
Can someone help? Arjun!

179
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,430
Wake up, Arjun!

180
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,020
-Police!
-Can someone help me, please?

181
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,390
-Get up slowly.
-Can you please help me?

182
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,940
Hands where I can see them.

183
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,600
-Hands where I can see them.
-There's someone else in the room!

184
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,360
Hands behind your back. Now!

185
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,280
I didn't do anything.
There's someone else in the room.

186
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,430
Stay where you are.

187
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,440
Can't you hear me?
There's someone else in the room!

188
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,770
-I haven't done anything!
-Listen to me!

189
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,610
Turn around!
Turn around, now!

190
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,900
Stay where you are and
turn around, please.

191
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,070
He must not have gone too far.
Officer, please!

192
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,230
Officer, there's someone else--

193
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,140
I am arresting you under
suspicion of murder.

194
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,480
-I haven't done anything--
-You do not have to say anything,

195
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,060
but if you do say anything,
it may be used in the courts of law

196
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,650
as an evidence against you.

197
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,140
Send forensics.
We have a dead body.

198
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,610
According to the police report...

199
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,270
the witnesses heard someone
scream in the room, but...

200
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,970
did not see anybody leave.

201
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,280
The door was locked
and chained from inside.

202
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,350
The windows could not be opened
because the hotel,

203
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,360
removes the window handles during winter.

204
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,890
And, there was no sign of force
on the doors or windows.

205
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,480
No footprints either.

206
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,600
The police investigated all
exit points in the room.

207
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,030
But it was impossible to leave
that room without a trace.

208
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,940
So, according to your statement...

209
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,270
whoever killed Arjun...

210
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,690
just disappeared into thin air.

211
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,070
Yes.

212
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,150
But the person must have entered the
room before disappearing, right?

213
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,150
Someone was already in the
room before we got there.

214
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,150
How?

215
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,060
The hotel staff testified that
only you had the key to the room.

216
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,220
So, how?

217
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,390
That's exactly
what I am saying, Mr. Gupta.

218
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,570
The whole thing was
planned very carefully.

219
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,470
The entire crime scene
was planned to frame me.

220
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,480
So the police would think that
I wanted to break up with Arjun

221
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,270
and I offered him money to
keep our affair a secret.

222
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,930
But when he refused, I killed him.

223
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,720
-Who would want to frame you?
-I don't know.

224
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,280
-Don't you suspect anybody?
-I don't know!

225
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,140
All I know, is that my husband
and child have left me.

226
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm getting stuck with this mess,
while the culprit is getting away.

227
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,320
To frame somebody...

228
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,810
one needs a motive.

229
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,110
Why would anybody do this to you?
What's the motive?

230
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,640
Your story has
neither a motive, nor a murderer.

231
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,610
So, where are we?

232
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,440
It's not my job to arrest the murderer.

233
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,900
-It's the police's job.
-And they have done it. You!

234
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,230
Naina, forget about the judge,

235
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,350
even I cannot believe...

236
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,140
-this invisible murderer story.
-That's your problem.

237
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,430
But this is the truth.

238
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,820
You know, Naina,
in my 40 years of experience,

239
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,690
I've come across two kinds of clients.

240
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,140
One, who think they are smarter than
me and the other, who are actually smart.

241
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,780
You seem like the first kind.

242
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,320
So, let me be very clear.

243
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,570
Neither are you smarter than me

244
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,480
nor should you try to be.

245
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,570
No, no...
Just one minute.

246
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,530
Look, this is the missing boy.

247
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,100
And the headline says,
"Missing from Aviemore."

248
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,940
What do you think?

249
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,820
Isn't Aviemore near Glen Mohr Hotel?

250
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,570
What do you think will happen...

251
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,530
if the new witness connects
this story with your case?

252
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,430
You know, Naina...

253
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,020
we have wasted ten minutes.

254
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,860
And you are still the murderer.

255
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,650
So, if you want me to find the truth
and keep you out of jail,

256
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,070
tell me everything,
even if it seems irrelevant.

257
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,650
And I implore you,
do not hide anything from me!

258
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,520
Don't try to hide anything
from me, from now! Okay?

259
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,430
Right.

260
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,720
It all began three months ago.

261
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,810
-And I still regret--
-Woah!

262
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,230
Woah! Naina!

263
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,690
This room walls, the furniture, me...

264
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,100
we all understand that you
regret the whole thing.

265
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,930
But one does not win a murder
case by regretting.

266
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,280
To win a case, you need facts, details.

267
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,770
So, keeping the regret aside...

268
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,560
can we focus on the details? Yes?

269
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,320
Thank you.

270
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,480
Hi. How's Paris?

271
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,690
Very boring.

272
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,690
And how was the meeting?

273
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,970
Not good.

274
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,730
The deal didn't close.

275
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,430
Alright. Don't stress about it.

276
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Dad called. He has invited
us for lunch on Sunday.

277
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,100
What was that?

278
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,640
What was what?

279
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,690
-Are you smoking?
-No.

280
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,180
-Are you lying?
-No.

281
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,860
-Where's Sana?
-Right here. Talk to her.

282
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,930
Say hi to Momma.

283
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,100
-Hello, darling.
-Hello.

284
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,850
-Missing Mummy?
-Momma.

285
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,310
I'll be back today.

286
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,480
Love you.

287
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,940
When is your flight?

288
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,720
I am on my way to the airport.

289
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,690
Have a safe flight and I'll see you soon.

290
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,680
Love you.

291
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,400
Love you too.

292
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,440
Morning.

293
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,970
Morning.

294
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,470
Who was it?

295
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,820
Sunil.

296
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,940
What's the time?

297
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,770
We're late. Let's go.

298
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,780
Yes, sir.

299
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,220
-Mummy's call.
-Momma's call.

300
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,100
Mummy...

301
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,610
Wait, turn left.

302
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,140
But the GPS is showing right.

303
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,280
Yeah, but left is a shortcut.

304
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,900
-You're sure, right?
-Trust me, Naina.

305
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,820
We're already late.
I need to be home tonight.

306
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,570
It's empty roads now.
You can drive faster.

307
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,780
Are you okay?

308
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,350
I cannot do this anymore.

309
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,360
I can't keep lying to my family.
I am sorry.

310
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,350
Naina, I feel bad about lying, too.

311
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,190
But I love it when we're together.
The feeling is irreplaceable.

312
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,280
Do you remember what we had
decided when we started this?

313
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,430
That we both wanted to?

314
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,390
Also, that if we can't do
this anymore, we'll...

315
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,930
Do you want to leave Sunil?

316
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,730
No.

317
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,350
I don't want to leave Rachael either.

318
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,900
That's why, what we have is perfect.

319
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,810
This is wrong and you know it.

320
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,730
Naina, you want to leave me?

321
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,730
Yes.

322
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,770
Are you okay?

323
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,930
I don't know.

324
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,820
Shit!

325
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,980
Hey!

326
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,030
Hey...

327
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,470
-Hey, who are you calling?
-The police.

328
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,350
Police! Give me the phone.

329
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,110
-I have to report the accident.
-It wasn't our fault, Naina.

330
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,940
-There was a deer in our path.
-But I drove into his lane.

331
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,890
-Accidentally. Come here.
-Give me my phone back.

332
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,030
I need to call the police!

333
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,720
-Give me my phone back.
-He didn't even have his seat belt on.

334
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,430
Plus, he was on the phone.

335
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,980
If anyone was at fault, it was him.

336
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,650
Give me my phone back.

337
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,360
I could have controlled the car
but you made me drive faster.

338
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,070
-Naina, think--
-I have to call the police right now!

339
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,530
-I am calling the police.
-Naina, think!

340
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,560
-No! No--
-Naina, he's dead!

341
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,230
Do you understand that?

342
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,430
There's nothing you can do.

343
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,530
Listen to me...
Just, listen to me.

344
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,930
There's nobody else here.

345
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,930
Nobody saw anything.

346
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,350
We are the only ones who
know about this accident.

347
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,600
If you call the police...

348
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,650
everything that's been perfect till now.

349
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,060
Our families...

350
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,690
our careers...
everything will be destroyed.

351
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,350
I know...
But there's nothing you can do.

352
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,970
Look here.

353
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,310
He's dead.

354
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,860
But we have our entire lives ahead of us.

355
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,230
Let's leave before anyone sees us.

356
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,780
Yeah?

357
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,220
It won't start, Arjun!

358
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,360
Please, please, start.

359
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,890
-Please...
-Naina.

360
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,030
-Hey, Naina.
-What?

361
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,850
-Someone's coming.
-What?

362
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,690
Get out, now.

363
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,100
-Why?
-Stay right there.

364
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,730
-Where are you going?
-There's someone coming.

365
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,850
Just do as I say.

366
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,680
What happened?
Need any help?

367
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,690
No, mate.
Just a small problem.

368
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,520
Our cars skid. We had a small accident.

369
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,720
Just insurance stuff now.

370
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,270
Need me to call an
ambulance or anything?

371
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,810
No, we're okay.

372
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,980
No damage done.

373
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,570
You sure?

374
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,690
-Yeah.
-Positive.

375
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,570
Must be the insurance.

376
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,890
I'll get back to you right now.

377
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,140
You okay?

378
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,390
Yeah.

379
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,140
Alright.

380
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,810
Everything's good. I'll call you back.

381
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,730
All sorted.

382
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,820
Looks scary.

383
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,440
-Glad nobody got hurt.
-Me, too.

384
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,360
Well...

385
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,320
-Bye.
-Take care.

386
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,360
Take care.

387
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,980
-What are you doing?
-We can't just leave him here now.

388
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,390
What? Why?
We were going to leave, right?

389
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,860
Think, Naina!

390
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,320
It's not the same as before.

391
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,930
That driver is a witness.

392
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,310
If we leave the body here, then he'll
tell the police that we were lying.

393
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,230
Help me, please.

394
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,640
Naina!

395
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,780
You'll have to do it.
It's a manual car, I can't drive it.

396
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,180
So, what am I supposed to do?

397
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,720
Get rid of it.

398
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,560
-Just dump it anywhere you want.
-What?

399
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,530
-No, I can't do it!
-Yes, you can.

400
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,100
-No, Arjun--
-You will have to!

401
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,270
For us.

402
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,320
After this...

403
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,680
if you want us to stop seeing each other.

404
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,350
Done.

405
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,530
Got it? Just keep the keys now. Please.

406
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,810
Arjun convinced me.

407
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,060
I drove for almost an hour,
not knowing where I was headed.

408
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,780
All I could think was...

409
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,280
I wouldn't have overslept
if I hadn't been with Arjun.

410
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,850
If I hadn't taken the left,
the deer wouldn't have crossed my path.

411
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,390
And that boy would've been alive.

412
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,180
Everything would be so different.

413
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,400
Everything will be alright.

414
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,280
Trust me.

415
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,470
And...

416
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,890
what did you do with the car?

417
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,390
-Drowned it.
-With Sunny?

418
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,390
Arjun's words...

419
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,970
still haunt me.

420
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,480
"It was an accident.

421
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,860
He's dead...

422
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,220
but we have our entire lives ahead of us."

423
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,860
That boy was a stranger to me.

424
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
I had to think about my family over him.

425
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,400
Somehow, I consoled myself.

426
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,600
Yeah.

427
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,030
Then?

428
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,980
Then I called Arjun from a
payphone and told him where I was.

429
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,650
What's wrong?

430
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,390
I need a tow truck.

431
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,470
My car ain't working.

432
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,030
What? Where am I?

433
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,820
I don't know!

434
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,820
My GPS is not working,
my car is not starting.

435
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,970
You know what, I can't hear you.
I'm going to call you back.

436
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,570
-Hello.
-Hi.

437
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,530
What's wrong?
I am sorry. Do you speak Hindi?

438
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,430
Yes, I do.

439
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,720
I have a bad habit of
always breaking into Hindi.

440
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,440
-What happened?
-It was just a deer.

441
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,930
It suddenly came in front of my car.

442
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,390
But I am fine. Thank you.

443
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,730
Thank God you're alright.
What happened to the car?

444
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,270
I don't know, it just won't start.

445
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,230
Is there a garage nearby?

446
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,350
Yes, there is.

447
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,100
Sorry, I didn't get you.

448
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,060
Meet my husband, Nimbi.

449
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,180
Nirmal.

450
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,470
But I call him Nimbi.

451
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,530
There is no car in the
world that he can't fix.

452
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,320
Look at ours for instance.

453
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,980
Never spent a penny on its maintenance.

454
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,640
He's an expert.

455
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,560
Come on, help him.

456
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,930
Only if you stop talking for a minute.

457
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,060
Oh! Rani.
Rani Kaur.

458
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,350
Ajay. Ajay Mehta.

459
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,070
Nice to meet you.

460
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,440
There's a lot of Indians in the UK...

461
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,680
hardly any around here.

462
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,350
Could you open the bonnet please?

463
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,430
Sure.

464
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,360
There, next to the accelerator.

465
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,030
Sorry, it's not my car.

466
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,600
-It's my sister's.
-It's okay.

467
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,180
Before meeting him,
I didn't know anything about cars either.

468
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,930
But now, he's turned
me into his assistant.

469
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,850
The world's most terrible assistant.

470
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,860
Be grateful that you at least found one.

471
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,560
It's the starter.
The motor sensor's blocked.

472
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,020
It happens upon a sudden impact.

473
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,390
The unit needs to be reset.

474
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,220
Sorry?

475
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,270
Tell us if you can fix it or not.

476
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,970
Except your brain,
I can fix anything in this world.

477
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,150
But I am going to need my toolbox.

478
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,560
No, thank you.

479
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,900
Please don't worry.

480
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,150
-I'll call up a garage.
-They'll take hours to be here.

481
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,900
Come with us,
our house is quite near.

482
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,890
Thank you, but I don't want to
bother you.

483
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,560
We're not being bothered.

484
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,860
Nimbi will tow your car

485
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,360
-and fix it in a matter of two hours.
-Am I allowed to say anything here?

486
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,480
Go ahead.

487
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,190
I'll tow the car...

488
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,180
and it will take me
an hour to fix it.

489
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,030
That's exactly what I said.

490
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,900
You said two hours.

491
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,730
-You underestimate my talent.
-Forgive me, my talented husband.

492
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,610
Where are you from, Ajay?

493
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,220
-Where are you from?
-London.

494
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,320
Notting Hill.

495
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,480
So what are you doing here?

496
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,890
I was visiting my sister.

497
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,980
-Oh, really? Where does she stay?
-In Elgin.

498
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,980
Really? We used to stay there before.

499
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,390
Nimbi used to work there.

500
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,680
-But then, he got sick.
-He's not interested.

501
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,570
-Of course, he is. Aren't you?
-Yes.

502
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,780
After that, we moved to Aviemore.

503
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,310
It's a quiet place.
Nimbi works at a hotel nearby.

504
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,220
And I stay peacefully at home.

505
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,110
There is barely any
peace with Rani around.

506
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,110
Quiet!

507
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,690
What do you do?

508
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,320
I own a book shop...

509
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,110
-in Notting Hill.
-Oh, wow! Really?

510
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,940
We love reading.
Especially, theater and drama.

511
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,430
That's how I met him.

512
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,640
We both were in a theater group.
But I am a much better actor than him.

513
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,980
-Rubbish!
-Oh, really?

514
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,020
Who won the Best Actor Award for
Twelve Angry Men?

515
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,030
I did.

516
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,720
Okay, fine!

517
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,850
But the audience clapped on my entry.
Not his.

518
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,310
Hi, darling.

519
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,280
-Hi.
-When do you board?

520
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,810
I was just about to call you.
I'll be a little late.

521
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,110
Okay. I'll pick you up from the airport.

522
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,730
-What time do you land?
-No, no...

523
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,110
-I'll come on my own. Don't bother.
-You sure?

524
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,640
I'm taking off anyway.
I'll work from home.

525
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,270
-Great. See you soon.
-Okay. Love you.

526
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
Love you too, babe.

527
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,890
Are you hurt?

528
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,980
No. It was just my wife.

529
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,850
You've got blood on your hand.

530
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,820
Must be the deer, ma'am.
I am fine.

531
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,030
Come on in.

532
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,640
I'll stay here, with the car.

533
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,220
Don't worry. Nimbi won't steal anything.

534
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,530
Thank you.

535
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,270
Come in and wash off the blood.
It might get infected.

536
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,900
I'll make you some hot tea.

537
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,720
Do I get tea?

538
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,530
Only if you admit that
I am the better actor.

539
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,390
Never mind the tea.

540
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,220
It's okay!

541
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,180
Everything okay in there?

542
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,190
-I hope you're not hurt.
-Yes, ma'am.

543
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,600
Everything's okay.

544
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,390
I'll get the tea to
Nimbi and be right back.

545
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,180
Sure, ma'am.
I'll be out in a minute.

546
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,270
Oh, there you are!

547
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,270
Here's your tea.

548
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,980
Sure you don't want anything to eat?

549
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,770
-I am not hungry, ma'am.
-Please sit.

550
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,970
You have a very beautiful home.

551
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,530
Well, home is where the family is.

552
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,400
Do you have any kids?

553
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,280
My wife wants one.

554
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,640
But I am not sure.

555
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,020
You're young, you have time.

556
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,680
Once you have kids, everything changes.

557
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,650
I became a mother after I turned 40.

558
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,030
Wow!

559
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,520
Maybe that's why I spoil my son so much.

560
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,190
He's always glued to
his phone and computer.

561
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,140
Never touches a book.
Just goes on and on about Google...

562
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,780
Excuse me.

563
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,280
Hello.

564
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,780
Hey, Jazz.
Give me a second.

565
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,610
My son, Sunny.

566
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,780
As good looking as me.
Hi, Jazz. Tell me.

567
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,770
Sunny's not home.
He's out with his friends.

568
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,820
You're with them?

569
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,850
He's not there yet?
How's that possible?

570
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,440
He came back from work,
changed and left immediately.

571
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,230
Didn't even eat.

572
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,480
I'll check and let you know.

573
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,570
Where's Sunny?
He's not with his friends.

574
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,310
I don't know.

575
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,060
Call him?

576
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,560
My company has made you intelligent.

577
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,810
Dude, your car's ready.

578
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,270
Sorry, I must've sat on it.

579
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,320
Thanks. Rani.

580
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,730
How come Sunny's phone is here?

581
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
He must have forgotten it.

582
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,020
No way! Sunny never leaves
without his phone.

583
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,220
Call Jazz.

584
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,980
-I just talked to her.
-Sorry...

585
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,810
but I got to go.
My wife...

586
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,390
Hang on.

587
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,680
Here's your lighter.

588
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,350
-I found it in the car.
-Thank you.

589
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,530
It's my sister's.

590
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,320
That cell phone messed everything up.

591
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,770
It was being used until the accident.

592
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,270
He was answering texts.

593
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,220
If anybody checks his phone...

594
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,890
they'll definitely know that I had it.

595
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,230
Shit!

596
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,720
Shit! Shit!

597
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,690
We have to get rid of all the evidence.

598
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,940
Everything.

599
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,930
Arjun's tone scared me.

600
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,560
He insisted that I get rid of my car.

601
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,850
We said our final goodbye.
And promised to never to meet again.

602
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,230
The next day, I reported my car as stolen.

603
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,190
And told everybody that
I had just returned from Paris.

604
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,600
I had to lie to Sunil as well.

605
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,890
Guilt and fear had taken over me.

606
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,150
My company and my family...

607
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,820
both were at stake.

608
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,820
My company expansion meetings
had started happening.

609
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,720
I had to be at work, no matter what.

610
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,970
We had been working on
this deal for a year.

611
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,220
I couldn't risk losing it.

612
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,610
The deal would've taken my
company to the next level.

613
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,390
I just wanted my life to be normal again.

614
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,070
And just when I thought
everything was under control...

615
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,190
20-year-old Sunny Singh Toor,
worked at this bank in Aviemore.

616
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,470
He left work at five o'clock,
stopped at home and then went back out.

617
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,060
His parents were expecting him for dinner

618
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,570
but they haven't heard from him since.

619
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Friends and relatives have joined
the police to search for him,

620
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,110
for many suspect
he may have had an accident

621
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,110
and that his car could have
fallen off a cliff.

622
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,060
If anyone has any
information about my son...

623
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,780
please contact the police.

624
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,360
I'll never forget his mother's face.

625
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,060
I could feel for her...

626
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,720
but there was no way I could help her.

627
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,320
Excuse me.

628
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,650
Yeah, hello?

629
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,440
Yeah. What is it?

630
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,220
Are you sure?

631
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,350
Okay.

632
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,860
Let me know if there's any other news.
Alright. Bye.

633
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,690
The prosecution's witness has
arrived at the police station.

634
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,720
We don't know who it is but...

635
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,600
the judge is on his way.
We have to hurry.

636
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,280
-Where were we?
-Where the hell is Jimmy? Excuse me.

637
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,680
-Hello.
-Where are you?

638
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,390
I've been trying to reach you for so long.

639
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,690
Just landed at Edinburgh.

640
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,810
Still inside the flight.

641
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,860
Badal Gupta is here.

642
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,690
He's saying the prosecutor
has found a new witness.

643
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:02,850
What?

644
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,020
A new witness?

645
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,940
-Who is it?
-How would I know?

646
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,560
-When are you back?
-Tonight.

647
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,360
Let me talk to Badal.

648
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:12,850
Yeah, just a second.

649
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,440
-Jimmy wants to speak to you.
-Yeah.

650
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,610
-Jimmy.
-Mr. Gupta.

651
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,190
What's this bullshit about a new witness?

652
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,020
Not sure, prosecution has
found some new witness.

653
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,600
They have just arrived
at the police station.

654
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,390
-Right now?
-Yeah.

655
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,320
I think...

656
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,900
Naina might be summoned to
the police station tonight.

657
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,470
Hello...

658
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,600
Hello, Mr. Gupta?
I can't hear you.

659
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,780
Can you please text me all the details?

660
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,030
And, Mr. Gupta...

661
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,400
I am leaving Naina in your hands.

662
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,360
I am trying my best here as well.

663
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,070
I might have some good news
in a couple of hours.

664
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,690
-I'll call you.
-Yeah. Okay.

665
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,310
What did he say?

666
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,480
Everything's under control.
Nothing to worry about.

667
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,570
He'll call back.

668
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,900
Yeah, so, where were we?
Shall we continue?

669
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,180
Yeah.

670
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,360
I was trying to get
my life back together--

671
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,070
But the police didn't let you.

672
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,650
How did you know about this?

673
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,970
There's no record of it.

674
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,350
Homework, Naina.

675
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,730
I do my homework.

676
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,770
So that my clients don't have to suffer.

677
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,930
I find out things that others don't.
That is why...

678
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,020
you pay me by the hour.

679
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,360
I was in a meeting when...

680
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,070
Sorry to interrupt.

681
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,400
You have visitors.

682
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,610
Call Jimmy.

683
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,180
At Inverness,
the police have found evidence

684
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,680
of two cars colliding with each other.

685
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,320
About three miles away from
this missing boy's house.

686
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,940
But the accident was never reported.

687
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,650
And the strange thing is
that this boy's parents

688
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,970
met a man that day, who had met with
an accident at the same location.

689
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,100
This man.

690
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,640
Do you know him?

691
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,320
No.

692
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,100
What does my client
have to do with that accident?

693
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,110
This man was driving your client's car.

694
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,930
Audi Q7.

695
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,320
Plate N4 INA...

696
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,890
I know.

697
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,400
It was stolen from a parking lot
that weekend. It's been reported.

698
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,190
I know. But there is no proof that
the car was at the parking lot.

699
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,810
Are you suggesting that
my client is involved with that accident?

700
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,390
I don't know.

701
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,680
Is she?

702
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,060
We're done here. Naina.

703
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,320
Actually, I'd left the
parking ticket inside the car.

704
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,820
I think, someone must have
used it to take the car out.

705
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,530
Possible.

706
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:04,220
But I'd require you to share the
details of your Paris trip.

707
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,480
You'll get them.

708
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,280
Thank you.

709
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,780
Thank you.

710
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,060
I thought you quit.

711
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,320
Please don't tell Sunil.

712
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,280
Why are you nervous?

713
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,390
No, I'm not.

714
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,430
If you aren't nervous,
then I am Amitabh Bachchan.

715
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,720
Seriously?

716
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,530
I know you since college.

717
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,480
Tell me.

718
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,770
Do you know anything about that boy

719
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:39,350
Sunny Singh...

720
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,060
His disappearance?

721
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,520
No.

722
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:46,680
Then what is it?

723
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,060
I was not in Paris.

724
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,560
-I was with someone else.
-What?

725
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,780
Naina!

726
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,310
You made me lie to the police!

727
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,270
Is there a way you can prove
I was in Paris?

728
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,980
Well, I have no other choice.

729
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,560
So you were with that man from the sketch?

730
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,850
It was a mistake.
Won't happen again.

731
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:28,650
I can't let one mistake ruin my life
with Sunil and my daughter.

732
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,930
Next time you need me, make sure
you tell me the truth.

733
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,890
Or get someone else.

734
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,850
How am I supposed to work with this?

735
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,520
I need another favor.

736
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,320
What now?

737
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,180
Can you remove my name
from the police files?

738
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,350
My Japanese deal is going to close.

739
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,220
They cannot find out.

740
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,680
Jimmy took care of Paris...

741
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,570
but not the police records.

742
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,220
One of my sources found
your name in the records.

743
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,770
I would've never done this
if it wasn't for Arjun.

744
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,190
Tell me something.

745
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,440
When you told Arjun the police were
looking for him what did he do?

746
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,110
I never told him.

747
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,060
Can't imagine what he
would've done if I told him.

748
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,430
-I wanted to stay away from him, but--
-But?

749
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,690
Arjun always knew how to get
what he wanted.

750
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,650
He did the same with me...

751
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,610
and was doing the same yet again.

752
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,520
The police have discarded possibility

753
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,890
that Sunny Toor,
the young man who disappeared in Aviemore

754
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,690
three weeks ago, had an accident.

755
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,890
Due to recent reports, he may have stolen
50,000 pounds from this bank branch.

756
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,890
According to a bank spokesperson,

757
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,100
he was taking small amounts
from clients' accounts,

758
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,190
-and then disappeared.
-Hi, there.

759
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,310
-Hi.
-What table number are you?

760
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,480
-Nine.
-Nine.

761
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,220
-Yep?
-I saw the news.

762
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,060
-What did you do?
-Meet me, I'll tell you.

763
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:33,850
Where did you get this?

764
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,270
I took it when we put him in the trunk.

765
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,390
I thought it could be useful later.

766
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,820
And it was.

767
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,030
After the accident, Rachael
worked from home for a few days.

768
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,280
Luckily, the boy worked in
a branch of Rachael's bank.

769
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,770
I used Rachel's card to login.

770
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,310
And used Sunny's card
to take small amounts

771
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,860
from different accounts and
transfer them into Sunny's account.

772
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,280
Hey, hang on.

773
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,280
What are you saying?

774
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,280
Arjun was a photographer...

775
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,060
as well as an expert in
computer banking systems?

776
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,600
The judge will die laughing.
You'll be accused of another murder.

777
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,860
Arjun used to work in a bank first.

778
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:18,680
That's where he met Rachael.

779
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,940
He became a photographer many years later.

780
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:25,720
The characters of your story...

781
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,940
keep developing new skills...

782
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,730
as per their convenience.

783
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,320
First, the invisible
murderer and now this.

784
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,470
That's what he told me.

785
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,520
I don't know how he did
it and I don't care.

786
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,480
Maybe he did it, maybe his
wife helped him... God knows!

787
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,070
Do you want to listen further?

788
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,560
Or we can discuss something else.

789
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,520
No. Please, continue.

790
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,860
I didn't leave a trace.

791
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,640
No one's ever going to find us.

792
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,610
Do you realize what you've done?

793
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,150
Do you?

794
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,600
I am doing this for you.

795
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,230
For us.

796
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,470
Don't look at me like that, Naina.

797
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,180
You're equally responsible
for whatever's happened. Okay?

798
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,600
You could have called the
police, did you?

799
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,690
We're the same, Naina.

800
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,100
-Get used to it.
-No, we're not.

801
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,220
You stopped me from calling the police.

802
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,310
You think whatever you want, sweetheart.

803
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,690
But if I go down...

804
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,770
I am taking you with me.

805
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,110
Are you threatening me?

806
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,470
The police have your sketch.

807
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,020
They do.

808
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,470
But I have something...

809
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,970
that the police don't.

810
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,610
Photos.

811
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,930
Photos that prove you were never in Paris.

812
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,650
So, you stop trying to threaten me.

813
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,940
Are you sure you saw him?

814
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:23,940
Not really sure.

815
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,680
Maybe it was him,
maybe it wasn't.

816
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,060
But what if it was?

817
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:30,690
We'll figure it out.

818
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,780
What happened next?

819
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,690
Over the next few days,
things were getting back to normal.

820
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,400
My company...

821
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,140
my family...

822
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,940
Everything.

823
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:57,430
I closed the Japanese deal and my company
was established into the Asian market.

824
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,570
We got plenty of media attention as well.

825
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,150
The Focus Businessperson of the Year...

826
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,070
Naina Sethi.

827
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,480
I won the Businessperson
of the Year Award.

828
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,140
Must feel nice...

829
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,360
to win the award at such a young age.

830
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,900
Nothing felt nice anymore.

831
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,320
Everything was changing.

832
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,390
I was turning into someone else.

833
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,810
This lady wishes to speak to you.

834
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,150
And then she came about with a mirror...

835
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,100
to show me what I'd turned into.

836
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,650
-Yes?
-Naina?

837
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,780
I am sorry to call
you by your first name.

838
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,030
But you're almost my daughter's age.

839
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,570
Do you know me?

840
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,970
How could I forget that face?

841
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,930
No.

842
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,560
But I know for sure...

843
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,530
you're not Seema Mathews.

844
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,780
I am Sunny's mother.

845
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,520
Rani Kaur.

846
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,520
I know that it's a...

847
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,610
really special occasion for you.

848
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,270
And I am sorry to bother you.

849
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,350
But I had no other choice.

850
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,440
Ma'am, let's just talk there.

851
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,770
-Please.
-Sure.

852
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,680
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about my son.

853
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,690
I only know what I've seen in the news.

854
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,970
My son is not a thief...

855
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:47,980
neither is he on the run.

856
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,720
Whoever has spread this rumor...

857
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,900
is laughing at me and my husband.

858
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,150
The day you were at the police station,

859
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,930
Nimbi and I were there as well.

860
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,890
I don't care what the police believe.

861
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,030
I believe in what I saw.

862
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,150
Sunny was using his cell phone

863
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,280
right until we met this man.

864
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,890
So, it's impossible that
Sunny left his phone home.

865
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,900
Sorry, I must've sat on it.

866
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,820
This man must've gotten it along.

867
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,780
Rani--

868
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,770
And that's only possible if he
would have met with Sunny before.

869
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,930
-Yes, but it's merely an assumption--
-And...

870
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,110
this man wasn't alone in the car.

871
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,720
-There was someone with him.
-How can you be so sure of this?

872
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,600
I have told you already!

873
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,440
He adjusted his car seat before leaving.

874
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,320
It's not my car. It's my sister's.

875
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,940
He wasn't the one driving before.
He lied to us.

876
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,570
Sorry, do you have a lighter?

877
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,930
Yeah.

878
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,480
Here's your lighter.
You must've dropped it in the car.

879
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,190
It's my sister's.

880
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,900
Nobody lies without a cause.

881
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,730
He was either protecting himself...

882
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,570
or you.

883
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,640
-Rani, I was in Paris.
-That's what the police say.

884
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,440
Here's her boarding pass,
hotel reservation

885
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,520
and hotel booking confirmation.

886
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,560
But an airplane ticket and a hotel
reservation prove nothing.

887
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:24,640
Yet, we trusted the
police and returned home.

888
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,570
But then...

889
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,110
We saw the news of our son
being accused of theft.

890
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,720
That's when we realized...

891
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,730
that all information
given to us was a lie.

892
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,560
Nimbi figured that something
terrible has happened to Sunny.

893
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,220
And someone is trying to cover it up.

894
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,440
Only someone really powerful...

895
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,270
can do this.

896
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:56,280
Nimbi said that we cannot
fight such powerful people.

897
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,690
But I wasn't ready to give up.

898
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:03,350
I am his mother. I carried
him for nine months inside me.

899
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,930
I checked every
book store in Notting Hill.

900
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,390
But nobody knew anything about an Ajay.

901
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,030
So, I was left with only one option.

902
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,980
You.

903
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,930
You have the money as well as the power.

904
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,770
And the fear of losing them both.

905
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,350
That's why you had to hide everything

906
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,070
to prove that you were in Paris.

907
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:33,400
And not in fact, with another man.

908
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,230
I went back to tell this to the police

909
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,390
but they just wouldn't listen.

910
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:43,180
That's when I realized
how powerful you are.

911
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,640
But I don't fear you.

912
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:50,020
Fear is for those who have a lot to lose.

913
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:51,770
Like you.

914
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,610
For someone who has lost her child

915
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,350
along with a husband,
who's dying in the hospital.

916
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,220
There is nothing else
that can cause any fear.

917
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,780
The security will soon find
out, I am not Seema Mathews.

918
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,930
Please tell me. Where is my son?

919
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,350
-Ma'am, you're mistaken, I--
-Don't you take me for a fool!

920
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,770
Because when we picked up
Ajay, you weren't there.

921
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,400
Where were you?

922
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,480
You are responsible for
my son's disappearance.

923
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,230
Aren't you, Naina?

924
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:33,270
You snatched my son away from me.
Was it really that easy, Naina?

925
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,820
Tell me.

926
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,060
Naina?

927
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,320
-Did you really--
-No.

928
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,640
I beg of you...

929
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,470
please tell me the truth.
Where is my son?

930
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,360
As a mother,
please help out another mother.

931
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,400
I know my son is dead.

932
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,220
I just want to see him one last time.

933
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,560
Come with us, please.

934
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,070
Don't touch me.

935
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,610
-Please, ma'am.
-It's okay.

936
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,320
Power is the worst kind of addiction.

937
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,530
Because those addicted to power...

938
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:27,470
fail to foresee their own fall.

939
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,940
Imagine, Naina...

940
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,470
If it were your child...

941
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,680
the child of such a powerful woman.

942
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:39,060
To what extent would you
go to save your child?

943
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,390
And then there's me.

944
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,320
Someone with nothing to lose.

945
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,270
The things this mother will do,
for her child...

946
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,470
you cannot even imagine.

947
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,640
So, did you hear from Rani again?

948
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,600
I told Jimmy about it.

949
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,270
I asked him to keep an eye on her.

950
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,280
Rani understood that it was
best for her to stay away from me.

951
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:49,320
She never tried to contact me again.

952
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,110
Okay.

953
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,480
Now we have everything.

954
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,320
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

955
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,440
I've told you everything.

956
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,680
Okay.

957
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,060
Now let's see what we have.

958
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,810
Two dead bodies-
Sunny Singh and Arjun Joseph.

959
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:20,350
The police are aware of Arjun because
that's the only body they found.

960
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,440
And a suspect, you.

961
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:26,230
But we and Sunny's parents know that...

962
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:30,530
there's another body which
hasn't been found yet.

963
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,470
The parents suspect that...

964
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,190
you and Arjun are responsible...

965
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,440
for the death of their son.

966
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,070
They're convinced about Arjun
because they saw him there...

967
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,360
and not so convinced about you.

968
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,930
So, between us...

969
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,070
we can assume...

970
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:02,140
that Arjun's murder is connected...

971
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:04,930
to Sunny's death.

972
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,350
And if it is...

973
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:14,230
-then Arjun's murderer...
-Is connected to Sunny's death.

974
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:18,770
Maybe.

975
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:22,320
But you're forgetting someone.

976
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,110
Who?

977
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:30,560
That driver, who saw us with Sunny's car.

978
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,280
Do you think the judge will believe

979
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,600
that a random driver who
crossed paths with you...

980
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,900
is the blackmailer?

981
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,570
Maybe.

982
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,980
Maybe he found out who I was and
that Arjun wasn't my husband.

983
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,520
No "maybes," Naina.
We need facts.

984
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,560
The judge won't buy this theory.

985
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,140
I didn't tell you how the
blackmailer contacted us.

986
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,220
I thought you told me everything.

987
01:03:58,730 --> 01:03:59,900
This came for you.

988
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,780
I know what you did with your lover.

989
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:12,060
The price of my silence
is a 100,000 pounds.

990
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,350
In small unmarked bills.

991
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,310
At 5:00 p.m. sharp.

992
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,430
Be at the Aviemore train station.

993
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,570
I'll call the phone booth
in the parking lot...

994
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,900
and I'll tell you where
to deliver the money.

995
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,560
Don't come alone or without the money.

996
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,900
Else, I will send this photo to the police

997
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,320
so they can find Sunny Singh Toor.

998
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:38,530
Naina.

999
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,650
How do you expect me to believe this?

1000
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,280
Why?

1001
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:46,640
How could the driver know...

1002
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,020
where you hid the car?

1003
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,030
That sound.

1004
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,610
I heard something before I
drowned the car. Remember?

1005
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,180
What if it wasn't a deer?

1006
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,530
What if he saw something?

1007
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,730
Bye.

1008
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:05,180
What if he followed me?

1009
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,400
Enough, Naina.

1010
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,150
That's enough, please.

1011
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,140
The driver...

1012
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:24,060
sees everything and
calls you at the hotel...

1013
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,850
for the money.

1014
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,470
Sounds believable.

1015
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:33,470
But someone, who's only motivation
is the money, suddenly changes his mind

1016
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,560
kills Arjun,
slams your head in the mirror...

1017
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,360
and disappears.

1018
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,390
Without even taking the money that he
wanted in the first place. I mean...

1019
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:45,310
Seriously?

1020
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,860
I am just trying to say that
it is one of the possibilities--

1021
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,650
No, Naina. No!

1022
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,100
What you're trying is to create a distance
between you and Sunny.

1023
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:59,190
So that the entire focus is shifted

1024
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,430
from you to the blackmailer

1025
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,110
who murdered Arjun.
Am I right?

1026
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:11,270
You said you find out things that
others miss out on.

1027
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,860
So, you tell me,
what could have happened instead?

1028
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:16,770
Okay.

1029
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:18,720
Okay.

1030
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:20,780
I have three questions for you.

1031
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:24,980
If you answer any one them correctly...

1032
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,930
I'll believe in your
"blackmailer killer" theory.

1033
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,280
First:

1034
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,610
How do you explain the message
you received on your cell phone?

1035
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,190
Second:

1036
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,150
If the blackmailer wanted money,

1037
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,560
why did he leave without it?

1038
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,650
And third:

1039
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,180
How did he get in and out of
a locked room?

1040
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,280
You see?

1041
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,820
You're giving the prosecutor
exactly what he wants to hear.

1042
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,060
You just made his job easy.

1043
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:13,280
Fine. But there was a blackmailer.

1044
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,600
The one who murdered Arjun.

1045
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,140
I believe you.

1046
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:23,190
Even the judge will believe that there
was a blackmailer and a murderer.

1047
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,320
But...

1048
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,230
how will you hide these three
questions from the law?

1049
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,350
Mr. Gupta...

1050
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:37,690
I am paying you by the hour, right?

1051
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,770
I am not paying you to find
faults in my testimony, am I?

1052
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,140
I am paying you...

1053
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:46,610
to find these answers.

1054
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:48,890
So, you tell me...

1055
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,060
what must have happened?

1056
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,220
Okay.

1057
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,980
You came up with a theory.

1058
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,720
Now, let me create mine.

1059
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:04,030
Let me formulate a theory
that answers these three questions.

1060
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,720
So, let's start with the blackmailer...

1061
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:12,570
who was supposed to contact you at
five o'clock, at the Aviemore station.

1062
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,860
Arjun went alone.

1063
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:21,860
Because he didn't want you both
to be seen together.

1064
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,470
Then the blackmailer instructed you

1065
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,720
to go to the
Glen Mohr Hotel with the money.

1066
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,520
Room 303.

1067
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,810
Also, he told Arjun
to leave his phone inside the bin.

1068
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:37,600
There was only one way
to get to the hotel.

1069
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,390
The train.

1070
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,900
But the question remains.

1071
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,820
Why did the blackmailer change his mind?

1072
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,390
If he wanted the money...

1073
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:51,890
then why didn't he take it?

1074
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,060
Wait.

1075
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,360
I'll go and find out.
Stay right here.

1076
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:21,470
Thank you.

1077
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,650
-Hello. Good evening, sir.
-Hi.

1078
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:26,070
I have a booking. Room 303.

1079
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,780
303...

1080
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,030
Under the name Naina Sethi?

1081
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,180
Is that correct?

1082
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,280
I just need you to sign this form for me.

1083
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,520
I'll go and get your room key.

1084
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,690
Until you both arrived,
the room key was at the reception

1085
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:47,060
from where it went straight to Arjun.

1086
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,520
-Did anybody see you?
-No.

1087
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,970
You both had no idea that someone
was already present in the room.

1088
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,060
Whoever was hiding in the room...

1089
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,320
waited for it to get dark.

1090
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:23,600
Why?

1091
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,570
Because he wasn't
interested in your money.

1092
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:31,680
Arjun.

1093
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,860
-What's wrong?
-I received a text from your phone.

1094
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:35,860
It's a trap. I'll get the money.
Let's get out of here.

1095
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,390
Naina?

1096
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:42,850
Naina?

1097
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,730
So, you think Rani did this?

1098
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,070
Don't you?

1099
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,640
For the judge to believe you...

1100
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,060
Rani is our best choice.

1101
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,110
Rani Kaur had a strong motive.

1102
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,650
The police weren't ready
to believe her either.

1103
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:17,930
There was nothing else she could do...

1104
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:21,520
but to make you reveal the truth.

1105
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,470
To make you confess.

1106
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,810
She wanted to murder one of us...

1107
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:31,480
and pin the accusation on the other.

1108
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,860
-That was her plan.
-Correct.

1109
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,820
And that's what she did.

1110
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,480
Everybody believes that
you're the murderer.

1111
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,440
The police, your husband,

1112
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,220
your Japanese partners...
Everybody.

1113
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,440
Rani destroyed your life and your career.

1114
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:52,360
Only Jimmy...

1115
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,310
managed to bail you out.

1116
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,310
And he paid a large
amount of money for that.

1117
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,930
Then the two of you...

1118
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,520
came up with this absurd
"blackmailer" theory

1119
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,810
and Jimmy came to me.

1120
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:09,020
Jimmy knew that if you
could convince me with this story...

1121
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,850
then we could convince the judge too.

1122
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,890
Badal Gupta.

1123
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,560
Who is he?

1124
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,280
Badal Gupta is the best.

1125
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:22,270
He's an expert at preparing witnesses.

1126
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,820
You know, he announced his
retirement four weeks ago.

1127
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,980
But I've somehow convinced
him to fight your case.

1128
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,650
What do you mean he prepares witnesses?

1129
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,820
-He'll tell me what to say in the court?
-Naina, consider yourself lucky.

1130
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,980
He has not lost a case in 40 years.

1131
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,400
And I don't intend to lose
my last one either.

1132
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:52,690
But I must admit, it will be fun
to face an opponent like Rani.

1133
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,600
What a...

1134
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,020
What a brilliant game she has played!

1135
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,860
-Brilliant!
-Meaning?

1136
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,140
Meaning look at her plan.

1137
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,470
If you want to prove yourself innocent...

1138
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,720
then you'll have to pin
the accusation on Rani.

1139
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,030
And to do that, you'll have to tell...

1140
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,360
what you did to Sunny.

1141
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,640
You're right.

1142
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:20,230
But the question is,

1143
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,890
how did Rani get out of the
room without leaving a trace?

1144
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,820
Because, when I woke up

1145
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,650
there was nobody in the room.
I am 100% sure about it.

1146
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:30,890
The answer to that too...

1147
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,020
lies in the details.

1148
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,770
Mr. Gupta, please don't mind...

1149
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:42,480
but I'm starting to get sick
of your riddles now.

1150
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,480
If A=E, B=F,

1151
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,390
C=G, D=H...

1152
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,230
then E=?

1153
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,310
-I?
-Sure?

1154
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,570
I say, A.

1155
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:11,070
Oh, back to where we started.

1156
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:14,860
Like how we go all over
searching for a particular answer

1157
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:19,280
but the answer in fact, is always
right in front of us.

1158
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,770
These are all the police photos

1159
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:27,190
of your case.

1160
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:29,900
We'll find the answers right here.

1161
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:36,480
But what are we looking for?

1162
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,470
Concentrate on the details.

1163
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,470
You were too busy looking for the "6."

1164
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:53,600
While the "9" was always
right in front of you.

1165
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,980
The murder took place inside the room.

1166
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:01,150
But the evidence was outside.

1167
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,470
Is that?

1168
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,730
Right.

1169
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,530
Nirmal Singh Toor.

1170
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:15,970
Sunny's father.

1171
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,820
Arjun told me he works at a hotel...

1172
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:29,020
Glen Mohr Hotel!

1173
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,650
Rani set up a trap...

1174
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:35,640
and you fell right into it.

1175
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,070
She sent you that packet...

1176
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,360
and made you see what she wanted

1177
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,650
not what you should've seen.

1178
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,280
Hello.

1179
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,430
Have you got the money?

1180
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:00,030
-Have you got the money?
-Yes.

1181
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,530
-She only wanted--
-Arjun.

1182
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,570
Correct.

1183
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,390
You're a quick learner.

1184
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,140
I should make you my assistant.

1185
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,940
-But how could Rani know about the swamp?
-Man!

1186
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,430
Just when I thought you were learning!

1187
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,400
Naina...

1188
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,850
that area is full of swamps.

1189
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,970
Anybody would have dumped
the car in a swamp. Even I would.

1190
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:26,270
She sent you the picture
of a random swamp.

1191
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,470
You panicked...

1192
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:30,440
and led her straight to Arjun.

1193
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,140
Then?

1194
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:35,900
Then you got impressed
and offered me some coffee.

1195
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,470
And I didn't refuse.

1196
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:43,560
Sorry. I'll just get a coffee for you.

1197
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,020
So, Rani found Arjun.

1198
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,430
Then what?

1199
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,820
Rani wanted...
Hey, this is really good coffee.

1200
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,020
Rani wanted Arjun's phone.

1201
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:59,020
So she could use it
to send you that message.

1202
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:02,890
And make you the prime suspect...

1203
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:04,690
of Arjun's murder.

1204
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:29,470
You were busy talking, while she
took the lead and reached the hotel.

1205
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,220
Then?

1206
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,470
Before the "then!"

1207
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:54,270
-What's this?
-Homework.

1208
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,020
The floor plan of Glen Mohr Hotel.

1209
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:01,930
Third floor.

1210
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,190
Here's room 303.

1211
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:07,850
And the store room right next to it.

1212
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,900
To which, only the hotel employees
have access to.

1213
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:13,150
-So?
-So, let's continue with the story.

1214
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:21,150
Nirmal had already
kept the room unlocked for Rani.

1215
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,440
Hence, they chose room 303...

1216
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,730
so that they could communicate.

1217
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,680
And that key...

1218
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,310
That's the only key which
unlocks and locks the windows.

1219
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,820
And that's how Rani got into
the locked room without a trace.

1220
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,020
Then, all she had to do was wait.

1221
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,730
-Thank you.
-Room 303.

1222
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,850
I just need your signature...

1223
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,770
on this form.

1224
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,970
303.

1225
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,280
Under the name Naina Sethi?

1226
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:16,280
Just sign at the bottom,
I'll get you your key.

1227
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:29,600
-Did anybody see you?
-No.

1228
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,180
All Nirmal had to do,
was send you the text

1229
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,470
to make it look like Arjun
was going to betray you.

1230
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,100
Grab your coat, I'll take the money.
Let's get out of here.

1231
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,060
Naina?

1232
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,230
Naina?

1233
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,280
You were completely trapped.

1234
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,470
The text on your phone.

1235
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:57,280
The room booked under your name.

1236
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:59,560
The money left behind.

1237
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,720
And finally...

1238
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,480
your fingerprints.

1239
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:03,680
Hello?

1240
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,400
Is everything alright?

1241
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,430
We heard some screams.

1242
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,610
Voila!

1243
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:27,560
The invisible murderer!

1244
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,030
Both Rani...

1245
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,350
and Nirmal executed their plan perfectly.

1246
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,730
Here, open it.

1247
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,430
Arjun...

1248
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,720
Hands where I can see them.

1249
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,600
Can someone help me please?

1250
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:53,230
It was Nirmal's responsibility to
make Rani disappear from the locked room.

1251
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,940
So there's only one suspect remaining.

1252
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,100
You.

1253
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,360
You know?

1254
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:11,930
Yeah?

1255
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,430
Tell me.

1256
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:20,850
Confirmed?

1257
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,320
Okay.

1258
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:26,680
Thank you.

1259
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:38,180
The prosecutor's witness?

1260
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:39,480
Yeah.

1261
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:42,690
It's Arjun's wife.

1262
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:45,270
Rachael.

1263
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:49,640
Rachael?

1264
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,400
But why?

1265
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,400
-Why would Rachael testify against me?
-I don't know.

1266
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,430
I don't know.

1267
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,440
Did you do something to her?

1268
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:07,230
to her...

1269
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,190
husband?

1270
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:15,520
-I never thought--
-Neither did I.

1271
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,520
I didn't think either.

1272
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:25,230
We have no idea...

1273
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,520
about the information she has.

1274
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:30,610
No idea at all.

1275
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,100
What do I do?

1276
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:45,110
Exactly what I tell you.

1277
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,110
Let's assume...

1278
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,310
that Rachael will testify against you,
stating Arjun was about to expose you

1279
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,940
and that's why you killed him.

1280
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,720
-But I didn't kill him.
-Naina, please!

1281
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,520
Don't you realize that you're trapped?

1282
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:07,480
And to get you out,
we'll have to lay a trap for Rani.

1283
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:12,470
We know that Rani is the murderer.

1284
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:17,470
But nobody will believe it unless...

1285
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,310
Unless Sunny's body is found.

1286
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:22,820
What?

1287
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,930
-How will that help?
-Link! Motive!

1288
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:29,650
Sunny dead body is the only
link between Rani and Arjun.

1289
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:33,020
But finding the body will lead
to another set of hundred questions...

1290
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:34,810
Tackle the existing
set of questions first.

1291
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,070
We'll think about the others later.

1292
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:39,860
Now.

1293
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:42,020
Let us assume...

1294
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,930
Let us assume that you were really in
Paris on the day of the accident.

1295
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,110
Arjun alone rented the cabin.

1296
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,970
His is the only name on record.

1297
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:54,480
And when he left, alone...

1298
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,270
He was driving your car because

1299
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,970
you might have given it to him.
It's quite common between lovers.

1300
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,280
Hence, that day he was alone...

1301
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,470
and alone, he drowned
Sunny's car into the swamp.

1302
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,470
We just need to convince the judge that

1303
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,600
you are also one of Arjun's victims,
and that you were in room 303

1304
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:28,810
because he asked you to be there.

1305
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:36,600
Wait, wait...

1306
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,980
Until then, you knew nothing about Sunny.

1307
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,030
That's why Rani killed
Arjun and spared you.

1308
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:45,110
Okay.

1309
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:47,400
But how will finding Sunny's body help us?

1310
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,020
Only then can we connect Arjun directly
to Sunny's disappearance.

1311
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,480
I mean, think about it.

1312
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,400
What if the police...

1313
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:03,400
was to find one of Arjun's belongings
in the car with Sunny?

1314
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:10,890
That will prove that Arjun is responsible
for Sunny's death.

1315
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,770
And Rani killed Arjun
to avenge Sunny's death.

1316
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:21,430
I need you to remember and tell me exactly

1317
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,600
where you dumped the car.

1318
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,940
If we inform the police
about Sunny's dead body...

1319
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,100
won't they figure out
that I was there too?

1320
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,730
Obviously, we won't straight up
inform the police.

1321
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,280
They will receive...

1322
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,860
an anonymous phone call,
saying there's a car in the lake.

1323
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:43,150
And when they find the car

1324
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:44,470
they will discover the body.

1325
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,930
-You're making a mistake, Mr. Gupta.
-I don't make mistakes.

1326
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:52,220
If there is no body...

1327
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:53,860
then there is no murder.

1328
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,110
And if there is no murder...

1329
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,430
then Rani doesn't have
a motive for revenge.

1330
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,280
And Rachael?

1331
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,350
What about her?

1332
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,690
What if she proves that
I was with Arjun that weekend?

1333
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,680
There is no Rachael.

1334
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:16,360
There is no witness.

1335
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:19,110
I lied.

1336
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,430
You lied to me?

1337
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,390
-Why?
-To know the truth.

1338
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,350
You lied to me as well.

1339
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:30,480
Why?

1340
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:36,680
To see if you could explain Rani's
disappearance from that room or not.

1341
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,020
I always knew that she was there.

1342
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,360
I saw her too.

1343
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:51,390
It wasn't tough to figure that
Rani's husband worked there.

1344
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,900
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1345
01:26:57,730 --> 01:27:01,610
To see if hiring you was a mistake or not.

1346
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:06,650
You know, there's a reason I won
Businessperson of the Year Award.

1347
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:09,280
So what do you think?

1348
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,270
I think I can trust you.

1349
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,430
There's something else I haven't told you.

1350
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:37,980
What?

1351
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,770
-Sunny was still alive.
-What!

1352
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,400
Sunny was alive?

1353
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:01,320
I didn't know, I swear.
We thought he was dead.

1354
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:03,230
What did you do?

1355
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,310
What else could I have done?

1356
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,930
It was too late.

1357
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,600
You do understand why I didn't
tell you this before?

1358
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:38,780
I had to be sure if you could
save me from this mess or not.

1359
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:40,680
Yeah.

1360
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,900
Because after the autopsy,
the police would find out...

1361
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:47,220
that Sunny died not due to the accident

1362
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,600
but in fact, due to drowning.

1363
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,480
I didn't have the time to think.

1364
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,970
Are you lying to me or to yourself?

1365
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,180
It was a clear murder, Naina.

1366
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,020
-Committed by you.
-No, not by me.

1367
01:28:58,650 --> 01:28:59,650
By Arjun.

1368
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:02,930
You just proved that Arjun killed Sunny.

1369
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:06,100
So whatever the autopsy reveals
will hold Arjun responsible, not me.

1370
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:07,690
No, Naina!

1371
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:09,390
You're not getting it.

1372
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,470
This changes everything.

1373
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,220
I came here to find the real murderer...

1374
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,850
not to defend one.

1375
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,400
Nothing has changed.

1376
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:22,720
I'm still paying you by the hour.

1377
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,100
Your job is to defend me, right?

1378
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,440
So please stick to your job
and defend me.

1379
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,440
I am not going to let
you ruin my record.

1380
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,430
Good.

1381
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:05,110
That's the spirit.

1382
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,070
Yeah.

1383
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,850
But now, you must
tell me the whole truth.

1384
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,360
I've told you everything.

1385
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,190
Then why do I feel,
that whatever you said...

1386
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:21,390
was only in fact to test me?

1387
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:26,060
Whatever I believed would be the truth
and what I didn't, are lies.

1388
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,900
What is it that you don't believe now?

1389
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,100
Maybe everything happened
the way you said it did.

1390
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,070
But then again, it's you who said it.

1391
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:44,820
Is it actually a "6" as you showed me

1392
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:48,480
or in fact a "9" you tried to hide?

1393
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:55,020
It's possible that after
watching that news...

1394
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:58,900
Arjun was the one who called you up...

1395
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:00,930
and not the other way around.

1396
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,810
...disappeared in Aviemore,
three weeks ago, had an accident.

1397
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:08,230
Due to recent reports, he may have stolen
50,000 pounds from this bank branch.

1398
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:10,600
According to a bank spokesperson...

1399
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:15,470
-Hi there.
-Yeah.

1400
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,020
What did you do, Naina?

1401
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,350
Meet me, I'll tell you.

1402
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:27,310
And listen,
don't ever call me on my mobile.

1403
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:44,850
Where did you get this?

1404
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,230
You dumped the car.

1405
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:51,680
It was easier for you to
take that wallet, than Arjun.

1406
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:56,270
Also creating that false story about
Sunny being a thief...

1407
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,470
must have been an easy job for Jimmy.

1408
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:01,720
Now that's a lie!

1409
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,720
Justice is blind, remember.

1410
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,320
The truth is only what can be proven.

1411
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,030
Okay, go ahead!

1412
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,030
Okay.

1413
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:14,780
Let's reverse roles, shall we?

1414
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:19,980
You alright?

1415
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:21,440
Shit!

1416
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:25,940
Hey!

1417
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:27,770
Are you okay?

1418
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,030
-Who are you calling?
-The police.

1419
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,310
-Why?
-We must report the accident.

1420
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,270
It wasn't our fault.

1421
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:40,220
He wasn't wearing his seat belt.

1422
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,440
He was texting. It wasn't our fault.

1423
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:47,310
There is a reason you won Businessperson
of the Year Award after all.

1424
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,230
-What are you doing?
-We can't just leave him here.

1425
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,470
Why?

1426
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:02,480
Are you blind?
That driver has seen everything.

1427
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:03,850
Now come and help me!

1428
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:06,680
You dragged Arjun into this.

1429
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,530
No, I could never do that.

1430
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:13,810
You could have saved that kid
but you decided to drown him.

1431
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,270
You can do anything, Naina.

1432
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:20,780
Arjun.

1433
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,100
Arjun was the one
having sleepless nights.

1434
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:26,180
It was Arjun...

1435
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,860
who couldn't take it anymore.

1436
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:36,930
That's when he realized that
there was only one thing he could do.

1437
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,640
He couldn't bring their son back...

1438
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,140
but he could tell them the truth.

1439
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:49,150
Arjun knew that you'd never agree to it.

1440
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:54,680
That's why he didn't leave
you a choice.

1441
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:57,810
Arjun went to meet the parents...

1442
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:01,980
at the same hotel where Nirmal worked.

1443
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:04,350
He went by himself...

1444
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:06,900
and called you from a phone booth.

1445
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,730
-Naina, somebody knows the truth.
-What?

1446
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:14,310
He made you believe that the
driver had seen everything

1447
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,320
and that he was blackmailing him.

1448
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,860
And you fell for it.

1449
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:24,930
Arjun wanted to confess
everything to Sunny's parents.

1450
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,110
And as a way of compensating them...

1451
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,520
he got you to bring the money.

1452
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:34,140
And as for the message
that he sent you...

1453
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,970
Nowadays, people break up
over text messages...

1454
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:41,940
because they fear confrontation.

1455
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:45,430
So did he.

1456
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,810
He knew that you don't
care about anything in this world.

1457
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,770
Except...

1458
01:34:57,810 --> 01:34:58,850
for yourself.

1459
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,110
And you rushed.

1460
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,970
Arjun knew that you'd
comfortably manipulate him.

1461
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,400
But this time, he was determined.

1462
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:26,360
He wasn't going to back down.

1463
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:27,860
That is why...

1464
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,020
he sent you that text.

1465
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:51,690
What is this?

1466
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,940
Arjun told you about his plan.

1467
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:58,070
This money is also for them.

1468
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:02,030
I will tell them the truth.

1469
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:04,350
And you will tell them where their son is.

1470
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:08,310
Then we'll go to the police.

1471
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,480
And it went, as he feared it would.

1472
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:12,280
You refused.

1473
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,600
We're not going to do any such thing.

1474
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,730
We're leaving right now!

1475
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,270
We don't have time for that, Naina.

1476
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,890
I've called them here already.

1477
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:20,640
They will be here any moment.

1478
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:23,820
Then let's get the hell out of here.

1479
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:25,680
They cannot see us together.
Let's go.

1480
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,280
There's nothing you can do now.

1481
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:32,780
The room is booked under your name.

1482
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,100
They know you are here.

1483
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,820
You were trapped.

1484
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:43,180
And there was only one way out for you.

1485
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,110
Arjun.

1486
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:59,150
Look, I didn't kill Arjun!

1487
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,610
-So, I'll never admit that--
-Wait.

1488
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:04,190
I am yet to come to the best part.

1489
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,860
You're trapped in a locked room with a
dead body and no way to escape.

1490
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,430
What do you do?

1491
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,480
Tell me.

1492
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,720
Is everything all right?

1493
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:22,570
We heard some screams.

1494
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:23,980
Hello?

1495
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,520
Hello?

1496
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:28,860
Hello?

1497
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,890
Is everything all right?

1498
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:41,980
Hello?

1499
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,650
Hello?

1500
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:54,360
Is everything all right?

1501
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,850
You thought that message
could be useful later.

1502
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,390
And your mind started weaving a story.

1503
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:13,570
Hello?

1504
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:15,780
Hello?

1505
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:17,890
Hello?

1506
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,060
Is everything all right?

1507
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:23,360
This story had a blackmailer...

1508
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,970
who took Arjun's phone.

1509
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:27,850
And a mother...

1510
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:30,270
who wanted revenge.

1511
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:33,110
Police! Is everything okay in there?

1512
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:36,720
Police!
Can you open the door?

1513
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:40,070
Open the door, now!

1514
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,730
Open the door.

1515
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:55,980
All this while...

1516
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:00,810
I thought I was playing the game
of Chausar against Rani Kaur.

1517
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:03,690
But you, Naina Sethi...

1518
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:08,360
you outdid even Duryodhana.

1519
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:11,280
You want to play?

1520
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:13,780
Let's play.

1521
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:18,570
According to your theory, Arjun had told
the truth to Rani and Nirmal already.

1522
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,320
Then why didn't they go to the police?

1523
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,150
You already know the answer to that.

1524
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:24,320
But you know everything!
So you tell me.

1525
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:28,310
They know...

1526
01:39:29,690 --> 01:39:32,570
that you will never convict yourself
by revealing where the body is.

1527
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,720
That you will do anything
to get away with it.

1528
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,230
Even spin Arjun's murder around...

1529
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:41,820
to convict Rani for it.

1530
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:47,530
Come here.

1531
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:50,820
Come here.

1532
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,390
Look at that window.

1533
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:00,860
Carefully.

1534
01:40:04,810 --> 01:40:05,770
Rani.

1535
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,360
Rani stopped believing in the
police a long time ago.

1536
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:18,270
She wanted to seek revenge against you...

1537
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,390
on her own.

1538
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,610
How do you know this?

1539
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:28,150
Nobody knows Rani better than I do.

1540
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:31,610
How?

1541
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:33,640
Think...

1542
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:36,770
How, Mr. Gupta?

1543
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,520
When Rani and Nirmal
arrived at the hotel...

1544
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:47,390
they heard about Arjun's murder.

1545
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:50,360
They didn't know what to do.

1546
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,060
Rani had already confronted you.

1547
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:56,900
And she knew the police would do nothing.

1548
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,220
So, she watched you.

1549
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:04,150
Rani became your shadow.

1550
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,110
If you do leave, you may be
placed under arrest.

1551
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:15,930
She took an apartment
in the building across...

1552
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:18,440
only to keep an eye on you.

1553
01:41:19,310 --> 01:41:20,560
I'll take it.

1554
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:25,470
She saw the people you hired.

1555
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:30,520
She saw everything you
did to save yourself.

1556
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:32,780
Including me.

1557
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,940
Following Jimmy, led her to me.

1558
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,980
I wondered, "Who was that
woman taking my pictures?"

1559
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:47,430
So, I had her followed...

1560
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,110
to find the truth.

1561
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,600
So, you knew everything
about Sunny already?

1562
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:55,530
Then why did you interrogate me?

1563
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:57,770
You know, there's a saying.

1564
01:41:59,150 --> 01:42:01,780
"For he is a fool,
who knows only the truth...

1565
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:05,470
but not the difference
between the lies and the truth."

1566
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:08,680
Don't tell me this too
is from the Mahabharata?

1567
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,100
This is what Lord Krishna said to Arjuna.

1568
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:14,900
See, Naina. I knew the truth.

1569
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:16,820
But...

1570
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:19,480
I wanted to know the lies as well.

1571
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,970
You know nothing!

1572
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:26,400
This photo proves that
Nirmal was there that day.

1573
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,980
And he helped Rani escape.

1574
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:30,650
No.

1575
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:33,110
Nirmal was on a leave that day.

1576
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:35,850
He and Rani were at the hotel...

1577
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,570
-only to meet Arjun.
-Lies!

1578
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,530
Nirmal is in the photo!

1579
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:42,520
Are you blind, Mr. Gupta?

1580
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:45,270
Do you really think...

1581
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:48,390
that I am blind, Naina?

1582
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:51,100
Is that why you hired me?

1583
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:56,480
This photo is a fake.
Look carefully.

1584
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:02,850
The details, Naina.

1585
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:05,650
Details that you always overlook.

1586
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:07,530
Look at this photo.

1587
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,150
Look at the mirror.

1588
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:16,140
Nirmal's reflection is not in the mirror.

1589
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:20,820
I made this photo...

1590
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:22,810
for you.

1591
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:26,190
So that I could turn your lies into truth.

1592
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:32,440
I hope you now realize
the importance of details.

1593
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,470
Have you ever realized

1594
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,600
how much you need me?
Have you?

1595
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:42,070
To turn your
pathetic lies into truth.

1596
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:44,430
To keep you out of jail.
Have you realized?

1597
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:45,520
No!

1598
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:55,770
I...
I am sorry.

1599
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:57,900
My apologies.
I...

1600
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:59,970
spoke out of line.
I...

1601
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,720
I apologize.

1602
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:02,970
But...

1603
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:06,430
Ms. Sethi, I can't represent you.

1604
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:10,860
If there is no trust between us...

1605
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,100
it's pointless.

1606
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,530
-You should look for...
-No, listen.

1607
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,640
-another lawyer to represent you.
-No, Mr. Gupta. Listen to me.

1608
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:18,150
-I want you to represent me.
-I won't.

1609
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:19,400
I want you as my lawyer.

1610
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:23,320
Then you'll have to
tell me one more truth!

1611
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:25,980
What do you want to know?

1612
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:28,440
Did you kill Arjun?

1613
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,230
Yes.

1614
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:36,400
Everything happened the way you said.

1615
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:40,220
You see?

1616
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:42,850
It wasn't that difficult
to tell the truth.

1617
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:48,570
So, thank you for having faith in me.

1618
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:50,030
It will be an honor...

1619
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:52,020
to represent you.

1620
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:54,140
Thank you.

1621
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,980
So I hope I won't have to go to jail now.

1622
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,060
And that, the judge
will believe our story.

1623
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:02,360
Revenge is a strong motive.

1624
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:06,940
Even the Mahabharata was
a revenge saga of the Pandavas.

1625
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:08,530
I won't lose your case.

1626
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:10,570
But...

1627
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:15,690
I'm going to need coffee because I'll
have to work all night.

1628
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:17,810
Leave a message after this.

1629
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:19,900
Naina. Your phone's off.

1630
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:21,320
Call me. I have good news.

1631
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,940
Good news, huh?

1632
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:27,140
Looks like your luck is changing.

1633
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:30,600
You should call him back.

1634
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:32,930
Meanwhile, I'll call my wife too.

1635
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,930
I need to tell her I won't
make it home tonight.

1636
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:37,600
-You can use my room.
-No.

1637
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,600
Outside. Some fresh air...

1638
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:43,070
I also need to think
what to do with you.

1639
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:45,470
-Mr. Gupta.
-Yeah?

1640
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:47,680
Thank you.

1641
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,360
Draupadi.

1642
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,690
Mahabharata...

1643
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,810
was Draupadi's revenge saga...

1644
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:04,430
not the Pandavas'.

1645
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:07,270
Draupadi told Yudhishthira

1646
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:09,940
it is not right to seek
revenge every time.

1647
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:14,940
But it is also not right
to forgive every time either.

1648
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:21,850
Yeah?

1649
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,070
-Hi, Jimmy.
-Naina.

1650
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,150
I found the driver.
Now, you were never there.

1651
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:43,280
Can we trust him?

1652
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,390
Hundred thousand percent.

1653
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:49,150
Is Badal still there?

1654
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:50,600
How's it going with him?

1655
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:52,930
You didn't give him enough credit.

1656
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:56,230
Now I know why he has never lost a case.

1657
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:21,470
He earned my trust enough
to tell him everything.

1658
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,720
How do you feel?

1659
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:24,400
Like someone saved me from drowning.

1660
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:29,360
And what was he saying
about the new witness?

1661
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,530
Never mind.

1662
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:33,900
What was that, Naina?

1663
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,400
I don't know, the pen did it.

1664
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:40,270
What pen?

1665
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,640
Badal's...

1666
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:45,020
Just a minute. I think Badal's back.

1667
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:49,560
Mr. Gupta, you're back already?

1668
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,530
-Naina Sethi?
-Yeah?

1669
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,600
Badal Gupta.

1670
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:59,110
Your lawyer, Jimmy Punjabi
has sent me here.

1671
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,860
-You're Badal Gupta?
-Yes.

1672
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,150
Actually, I was expecting
you a little later.

1673
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,610
So, should I come back later?

1674
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:15,520
But you know,
Ms. Sethi, I need the truth.

1675
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:18,860
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1676
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:25,100
You'll have to tell me one more truth!

1677
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:27,360
-Did you kill Arjun?
-Yes.

1678
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,640
Everything happened the way you said.

1679
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:54,430
I need you to think and tell me
exactly where you dumped the car.

1680
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:58,730
-You're making a mistake, Mr. Gupta.
-I don't make mistakes.

1681
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:06,310
Please tell me.
Where is my son?

1682
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:47,140
Mahabharata was Draupadi's revenge saga.

1683
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,360
Rani set the trap...

1684
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:54,440
and you took the bait.

1685
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:00,220
She made you see the "6"...

1686
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:04,940
instead of a "9."

1687
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,810
How do you know this?

1688
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:10,610
Nobody knows Rani better than I do.

1689
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:24,070
For you, I am Dhritarashtra.

1690
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:28,190
Whatever you tell me,

1691
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:30,680
will be the truth for me.

1692
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:43,030
Whatever it is that you saw...

1693
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:44,940
you must make me see.

1694
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:49,230
Every little detail.

1695
01:51:05,690 --> 01:51:08,610
For he is a fool,
who knows only the truth...

1696
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:12,400
but not the difference,
between the lies and the truth.

1697
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:28,640
"It is not right
to seek revenge every time.

1698
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,270
But it is also not right
to forgive every time either."

1699
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,820
Hello. Police?
