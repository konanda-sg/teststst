1
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:35,723
"Make all your decisions now."

2
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:38,611
"Pacify the ones
who are upset right now."

3
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,284
"Make all your decisions now."

4
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,819
"Pacify the ones
who are upset right now."

5
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:47,069
"Make all your decisions now."

6
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:49,444
"Pacify the ones
who are upset right now."

7
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:52,403
"If someone needs to be thrashed,
tell me now."

8
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:55,111
"Tell me if someone has to be
ousted from home."

9
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:56,861
"Make me do what you need to, now."

10
00:01:56,944 --> 00:02:00,819
"Don't complain later
that nothing was done."

11
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:03,861
"I'm brave
and courageous today."

12
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:06,444
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

13
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:09,569
"I'm brave and courageous today."

14
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:12,069
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

15
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:15,528
"We'll see."

16
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:20,861
"Live life to the fullest.
Leave no stone unturned."

17
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:23,486
"We'll live like kings all night."

18
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,361
"Live life to the fullest.
Leave no stone unturned."

19
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,028
"We'll live like kings all night."

20
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:32,153
"Don't stop drinking."

21
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,944
"Let's do bottoms up."

22
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:37,444
"Seeing our glasses clinking"

23
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:40,236
"your father will be furious."

24
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,444
"I'm brave and courageous today."

25
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:45,903
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

26
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:49,069
"I'm brave and courageous today."

27
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,569
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

28
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:54,736
"I don't know about tomorrow."

29
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:58,153
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

30
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:00,278
"Check this out."

31
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:10,861
"Life is beautiful,
you won't get another one."

32
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:13,611
"Don't waste it."

33
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,486
"When someone smiles at me,
I become theirs."

34
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:19,694
"There's no stopping then."

35
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:22,611
"Forget your worries."

36
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,403
"The youth is short-lived.
You'll lose it."

37
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:28,486
"I'm brave and courageous today."

38
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,069
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

39
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:34,153
"I'm brave and courageous today."

40
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,778
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

41
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:39,944
"I don't know about tomorrow."

42
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:43,361
"I don't know about tomorrow.
We'll see."

43
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:56,361
"I don't stop."

44
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,069
Yes? Where are you coming from?

45
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,819
I've come from work, where else?

46
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:03,778
Are you drunk?

47
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:06,653
Are you crazy? You think so?

48
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:07,653
Yes.

49
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,403
I'm not drunk. Smell my mouth.

50
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,278
Come here. Come on.

51
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:16,361
- Will you really smell it?
- Yes, come.

52
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,819
- Don't you believe your dad?
- No, come.

53
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,153
I'll come then.

54
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:23,194
Quickly.

55
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:25,986
I'm coming.

56
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:27,819
Look, I'm walking straight.

57
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:31,569
I'm here.

58
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,569
- Release your breath.
- Can you smell it?

59
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:42,111
You're not breathing.

60
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,903
- Can you smell it now?
- Yes.

61
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:45,986
Get down in a chicken's pose.

62
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:51,278
How can I go down
in a chicken's pose?

63
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,861
- I'll do the fish pose.
- No, chicken pose.

64
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,736
- Fish.
- No, chicken.

65
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,653
Fish.

66
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:05,694
Hello?

67
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:11,319
He seems more like my father
than my son.

68
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,153
May I come in, sir?

69
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:26,653
This is great. You got angry
and came upstairs.

70
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:29,778
You know, I did the hen pose
by mistake.

71
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:31,278
You're lying.

72
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:33,486
I even laid a few eggs downstairs.

73
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,736
- You laid eggs?
- Of course.

74
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:36,944
Okay, never mind.

75
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:39,403
We'll make omelette
out of them, tomorrow.

76
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,819
Okay, then. Okay.

77
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,569
I'm sorry and I promise

78
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,194
I won't even drink once a month
from here on.

79
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:51,278
Connection promise?

80
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,403
- Connection promise.
- Okay.

81
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:54,319
Kiss?

82
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:57,569
- Reading time?
- Yes, reading time.

83
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,903
Is it your turn or mine?

84
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,486
Okay, you read.
I won't be able to read tonight.

85
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:05,319
Don't be ridiculous, Stagnus.

86
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,861
How could you possible
know an Avox? Snaps Affy.

87
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:12,569
The very thought what's an Avox,
I asked stupidly.

88
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:29,111
What a good day today!
What good vibes! Right?

89
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:29,986
Yeah.

90
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,319
- I have a surprise for you.
- What?

91
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:36,028
We're going to meet your new
mom this evening. Yes!

92
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:37,611
What kind of surprise is this?

93
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:38,653
I don't want to go.

94
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:40,111
What's your problem?

95
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,069
Don't you feel
like having a complete family?

96
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:46,694
When we wake up in the morning our
pancakes would be waiting for us.

97
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,653
I don't feel so.
That's what you want.

98
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,944
- Only I feel that way?
- Yes.

99
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:53,111
But you do want little siblings!
I know!

100
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,236
You want someone to play with.
I know, bro.

101
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:56,986
- Got you!
- No.

102
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,944
I just want you.

103
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:02,153
Oh, love you too, bro!
But I'm not going away from you.

104
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:06,028
What if I bring you
a mom who's a foreigner?

105
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,569
- A foreigner?
- Oh, yes.

106
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:10,819
I've had enough of Indians.

107
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,611
Let's have some pasta with 'paratha'.

108
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,028
You know, cross culture!

109
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,361
Just imagine, lasagna along with
radish 'parathas'.

110
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,319
- Radish 'parathas'?
- Yeah, man.

111
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,111
Oh, come on! It's not eww.

112
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:23,903
Now you're going to get
a foreigner mom.

113
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:26,861
Study well.

114
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,403
- Okay, Dad.
- Hey!

115
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,403
I've told you to call me brother
when we're outside.

116
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:33,528
- Call me dad at home.
- Sorry, brother.

117
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:34,694
It's okay, brother.

118
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:36,611
- Hi, John.
- Hi, buddy.

119
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:38,611
Did you play the game yesterday?

120
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:40,569
Bye, younger brother Honsla!

121
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:42,194
Good day, honey!

122
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:43,986
I'm also going to college.

123
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:46,153
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, mom.

124
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,361
See you later.

125
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,153
You're looking red today.

126
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:50,986
Come on.

127
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:52,153
Hi, hello.

128
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:53,944
I'm Honsla's brother.

129
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:04,528
- Hello.
- Greetings, brother.

130
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:05,736
Greetings, brother.

131
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:09,236
- Greetings, brother.
- Greetings, brother.

132
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,569
Greetings, brother.

133
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:14,069
Come.

134
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:17,231
- We'll have to change the staff.
- Why?

135
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:18,674
Why are they calling me brother?

136
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,444
Call me Yanky or sir at work.

137
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:26,028
Anyhow, pack some
'Chamcham' and 'Gajrela' for me.

138
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:27,319
I see!

139
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,778
This means you're visiting
a girl's house again.

140
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,694
I'll have to handle
the restaurant again today.

141
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:32,903
That's what you've been hired for.

142
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:34,736
And everything's set.
What's there to handle?

143
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,028
You always take sweets
but your marriage never gets fixed.

144
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,111
But the restaurant is
making money, right?

145
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:43,528
Especially for you guys.

146
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:44,569
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

147
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,361
- Have some tea.
- Oh, yes.

148
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,444
- You have a beautiful son.
- Oh, thank you.

149
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,778
Did you greet your grandparents?

150
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,028
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

151
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:59,444
If you like her,
show me a thumbs up.

152
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:00,611
Okay.

153
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,403
Beth, dear, why don't you
call Nicky down?

154
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,528
Nicky, darling, come on down.

155
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:08,403
Nicky!

156
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:17,361
Oh, here she comes.

157
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,944
Nicky, look, this gentleman has
brought you some Indian sweet.

158
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,361
Oh, wow. Exciting.

159
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:01,569
'Chamcham'! I love 'Chamcham'!

160
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,569
This is so good.

161
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,653
This is my favourite. Wow!

162
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:26,944
Hold on...

163
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,153
The chair won't be able
to take the weight.

164
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:38,194
Not funny!

165
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,236
How could you even think
that she'd be your mom?

166
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:47,236
- What did she lack?
- She lacked nothing.

167
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,611
In fact, she was too much.

168
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:50,903
People's wives walk with elegance.

169
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:52,611
She'd have stomped.

170
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:55,736
Come on, man! I got away, bro.

171
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,444
I have one more surprise
for you, buddy.

172
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:09,444
What?

173
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,569
We're going to Calgary tomorrow to
meet your new mom, by flight, bro.

174
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:14,903
Come on!

175
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:19,111
Dad, you've ruined my weekend
while trying to find me a new mom.

176
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:21,069
Get her photo first then we'll go.

177
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,653
I've seen her picture.

178
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,319
We just have to go
and give our consent.

179
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:26,944
Oh my God! What a good day today!

180
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:28,736
There are good vibes coming, right?

181
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:44,153
- I prefer window seat.
- Okay, perfect.

182
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,694
Let him be, he'll sit on my lap.

183
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,361
- Smile now.
- Here's your passport.

184
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,486
Thank you.

185
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:53,194
Smile now.

186
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,694
Not everyone gets
the opportunity to meet a new mom.

187
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:59,736
- Attention, please.
- Hey! Hello!

188
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,111
From Vancouver to Calgary
has been dealyed.

189
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,319
What did she say?

190
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,694
The flight
is delayed by five hours.

191
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,486
To heck with them!

192
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:09,653
It's a two hour journey
and it's delayed by five hours.

193
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:10,986
Yes.

194
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:12,694
The girl's family will refuse.

195
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,778
They'll call me unprofessional.

196
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:16,069
Oh, no!

197
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:18,944
Dad! Dad!

198
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,778
Dad, look. Cross culture.

199
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,778
- Cross culture.
- Who?

200
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:23,653
- See!
- Where?

201
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:26,319
Oh, my God!
Mermaids on earth!

202
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:27,569
Back off.

203
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,153
I think it'll work out this time.

204
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:35,236
God always does the right thing.

205
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,153
Wait and watch what happens now.

206
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:38,069
Back off.

207
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:14,986
What are you laughing at?

208
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:18,194
Anyway, they don't know my worth.

209
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:22,736
- The next one will be a super woman.
- Yes, of course.

210
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,528
Turn left...

211
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:36,819
- What are you doing? Turn left.
- I'm doing it.

212
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:37,861
Turn left...

213
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:41,944
I lost because you kept talking.

214
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,069
- It's my turn now.
- What?

215
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,569
- My turn?
- No, play on your phone.

216
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,319
My phone's battery is dead.
Give me.

217
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:50,403
- Charge it.
- I forgot the charger at home.

218
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:53,694
- Where are you going?
- To the washroom.

219
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:55,778
I know what you want to do.

220
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,528
You want to play
your game on the toilet.

221
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,819
- Do you have an iPhone charger?
- No.

222
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,944
- Ma'am, can you take care of my bag?
- No.

223
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:13,736
You're useless.

224
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:19,069
Okay, Katie's going to
work this day... Okay.

225
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:21,069
Excuse me. Do you have
an iPhone charger?

226
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:23,194
I don't think so. Let me check.

227
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:24,569
Please.

228
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:37,694
No.

229
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:39,528
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:42,403
- This is a bad day.
- What did you say?

231
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:44,444
I didn't abuse you.
I'm talking to myself.

232
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:45,486
Thank you.

233
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:04,236
Excuse me, guys. Do you have
an iPhone charger?

234
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,778
- No.
- No.

235
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,361
- No, sorry.
- Alright!

236
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:13,069
- Please...
- Five hours.

237
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:14,819
He's been playing
his games alone.

238
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:19,736
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you have an iPhone charger?

239
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:21,986
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!

240
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:29,430
Sister! Sister, you forgot your bag.

241
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:32,903
Sister! Sister, you forgot your purse.

242
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,111
Sister! Sister!

243
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:38,361
You forgot your purse, sister.

244
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,008
Who are you calling sister?

245
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,216
- You want some coffee?
- No.

246
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:25,258
Okay.

247
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:34,841
- You want ice cream?
- No.

248
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:41,175
It's been five years.
You still remember?

249
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,175
I remember everything.

250
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,466
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

251
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,383
- Happy anniversary, darling.
- Same to you, baby.

252
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:00,258
I didn't realise
how this year went by.

253
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:07,550
These babies ruined my romance
with all their crying.

254
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,800
Excuse me, sir.

255
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,841
Can you please make your baby quiet?

256
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,925
Yes.

257
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:16,508
Your baby is ruining my baby's romance.

258
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:20,633
- So, where were we?
- You know what?

259
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:22,758
We'll never have babies.

260
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:27,008
We'll both fulfill our dreams together.

261
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,341
We'll make a career. We'll study.

262
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,133
Whatever makes you happy
makes me happy.

263
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,383
I told you I didn't want a baby.

264
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,883
Sweety, this is a natural process.

265
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,008
Everyone does it.
We did it too.

266
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,383
And this baby shower outside
must be your natural process too, right?

267
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:51,925
I did it to cheer you up.
So you could be happy.

268
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,758
What will I do with
the baby shower?

269
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:55,300
What do I do?

270
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:58,175
Nothing looks good on me.
How will I go out?

271
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:01,175
And look at what you're wearing.
It's such a boring colour.

272
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,591
Should I wear a 'Lehenga'?
Will that make you happy?

273
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,675
You want to see me happy, right?

274
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,758
I don't want a child.

275
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,787
Sweety, I took you
to the doctor, didn't I?

276
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,521
The doctor said an abortion
would be complicated.

277
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,011
Oh God!

278
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,053
- Sweetu...
- What happened, dear?

279
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,466
Sweety looks angry.

280
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:23,800
No, Aunt...

281
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,550
Sweety didn't like the ice cream.

282
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,716
There's a lot of ice cream outside.
Come and eat there.

283
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,050
Everyone's waiting for you.

284
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:32,175
- Yes, we're coming.
- Come on, come fast.

285
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:36,800
I know you're having mood swings.

286
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:38,966
But everyone's waiting outside.

287
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,654
It's embarrassing.

288
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:44,771
Please.

289
00:20:56,261 --> 00:21:01,386
"No one's as beautiful as you."

290
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:08,095
"No one throws tantrums
like you do."

291
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,553
"While handling your tantrums"

292
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:19,845
"I might lose myself."

293
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:27,011
"Your eyes intoxicate me
like alcohol."

294
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:29,970
"She doesn't even call me."

295
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,636
"She doesn't even call me."

296
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,553
"Your eyes intoxicate me
like alcohol."

297
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:38,095
"She doesn't even call me."

298
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:40,928
"No one can get away from that."

299
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:44,178
"No one can get away from that."

300
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,428
"We have to dance..."

301
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:49,595
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

302
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,220
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

303
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:55,011
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

304
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:59,136
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

305
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:15,845
"This Sardar has lost
his heart to you."

306
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:20,136
"I can give my life
to see you dance."

307
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,803
"I can give my life."

308
00:22:22,928 --> 00:22:25,845
"This Sardar has lost
his heart to you."

309
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,470
"I can give my life
to see you dance."

310
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:31,470
"You can guess how crazy I am."

311
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:34,303
"You can guess how crazy I am."

312
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:36,761
"We have to dance..."

313
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,595
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

314
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,470
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

315
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:46,845
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

316
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:03,178
"Let the cheques be encashed."

317
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:09,678
"You can't avoid dancing with me."

318
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,386
"Let the cheques be encashed."

319
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:16,095
"You can't avoid dancing with me."

320
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:19,011
"The world gets happy
to see us together."

321
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,470
"To see us together..."

322
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:24,511
"The world gets happy
to see us together."

323
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,136
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

324
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,053
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

325
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:34,386
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

326
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:38,428
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

327
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:42,678
"We have to dance.
Why dance alone?"

328
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,007
Sweety, you're over-thinking.

329
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:48,174
It's just four months
and then we'll have fun.

330
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,132
You have no idea what people
were saying at the baby shower.

331
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:52,424
What did they say?

332
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,549
They said I should
stay at home now.

333
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:57,549
Now I should think about
the child's studies, not mine.

334
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,174
- Who said that rubbish?
- Pammi and Dolly.

335
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,257
To heck with Pammi and Dolly.

336
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:03,966
I'm angry at you, Sweety.

337
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:06,716
You didn't make good friends
who'd give you good advice.

338
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:08,132
Let me talk to Pammi and Dolly.

339
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:10,174
- I'll teach them a lesson.
- No.

340
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,257
You're...

341
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:14,632
A person could lose his mind.

342
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:17,007
This is a natural process.
Go to sleep.

343
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:22,507
I wonder what's wrong
with Sweety these days.

344
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:24,216
She fights with me over
trivial things.

345
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,924
All this happens during pregnancy.

346
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,299
Even if she's not sweet to you,
you be sweet to her.

347
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:33,632
Be patient.

348
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:35,091
Yes.

349
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:41,757
- Bye, Sweety.
- Are you going to work?

350
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:45,299
- Yes, why?
- Nothing. Go.

351
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:48,549
Go, get lost!

352
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:52,091
You don't care about me!

353
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:54,716
Sweety, who am I working
double shifts for?

354
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,049
For whom?
Tell me, who are you doing it for?

355
00:24:57,174 --> 00:25:00,799
Obviously, for you.
For the future of our child.

356
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,507
You care about the future
of our child.

357
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:05,174
You don't care about me!

358
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,216
I'm lying at home all day long!

359
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,632
No one even offers me tea.

360
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:12,299
Listen, Sweety,
can I get you a camper?

361
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:14,424
I'll fill a bucket of water
for you here.

362
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,966
Am I a cow? Why would
I drink water from a bucket?

363
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:18,132
I didn't mean it literally.

364
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:21,132
Sweety, you're misunderstanding
everything.

365
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:23,091
- Sweety, listen to me.
- What?

366
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:25,924
Look, Sweety, your future
won't be spoilt.

367
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,299
We'll fulfil all your dreams
together, Sweety.

368
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,049
Okay, then, if you think so,
then I'll give the baby to you.

369
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:34,841
- Will you take care of him?
- Sweety, control.

370
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,924
Will you take care of him? Tell me.

371
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,132
We'll take care of him together, Sweety.
What are you saying?

372
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,049
We'll take care of him together.

373
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,382
Move away.

374
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:50,341
Yes, Mrs. Singh. Tell me
what your problem is with him.

375
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,091
I want a divorce from him.

376
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,382
Please.

377
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:00,299
She's having mood swings.

378
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:03,841
She even hit me yesterday.

379
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:05,924
This is how she is.

380
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:08,591
When she has a headache
she think it's stomach ache.

381
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,841
When I ask her what's hurting

382
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:12,966
she says, "if you love me,
figure it out."

383
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:14,507
Tell me. You...

384
00:26:14,632 --> 00:26:17,716
We don't want any divorce.
Let's wrap this up.

385
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:21,007
Don't listen to him.
He's a cunning man.

386
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:25,174
I loved him and this is
what he did to me.

387
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:27,424
This is my love.

388
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:29,424
And this is God's blessing,
you know it.

389
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:32,966
When God has given us a gift,
we'll take care of it together.

390
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,382
I take care of the baby all day.

391
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,299
What do you do for him?

392
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:40,091
Let the baby be born first
then you can take care of him.

393
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:43,132
Whenever I'm leaving for work,
I see her sulking on the sofa.

394
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:46,382
When I come back, she's still
sulking on the same sofa.

395
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:49,216
She eats ice cream all day.
She'll turn into a whale, ma'am.

396
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,341
- Excuse me, Mr. Singh. Please.
- Sorry, ma'am.

397
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:54,466
I had my dreams, career
and studies.

398
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,174
He didn't let me do anything.

399
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,841
Ma'am, ask her about her dream.
Ask her what she wants to become.

400
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:00,674
Sir, please ask her.

401
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,216
What were your dreams, Mrs. Singh?

402
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:05,049
My dream was to be
an astronaut in NASA.

403
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:06,466
- I see!
- I want to ride a rocket.

404
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,466
Did you hear that?
She wants to ride a rocket.

405
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:12,882
Ma'am, her dream is to roam
the universe.

406
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,924
She'd have gotten down somewhere.

407
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:17,966
- I had backup too.
- Look at her.

408
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:21,174
If I hadn't become
an astronaut in NASA

409
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,132
I'd have become a fashion designer.

410
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:26,091
You should ride a rocket.
It's automatic. You can do it.

411
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:28,507
He keeps mocking me all day.

412
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:30,507
I'll tell you what

413
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:34,132
get me the divorce and let him have
the child's custody.

414
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:35,799
I can't take care
of the baby alone, sir.

415
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:37,966
I can't either. Hear me out.

416
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,466
You have to take care of the baby.

417
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,216
Sir, a father can't take care of
a baby on his own.

418
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:42,299
Look, Mr. Singh

419
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:45,632
if the mother doesn't want the baby
you can't force her.

420
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:48,216
- Ma'am, no one can force me either.
- You will take care of him.

421
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:49,466
Calm down, guys.

422
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,757
We will file your divorce papers.

423
00:27:51,924 --> 00:27:55,549
The judge will decide who gets
the baby's custody.

424
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:58,924
Are your dreams fulfilled?

425
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:00,216
Yes.

426
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:02,466
You want to see something?

427
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,174
Look at this.

428
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,924
My designs get published
in magazines.

429
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,757
The package is good too.

430
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:11,882
Take a look.

431
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:18,257
Your back-up plan worked?

432
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:19,966
Yes.

433
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:22,966
What about your restaurant?

434
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,424
Did you open one,
or were you just boasting?

435
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:29,924
Go ask anyone whose Raj Kachori
'gol gappas' are famous.

436
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,841
They'll tell you about my restaurant.

437
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:32,924
That's great.

438
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:37,257
- Here's your coffee and your ice cream.
- Thank you.

439
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,549
You're a lucky man.
You have a beautiful wife.

440
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,966
Dear, we regret that Sweety left.

441
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:47,424
She left me six months ago, Dad.

442
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,257
Yes, my child.

443
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:51,174
But all couples fight, Mom.

444
00:28:51,591 --> 00:28:53,299
Uncle and aunt fight all the time.

445
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,216
My child!

446
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:56,882
You grow with age.
Look how calm they are now.

447
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:58,841
What's the poor girl's fault?

448
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:00,632
She had big dreams.

449
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:02,674
Let her fulfil her big dreams.

450
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:04,966
I'll live alone.

451
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,466
You're not alone, dear.

452
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:09,216
You have a son to take care of.

453
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:12,299
We're both working.

454
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:13,841
We can't watch him.

455
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:15,507
You have to take care of him, dear.

456
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:18,382
But daddy, I'm working too.
How will I take care of him?

457
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,049
I can't even hold him properly.

458
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:22,841
You can do it, dear.
Be patient.

459
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:26,757
You must be patient now, dear.

460
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:27,924
Mom?

461
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:41,674
"Men don't take tensions.
They work things out."

462
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:58,507
Hey, what's that you're carrying?

463
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,382
My in-laws asked me to be patient.

464
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,299
Are you going to raise it alone?

465
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:06,216
Yes.

466
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:07,466
What's his name?

467
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:11,007
Honsla.

468
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:15,216
"Be patient. Be patient."

469
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:18,757
"Be patient. Be patient."

470
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:20,966
"Be patient."

471
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:22,966
"Hey, yo, play that again."

472
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,591
You want water?

473
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:37,257
Are you hungry?
You must be hungry.

474
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:40,091
My in-laws have given me
a hungry child.

475
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,882
"Those who scare easy..."

476
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,549
Oh, look at this!

477
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,841
"Life doesn't give them
a chance."

478
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,382
This? No?

479
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,466
"Those who scare easy..."

480
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,882
"Life doesn't give them
a chance."

481
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:52,132
What the heck is this?

482
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:55,674
"It's like a gamble,
and I'm lucky."

483
00:30:57,174 --> 00:30:59,882
Okay, hold on. I'll get
your milk right away, dear.

484
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:02,257
"Be patient. Be patient."

485
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:04,757
"Be patient. Be patient."

486
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:07,882
"Be patient."

487
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,674
"Just move on, brother."

488
00:31:19,674 --> 00:31:22,424
"Just be relaxed."

489
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:25,174
"Just move on, brother.

490
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:27,007
"Just be relaxed."

491
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:30,549
"Don't panic. You can do this."

492
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:31,924
Oh, God!

493
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:36,591
"Be patient. Be patient."

494
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:40,132
"Be patient. Be patient."

495
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:43,924
"Be patient. Be patient."

496
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,424
"Be patient, brother."

497
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:28,299
"Hey, yo, play that again."

498
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:05,966
Honsla.

499
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:12,299
Honsla.

500
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:15,716
Honsla.

501
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:28,174
- Oh no!
-"Be patient. Be patient."

502
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:32,007
"Be patient. Be patient."

503
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:34,841
"Be patient, brother."

504
00:33:34,924 --> 00:33:36,424
Yes, dear. Yes.

505
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:40,299
You don't even eat.
How do you poop so much?

506
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:43,549
Yes, right away.
Oh, look at this.

507
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:47,466
We've run out of nappies, dear.

508
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:49,966
Wait, I'm coming. Wait.

509
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,507
Don't move, I'm coming.

510
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:04,299
"Men don't take tensions.
They work things out."

511
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:06,591
Right. Left. Center

512
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:09,966
"Be patient. Be patient."

513
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:14,341
-Yes!
-"Be patient. Be patient."

514
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:16,799
"Be patient."

515
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:23,424
Let me go. I'm a human being.

516
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:26,591
"Hey, yo, play that again."

517
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:37,132
"Those who scare easy..."

518
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:40,632
"Life doesn't give them
a chance."

519
00:34:41,174 --> 00:34:43,216
"Those who scare easy..."

520
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,924
"Life doesn't give them
a chance."

521
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:49,841
"It's like a gamble,
and I'm lucky."

522
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:54,466
"Be patient. Be patient."

523
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:58,174
"Be patient. Be patient."

524
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:00,466
Hey, my baby!

525
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:04,757
Where should I leave you?

526
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:25,132
Aunt!

527
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,049
Hello, aunt?

528
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:31,716
Aunt, what happened?

529
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:33,632
I fell in the bathroom.

530
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,924
- Aunt, I wanted to know if...
- Pass me that water.

531
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:39,132
Keep it here. I need to take my medicine.

532
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:42,799
This medicine.

533
00:35:44,382 --> 00:35:45,757
Keep it here.

534
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:49,341
- Okay.
- Aunt, just for a day, could you...

535
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:51,507
I've washed the clothes.

536
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:53,799
Put them in the dryer.

537
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:56,257
- Okay.
- And listen.

538
00:35:56,382 --> 00:35:58,924
I've chopped the vegetables.
They need to be cooked.

539
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:00,341
- Aunt, I'm getting late.
- Listen...

540
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:01,966
- I'll order food from the
restaurant, aunt. - Listen...

541
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:02,966
Okay.

542
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:05,341
I wonder what games
she plays in the bathroom.

543
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:16,424
He was dancing so terrible.

544
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,507
- Sir, 'Chicken Toofani'.
- Wow!

545
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,132
Wow! Marvelous!

546
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:42,757
Awesome! He's so good!
He's amazing.

547
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:45,632
Sir, continue with
'Chicken Toofani'. Ma'am, please.

548
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,841
Yes, fantabulous.

549
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:56,632
Honsla.

550
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:01,049
Hello ma'am. Hello sir.

551
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:07,799
Where are you going?

552
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:16,966
Hello.

553
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,507
You're all messed up, silly.

554
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,132
Come on.

555
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:53,174
Yes, so, anyway...

556
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:56,966
Yes, I'll just get it.

557
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:10,091
Yeah.

558
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:16,716
It was fun.

559
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:19,507
Oh my God!

560
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,007
Oh my God!

561
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,549
Oh my God!

562
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:26,132
Get out, you are fired.

563
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:29,049
- Who'll hire you?
- Slowly.

564
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,049
- Hold this.
- Bro..

565
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:32,716
He's just gone to sleep.

566
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:34,882
Find me a job which
I can do with the baby.

567
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:35,924
Okay.

568
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:38,924
- What kind of job...
- Please talk softly, he's sleeping.

569
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:43,757
What kind of job would allow you
to take your baby along?

570
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:46,799
I'll tell you what, become a janitor.

571
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:50,091
Considering my current situation,
I can even become a sweeper.

572
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,382
If your wife had left you,
you'd have known.

573
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:54,424
- What?
- Nonsense!

574
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:57,174
I think you should remarry.

575
00:38:57,549 --> 00:38:58,632
Get it over with.

576
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:00,382
You want me to remarry?

577
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,882
I better take care of him instead.
At least no one will leave me.

578
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,507
Can't you speak softly?

579
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:09,466
- I didn't even say anything.
- Eat.

580
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:41,405
Didn't you ever miss us?

581
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:44,863
I did, a lot.

582
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:48,905
But I didn't have the courage
to come back.

583
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Did you get married?

584
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:57,488
I tried.

585
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:11,655
Name, Yanky Singh.

586
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:12,738
Age...

587
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,696
22? No, 26.

588
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:21,405
Sex, male. What else?

589
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:23,405
Marital status? No.

590
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,155
Baby? Yes.

591
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,696
I'm not married
but I have a baby.

592
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:33,280
This doesn't sound right.

593
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:42,446
Okay, I'll explain later.

594
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:44,155
Baby, no.

595
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,905
- Nittu!
- Yes, Yanky?

596
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,280
It's your off. Why don't
you baby-sit for two hours?

597
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:54,946
It's not my off. I'm at work.

598
00:40:55,071 --> 00:40:56,405
Make an excuse.

599
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,113
What excuse? This isn't Punjab

600
00:40:59,238 --> 00:41:01,530
where I can say that I want to go home
as my uncle passed away.

601
00:41:01,655 --> 00:41:03,363
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

602
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,655
You never help me.

603
00:41:09,363 --> 00:41:10,696
My aunt isn't dead.

604
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:14,196
She must be fine now. Yes, she is.

605
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:21,905
Is she dead?

606
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:39,238
Where is she?

607
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:44,405
Hi!

608
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:52,113
Excuse me.
Sorry, a bit late.

609
00:41:57,988 --> 00:42:01,238
- Is that your baby?
- Babies belong to God.

610
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:03,321
Open the lid.

611
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,113
- It's time for his milk.
- What?

612
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:07,613
If he starts crying,
he won't let us talk.

613
00:42:08,238 --> 00:42:11,571
Open the box, and add one scoop

614
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,863
- then two scoops.
- Oh my God!

615
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:15,363
That's it. Not a third one.

616
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:17,196
If I add three scoops, he poops.

617
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,613
Disgusting.

618
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,571
Let's add some hot water to it.

619
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:22,030
This is a good day.

620
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:24,613
It doesn't feel like
this is our first meeting.

621
00:42:24,821 --> 00:42:26,571
I feel like we've know each other
for ages.

622
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,905
I get such good vibes from you.

623
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Let's mix this.

624
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:31,238
Dissolve.

625
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:32,196
Just a second.

626
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:38,655
So, tell me, when are we
getting married?

627
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,488
Whose baby is this?

628
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:42,280
You can consider him your own.

629
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:43,946
Are you out of your mind?

630
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:47,821
You really think I'd marry someone
who has a child?

631
00:42:47,988 --> 00:42:49,780
Did you tell me you had a child?

632
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:51,238
No, but I didn't hide it either.

633
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,238
This is not going to work out.

634
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,530
Oh my God! Holy!

635
00:42:56,113 --> 00:42:57,655
Good luck with you and your baby.

636
00:42:58,405 --> 00:42:59,280
Okay, thank you.

637
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:05,113
Excuse me. Hello.

638
00:43:06,405 --> 00:43:07,571
It's such a nice day.

639
00:43:08,738 --> 00:43:10,613
It doesn't feel like
it's our first meeting.

640
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,696
The world fears babies so much?

641
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,238
I'm marrying for his sake but I
can't marry because of him.

642
00:43:16,988 --> 00:43:19,946
You have a... Yes, I have a baby.

643
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:21,030
Do you have a problem with that?

644
00:43:21,155 --> 00:43:23,238
Here you are. Marry me
if you want or get lost.

645
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:30,280
She's so desperate like me.

646
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,738
I'm very happy that you have a baby.

647
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:35,696
Oh, yes.

648
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,155
Can you send me his picture?

649
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:38,113
Oh, yes.

650
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,655
As I adore... adore kids.

651
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:42,696
As I adore kids?

652
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:43,905
The first line is fine.

653
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:45,780
I'll send your photo, Honsla.

654
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:47,571
Which one? I'll send this one.

655
00:43:47,863 --> 00:43:51,863
Oh, no. I don't want to miss this
because of the darn tube.

656
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:55,238
This is fine. Take this.

657
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,530
It's such a lovely day.

658
00:44:06,655 --> 00:44:08,488
It doesn't feel like
this is our first meeting.

659
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:10,155
I get such good vibes from you.

660
00:44:10,321 --> 00:44:14,821
I think we'll be a family for ages.

661
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,363
You know, I love children.

662
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,821
I always wanted to adopt a child.

663
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:23,280
Next year, I'm starting
a charity for them.

664
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:25,530
Start two. We'll have two, not one.

665
00:44:25,655 --> 00:44:27,946
- That's wonderful.
- Oh, yes.

666
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,863
But we should get married first.

667
00:44:29,988 --> 00:44:32,071
Then we'll have to meet
my parents soon.

668
00:44:32,196 --> 00:44:33,696
- Let's meet them today.
- Right now?

669
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:35,321
Yes, we're both ready.

670
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:37,655
And the wise say that you must
not delay anything.

671
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:40,155
Yes, my dear.

672
00:44:40,571 --> 00:44:42,113
He's getting cranky.

673
00:44:42,238 --> 00:44:43,655
He won't let me have tea.

674
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:45,155
It's time for his milk.

675
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,488
Let me make his milk,
then we can talk.

676
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:50,946
Right away, son. Right away.

677
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:55,238
My son's milk is here.
Gal Gadot is here.

678
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,488
"Gal Gadot is here
with my son's milk."

679
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,530
"She's Wonder Woman.
My son will drink milk."

680
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:02,738
"Come on."

681
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:08,988
I want to talk to you.

682
00:45:09,113 --> 00:45:10,238
- Come.
- Sleep.

683
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:12,196
"Go to sleep."

684
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,988
The boy seems nice.

685
00:45:14,113 --> 00:45:16,196
Yes, dear. How are you?

686
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:18,071
Listen to me, dear.

687
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,405
The boy is married and has a child.

688
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:23,863
Your sister has two children too.

689
00:45:24,113 --> 00:45:25,488
She's divorced.

690
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:28,071
If we could get her married to him...

691
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:31,696
But Mom, he likes me.
Don't bring this up in front of him.

692
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:32,946
He'll feel bad.

693
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:35,905
We've even sworn
to be together forever.

694
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:37,696
- I think he truly loves me.
- Santosh!

695
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,988
The boy has agreed
for our elder daughter.

696
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,280
- What?
- Come.

697
00:45:44,196 --> 00:45:45,821
You want to marry my sister?

698
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:50,446
Well, he suggested that the elder
one should marry first.

699
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:53,863
So, sister is...
No, not sister.

700
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:59,238
If you can take care of three
children then I don't mind.

701
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:02,030
- But I do mind.
- Talk softly, he's sleeping.

702
00:46:02,905 --> 00:46:05,405
You don't need a wife, you need
someone to take care of your child.

703
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:07,780
Dad, I won't marry him.

704
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:09,946
She won't agree, sir.

705
00:46:10,363 --> 00:46:12,821
Let's go back to plan A.
Let me marry the younger one.

706
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:16,196
- I won't marry you. Get out.
- You'll wake my son up.

707
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:18,780
What a strange family!

708
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,405
Don't you guys get along
with each other?

709
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:30,863
Honsla, it's time
for both of us to grow.

710
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,863
You are growing up.

711
00:46:34,155 --> 00:46:35,655
I could have too.

712
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:42,321
Oh, such a cute baby!
Excuse me.

713
00:46:42,905 --> 00:46:45,696
It's such a cute baby.
Can we please click a picture with him?

714
00:46:46,155 --> 00:46:47,363
- With him?
- Yes.

715
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,238
Yes, consider him your own.

716
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:50,946
Carry him.

717
00:46:51,071 --> 00:46:52,405
- Please take our picture.
- Hi, baby!

718
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,363
Sure.

719
00:46:53,655 --> 00:46:54,696
- Carry him.
- Hi!

720
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:56,905
- The baby's so cute.
- So cute.

721
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,530
The baby is lovely.

722
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:01,196
Take our picture.

723
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,655
Yes. Yes, smile.

724
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:06,030
- Here you are.
- Yes!

725
00:47:06,738 --> 00:47:08,655
What a lovely picture!

726
00:47:08,946 --> 00:47:12,280
Let's take one more. Ma'am,
take the baby to the centre. Yes.

727
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,655
You look lovely, ma'am.

728
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,571
Here you are.

729
00:47:16,696 --> 00:47:18,988
Look! The picture is beautiful, ma'am.

730
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:21,530
- Take this. Okay, bye, ma'am.
- The baby, sir?

731
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,655
Oh, you can keep him.
It's not a big deal.

732
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,321
- Okay, goodbye.
- But the baby is yours, sir.

733
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:29,738
Babies belong to God, sir.
Look at her smile.

734
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:30,988
Look at how happy she is.

735
00:47:31,405 --> 00:47:32,238
You can keep him.

736
00:47:33,238 --> 00:47:35,488
Okay, I'll tell you what,
keep him for a year.

737
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:38,821
If you don't like him,
I'll give you a full refund.

738
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:39,946
- Yes.
- Okay?

739
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:42,405
- Good offer?
- Are you serious, sir?

740
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,655
I'm very serious, sir.
You can talk to ma'am.

741
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,988
I'll tell you what, sir.
Hold the baby for a while.

742
00:47:47,113 --> 00:47:48,988
We'll go on the side and discuss this.

743
00:47:49,113 --> 00:47:50,113
- We'll be back.
- Ma'am!

744
00:47:50,238 --> 00:47:53,488
- We'll be back.
- Ma'am, convince him.

745
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,863
Honsla, I think it's time for me
to grow too.

746
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,280
- Run...
- Why don't you discuss here, sir?

747
00:48:01,405 --> 00:48:02,488
- Where are you going?
- No, brother! Go.

748
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:05,613
Ma'am, stop sir.
Ma'am, please stop!

749
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,488
Why do you want to give the child
away for adoption?

750
00:48:10,905 --> 00:48:12,446
I'm a single parent.

751
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,280
I don't have any relatives.

752
00:48:15,363 --> 00:48:18,280
- Okay. - I can't work
or take care of the baby.

753
00:48:18,738 --> 00:48:23,280
Do you want only Punjabi parents
for him or any foster parents?

754
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:26,446
- I'd prefer Punjabi parents.
- Okay.

755
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:29,405
Well, it seems like we have
all the documents.

756
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:32,738
Whenever we find suitable parents,
we'll call you.

757
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:33,655
- Thank you.
- Yes.

758
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,946
- Thank you.
- Okay.

759
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:36,446
Yes, dear.

760
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:06,155
Hello, Mr. Yanky.

761
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:07,571
- Mr. And Mrs. Siddhu.
- Yes!

762
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:10,655
Sorry, we were so excited
that we came early.

763
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,863
No... Welcome.

764
00:49:15,613 --> 00:49:16,446
Thank you.

765
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:24,030
Look at you.

766
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:26,113
Look at how lovely he is.

767
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,696
So cute!
- Hi.

768
00:49:28,863 --> 00:49:30,905
Wow! - Oh,
you're so adorable.

769
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,238
Oh my God!

770
00:49:32,655 --> 00:49:34,155
Did you read the documents?

771
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:35,321
Yes.

772
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:37,655
- Can I make a call?
- Okay.

773
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:41,321
- How are you?
- You're so cute.

774
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:42,571
- Bring him to me.
- Hello.

775
00:49:42,696 --> 00:49:43,821
Yes.

776
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:45,571
- Nittu.
- Yes, Yanky.

777
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,530
Nittu, the family is here for Honsla.

778
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:51,113
- How do they look?
- They look great.

779
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,946
I've found out.
They're financially stable too.

780
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:54,280
That's great.

781
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:57,238
Honsla will have a good life.
You'll be set too.

782
00:49:57,613 --> 00:50:00,071
Don't think too much.
Let them take him.

783
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:02,155
Yes. Okay, bye.

784
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,113
- Look at him.
- Yes.

785
00:50:04,363 --> 00:50:06,571
- Excuse me, Mr. Yanky.
- Smile.

786
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:08,821
I need your
sign on the official documents.

787
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:11,655
- What? Sign, yes, I'll sign.
- Yes.

788
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:14,113
- Where?
- Over here.

789
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:15,321
- Okay.
- Sweetheart.

790
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:18,863
- Hi.
- Hey.

791
00:50:18,988 --> 00:50:20,530
- Hi.
- Cutie.

792
00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:21,446
Come to me.

793
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:23,696
- He's lovely.
- I know.

794
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,613
Congratulations to both parents.

795
00:50:25,738 --> 00:50:27,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

796
00:50:48,155 --> 00:50:49,071
Bye, Honsla.

797
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,488
Let's raise one
to our friend's freedom.

798
00:51:44,488 --> 00:51:47,280
Yanky, you must feel
lighter now.

799
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:50,446
Appointment.

800
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:53,280
Is it the same appointment
you spoke about?

801
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:54,780
That's the one.

802
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:57,155
But I wanted to meet my friends.

803
00:51:57,238 --> 00:51:58,238
That's why I let it go.

804
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:34,988
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

805
00:53:35,113 --> 00:53:38,530
I forgot to give you Honsla's toy.

806
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:39,488
Oh, I see.

807
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:41,446
If he cries...

808
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,238
- Hello! Excuse me.
- Honsla!

809
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:47,238
Hello?

810
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:55,780
I thought you must be married
and settled.

811
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,071
But you were doing all this
on your own?

812
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:03,155
Sweety!

813
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:05,946
Darling, our flight's boarding.
Come on, let's go.

814
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:17,655
That's my husband.
I got married last week.

815
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:41,571
Dad, who was that?

816
00:56:42,863 --> 00:56:43,696
She?

817
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:46,863
She was my girlfriend from college.

818
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,113
Sweety.

819
00:56:51,363 --> 00:56:52,613
Her husband came, so she left.

820
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:12,696
Attention, passengers.

821
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:17,321
Flight AC147 travelling from
Vancouver to Calgary

822
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:20,530
has been cancelled
due to bad weather conditions.

823
00:57:20,655 --> 00:57:21,488
Dad.

824
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:23,030
- For more information...
- Dad!

825
00:57:23,155 --> 00:57:26,780
- Our flight is cancelled.
- passengers must report...

826
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:28,905
It wasn't cancelled.
It crashed today.

827
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,821
People come and go.

828
00:57:32,655 --> 00:57:33,696
We're standing right here.

829
00:57:34,696 --> 00:57:36,613
When will our flight take off?

830
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,894
Keep this. Sit straight, Honsla.

831
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:25,894
- John's mom is getting married.
- Who's John?

832
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,436
My friend.

833
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:29,186
You should have told me
his mother was single.

834
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:30,269
I'd have married her.

835
00:58:30,394 --> 00:58:31,894
You'd both play as brothers.

836
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:34,244
His mom is 47.

837
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:35,660
If this continues, dear,

838
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,019
I won't even find older women.

839
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:40,945
Yes. I have an idea.

840
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,717
- You'll find a 25 year old.
- How?

841
00:58:44,884 --> 00:58:48,092
- Matrimonial site.
- I already have a profile there.

842
00:58:48,217 --> 00:58:49,467
Matrimonial site!

843
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,550
- When?
- When you were a baby.

844
00:58:54,009 --> 00:58:56,300
That's the difference.
I was a baby then.

845
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:59,342
Now I'll make the account
and I'll chat.

846
00:58:59,675 --> 00:59:00,925
He'll chat?

847
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,134
Hey, hold on.

848
00:59:03,092 --> 00:59:05,134
I already have a profile in it.
Don't make another one.

849
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,550
Wait and watch.

850
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,342
Full name?

851
00:59:16,425 --> 00:59:17,509
You don't know your dad's name?

852
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,634
Yanky isn't a name.

853
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:22,259
Waryam Singh.

854
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:25,092
Waryam Singh Waraich.

855
00:59:26,092 --> 00:59:28,009
Waraich? What?

856
00:59:28,175 --> 00:59:29,800
- W...
- Yanky is fine.

857
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:33,425
Age?

858
00:59:34,425 --> 00:59:37,342
- Write 27.
- 27?

859
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:38,384
So what?

860
00:59:38,717 --> 00:59:41,550
You made an account with
the age 27 six years ago.

861
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:43,717
Forget that.
What's your age now?

862
00:59:44,592 --> 00:59:46,634
Write 29. You can lie a bit.

863
00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:51,217
When you go to court to marry,
they'll check your ID.

864
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:53,009
You'll be embarrassed.

865
00:59:53,134 --> 00:59:55,259
Just write 31, or close it.
I don't want an account.

866
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,384
Let's write 32, okay.

867
00:59:58,675 --> 00:59:59,592
Okay, then.

868
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,675
Kids... No.

869
01:00:06,884 --> 01:00:08,425
What... What have you done?

870
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:11,759
I said you can lie a bit.
You're erasing evidence.

871
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,092
Dad, I know what I'm doing.

872
01:00:14,384 --> 01:00:15,300
Wait and watch.

873
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:19,384
Send a request to a nice girl.

874
01:00:19,509 --> 01:00:20,759
Yes, hold on.

875
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:23,675
She's okay. - No.
- She's okay.

876
01:00:25,425 --> 01:00:26,634
- Not bad.
- No.

877
01:00:27,134 --> 01:00:28,009
Hold on.

878
01:00:29,884 --> 01:00:30,925
Isn't she the one from the airport?

879
01:00:31,717 --> 01:00:33,050
Yes, you saw her?

880
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:36,134
Yes, I looked at her by chance.

881
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,300
- You have a sharp memory.
- I'm your father.

882
01:00:40,134 --> 01:00:42,634
- Should I send her a request?
- No, wait. What does she do?

883
01:00:43,842 --> 01:00:45,009
Yoga teacher.

884
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,384
- Yoga teacher.
- Yes.

885
01:00:49,884 --> 01:00:51,634
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

886
01:00:54,175 --> 01:00:55,050
Hey!

887
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:59,592
- Put my picture.
- Dad, curiosity.

888
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,175
I didn't know my son
was so talented.

889
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:06,384
I simply hate you, Yanky.

890
01:01:10,425 --> 01:01:11,842
But I like you.

891
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:14,259
What's your name? Jasmine.

892
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,717
Breath in.

893
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,175
And breath out.

894
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,425
Yoga is beautiful,
not just for your body

895
01:01:31,175 --> 01:01:35,634
but also your mind and soul.

896
01:01:46,092 --> 01:01:48,884
Here you are.
Your minister's gone.

897
01:01:54,134 --> 01:01:57,092
- Mom, Jasmine is here. Hurry up.
- Lie down right here.

898
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,800
- Let me make my move first.
- Come on.

899
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,717
- On the floor, mom.
- To heck with you!

900
01:02:11,092 --> 01:02:12,425
She is coming.

901
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:17,550
What happened to you, mom!
Drink water!

902
01:02:17,675 --> 01:02:19,425
I know what you're worried about.

903
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:22,175
- Jasmine's marriage.
- Take a deep breath.

904
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,342
Take a sip of water.

905
01:02:24,425 --> 01:02:26,592
Water.
- All this is due to weakness.

906
01:02:26,717 --> 01:02:29,009
You don't eat
out of worry. - I won't survive.

907
01:02:29,134 --> 01:02:30,925
No, Mother-in-law, not yet.

908
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,384
We can't send you off until you
see your granddaughter's wedding.

909
01:02:34,509 --> 01:02:37,717
Even the prayer meeting seems
dull without 'Jalebis'.

910
01:02:38,384 --> 01:02:42,759
Did you see that?
She only wants to see me dead.

911
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,092
- What's happened!
- Jasmine!

912
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:45,259
My granddaughter!

913
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,384
Hey, what happened, Jasmine?

914
01:02:49,134 --> 01:02:50,592
I can act too.

915
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:53,134
You could have acted
to marry then, dear.

916
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:55,967
You've made my profile on
the matrimonial site.

917
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:57,717
I'll even meet guys if you want me to.

918
01:02:57,842 --> 01:02:58,842
What else should I do?

919
01:02:59,967 --> 01:03:01,467
Just get married, dear.

920
01:03:01,592 --> 01:03:03,425
Why do you want to trouble
an old woman?

921
01:03:03,634 --> 01:03:05,300
Tell me what kind
of a guy you like.

922
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:07,217
Should we get him made in China?

923
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:10,009
I'll get married this year,
I promise.

924
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:12,384
Honsla!

925
01:03:14,092 --> 01:03:15,050
Honsla!

926
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,509
He's been playing games.

927
01:03:16,842 --> 01:03:18,259
I'm sure he hasn't checked.

928
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,509
How are you, dear?

929
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:23,759
Hit that car.

930
01:03:24,925 --> 01:03:26,009
Was there any reply from there?

931
01:03:27,509 --> 01:03:30,092
There was no reply yet.

932
01:03:30,717 --> 01:03:32,884
- She will. Be patient.
- Yes.

933
01:03:34,925 --> 01:03:36,592
Anyway, charge this.
Make sure the battery doesn't die.

934
01:03:51,425 --> 01:03:54,342
Relax, Romeo.
Let me sleep at night.

935
01:03:56,009 --> 01:03:57,509
You have to go to work
in the morning.

936
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:13,967
Accepted!

937
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,967
Dad! Dad! Dad!

938
01:04:22,717 --> 01:04:23,634
Dad!

939
01:04:25,175 --> 01:04:26,259
Dad!

940
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:30,925
Accepted.

941
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:01,967
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

942
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:03,509
I'm going to bring you
a mother in a week.

943
01:05:03,634 --> 01:05:04,925
Give me the phone.
Let me start chatting.

944
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,634
I made your ID. I'll chat.

945
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:09,509
No, dear, you go to school.
Children don't do this.

946
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:10,592
- Give me the phone.
- I'm not going to school.

947
01:05:10,717 --> 01:05:12,342
- I'll chat.
- I'll chat.

948
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:13,967
- I'll chat.
- I'll chat.

949
01:05:14,092 --> 01:05:15,384
- I'll chat.
- I'll chat.

950
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:16,675
- I'll chat.
- Hey!

951
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,759
- She'll reject you if you chat.
- Don't underestimate your dad.

952
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:22,967
Trust me.

953
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,300
"My beloved will come today."

954
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,592
I'm telling you for the last time,
let me chat.

955
01:05:32,092 --> 01:05:34,884
Dear, go and study in school.

956
01:05:35,092 --> 01:05:38,092
Take your bag and
concentrate on your studies.

957
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:39,300
Hey, John.

958
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:41,759
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetheart.

959
01:05:41,967 --> 01:05:43,634
Bye, honey younger brother.

960
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:45,300
Bye, dad.

961
01:05:47,759 --> 01:05:49,384
I'll do my homework, dad.

962
01:05:49,509 --> 01:05:52,134
- Bye, dad. Love you.
- I'll see you at home.

963
01:05:52,425 --> 01:05:55,634
- See you later, dad. Bye.
- Congrats, John's mom.

964
01:05:56,967 --> 01:05:58,175
You did it!

965
01:05:59,509 --> 01:06:00,342
Let's go, sweetheart.

966
01:06:02,634 --> 01:06:05,384
What's he afraid of?
I'm just like you.

967
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:10,925
What should I write?

968
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,425
Hello...

969
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:14,425
Hello, gorgeous. Yes.

970
01:06:15,134 --> 01:06:17,259
Hello, gorgeous.
How are you?

971
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,050
Oh, the gorgeous is online.

972
01:06:30,592 --> 01:06:31,467
How am I?

973
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:36,384
You're asking how the leaves
are doing in autumn?

974
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:39,967
You do this on purpose, don't you?

975
01:06:46,384 --> 01:06:48,759
Means? Means...

976
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:55,134
Asking the condition of leaves
in spring.

977
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:57,009
Purposely? Purposely?

978
01:07:05,259 --> 01:07:06,134
Where did she go?

979
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,509
Never mind she didn't get it.
I'll send her a poem.

980
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:13,134
You're like the leaves
of pomegranates.

981
01:07:15,134 --> 01:07:18,592
It's monsoon,
why don't you embrace me?

982
01:07:19,217 --> 01:07:20,009
Take this.

983
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:21,842
She replied. Means?

984
01:07:22,092 --> 01:07:23,884
She always asking the meaning.

985
01:07:24,009 --> 01:07:25,050
Means...

986
01:07:26,384 --> 01:07:28,759
Two leaves of pomegranate...

987
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:33,425
In the rainy weather hug me,
beloved. Take this.

988
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:37,800
Smiley, smiley, two hearts,
two hearts, take this.

989
01:07:37,925 --> 01:07:38,925
All the hearts for you.

990
01:07:39,675 --> 01:07:41,134
Take a kiss also.

991
01:07:57,899 --> 01:07:59,441
Dad! Dad!

992
01:07:59,566 --> 01:08:01,107
Dad! Dad!

993
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:04,625
What happened?

994
01:08:06,884 --> 01:08:09,217
Dad, did you chat with her?
What did she say?

995
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:12,134
What happened to the belt?

996
01:08:13,509 --> 01:08:14,842
Tell me, did you chat?

997
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:18,342
- How was your day?
- It was fine, Dad. Did you chat?

998
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:20,759
Should we go to McDonald's?

999
01:08:21,647 --> 01:08:23,480
Dad, don't go off topic.

1000
01:08:24,175 --> 01:08:25,884
Tell me. What happened?

1001
01:08:29,134 --> 01:08:30,217
She blocked me.

1002
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:33,634
She blocked you!
What did she ask?

1003
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:36,884
She asked why I didn't
have a display picture.

1004
01:08:37,342 --> 01:08:40,467
I told her if she saw my picture,
she'd lose her sleep.

1005
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:42,634
What else?

1006
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:46,217
She wasn't interested.

1007
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,842
Wow, dad!

1008
01:08:49,342 --> 01:08:50,759
I knew this would happen.

1009
01:08:51,342 --> 01:08:54,175
You never listen.
You always rush things.

1010
01:08:56,092 --> 01:08:57,009
I'm sorry.

1011
01:09:09,467 --> 01:09:10,509
What do we do now?

1012
01:09:11,342 --> 01:09:13,550
What else?
We'll have to find a new one.

1013
01:09:15,342 --> 01:09:16,842
We'll look for a new one but

1014
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:20,717
I'd be really happy
if we could have this one.

1015
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,425
Will you impress her if you
meet her face to face?

1016
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,342
Face to face?

1017
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:29,884
She hasn't even seen me yet.

1018
01:09:30,009 --> 01:09:32,592
If we had met face to face,
she'd never forget me.

1019
01:09:33,092 --> 01:09:35,009
She blocked me without seeing me.
Silly woman.

1020
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:36,967
Can you wake up at 6 am?

1021
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,217
- Why?
- Done.

1022
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,342
Get ready to go to Stellar Park in
the morning.

1023
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:43,717
How do you know?

1024
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,134
It's written on her profile.

1025
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:47,425
She goes jogging every day.

1026
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,425
- Show me.
- Look.

1027
01:09:51,175 --> 01:09:53,342
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go to sleep. Come on.

1028
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,009
Let's go to sleep.

1029
01:09:55,134 --> 01:09:56,634
We have to go
to the park in the morning.

1030
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:59,050
Don't overeat at night.
Let's go. Let's go.

1031
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:13,384
Is this the park?
Was it another one on her profile?

1032
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,592
Dad, wait a bit.
She must be late.

1033
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:19,050
She didn't seem like
she was a latecomer.

1034
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,175
She's here. She's here.

1035
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,134
She's here. Stay down.

1036
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:32,425
- Should I go?
- Go on.

1037
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,634
And don't hang up on me.

1038
01:10:57,509 --> 01:10:59,884
- Hello.
- Dad, did she smile?

1039
01:11:00,842 --> 01:11:02,634
- No, she didn't even look at me.
- Is it?

1040
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,675
She's busy running.

1041
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:07,342
But I did get good vibes. I did.

1042
01:11:07,509 --> 01:11:09,259
- Then follow her, dad.
- Okay.

1043
01:11:14,342 --> 01:11:16,759
Follow her! Follow her!

1044
01:11:16,884 --> 01:11:18,425
- You're going ahead of her.
- Okay.

1045
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,384
What are you doing?

1046
01:11:30,217 --> 01:11:31,175
Hello?

1047
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:33,384
Yes.
- What is it?

1048
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:37,134
You said you'd impress her
face to face. What's this?

1049
01:11:37,384 --> 01:11:39,842
How should I impress her?
She's not even looking at me.

1050
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:42,884
Dad, you'll have to go
next level.

1051
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,050
Should I stand on a cycle?

1052
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,717
Dad, culture.

1053
01:11:56,134 --> 01:11:59,592
"Listen, you, who's running away."

1054
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,717
"Listen, you, who's running away."

1055
01:12:15,342 --> 01:12:17,175
Dad, she left.

1056
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,759
She... She didn't even say bye!

1057
01:12:20,509 --> 01:12:21,884
This is a goodbye from her.

1058
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,592
Dad, what are you doing?

1059
01:12:28,717 --> 01:12:30,092
I'm exhausted.

1060
01:12:31,759 --> 01:12:33,134
Let me breathe, dear.

1061
01:12:37,717 --> 01:12:41,300
It's okay, dear.
Girls like her take a lot of time.

1062
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:44,217
So, let's give her time.
I'll miss school today.

1063
01:12:44,342 --> 01:12:45,342
Why would you miss school?

1064
01:12:45,717 --> 01:12:47,134
Go to school.
Don't miss your studies.

1065
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:50,800
We're not kids who'd run after girls.

1066
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:11,759
"By the ocean..."

1067
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:16,967
"I wish to have a companion,
a lover"

1068
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:20,884
"who'd quench my thirst."

1069
01:13:21,384 --> 01:13:22,509
Excuse me.

1070
01:13:23,009 --> 01:13:24,842
- Hold on.
- Mad.

1071
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,300
She smiled.

1072
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:29,425
Go away, Honsla.

1073
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:31,967
I think only Yanky's style
can impress her.

1074
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:37,259
How was your weekend?

1075
01:13:37,384 --> 01:13:38,717
Yes, it's going to be a long day
for me.

1076
01:13:38,842 --> 01:13:40,384
How was yours?

1077
01:14:03,009 --> 01:14:04,050
Yes, Nittu.

1078
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:06,550
Do you want my number?

1079
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:09,675
604... No!

1080
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:11,592
You don't have to write it.

1081
01:14:11,717 --> 01:14:13,467
Just write it on your heart.
You'll remember.

1082
01:14:14,259 --> 01:14:19,050
6047802772.

1083
01:14:19,259 --> 01:14:20,800
Have you written it on your heart?

1084
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:24,384
In case someone hasn't
memorised it...

1085
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:33,009
604...

1086
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:36,092
780...

1087
01:14:36,509 --> 01:14:39,634
2772.

1088
01:14:58,384 --> 01:14:59,592
Hey, excuse me.

1089
01:15:00,675 --> 01:15:01,925
Why are you following me?

1090
01:15:06,717 --> 01:15:08,925
I'll stop following you
if you want.

1091
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,884
Yes, please stop.
Don't do that.

1092
01:15:11,009 --> 01:15:13,300
And what's this?

1093
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,259
Disgusting.

1094
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:15,967
It's an initiation from me.

1095
01:15:16,884 --> 01:15:18,384
I've written both my numbers.

1096
01:15:18,967 --> 01:15:21,967
One of the numbers
is often out of range.

1097
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,092
What should I do
with your numbers?

1098
01:15:26,425 --> 01:15:28,134
Don't pretend to be innocent.

1099
01:15:28,884 --> 01:15:32,759
You need a companion
in this unknown country.

1100
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:36,050
Are you crazy?
Are you mad or something?

1101
01:15:36,342 --> 01:15:38,884
You were the one acting weirdly
at the park today, right?

1102
01:15:39,009 --> 01:15:41,259
I see! So, you noticed me?

1103
01:15:42,342 --> 01:15:44,300
I was making a scene
for no reason.

1104
01:15:44,759 --> 01:15:46,884
So, you were watching me.

1105
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:50,217
You have sharp vision,
naughty girl.

1106
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:52,634
Should I call the cops?

1107
01:15:53,259 --> 01:15:55,342
They'll arrest you
under charges of stalking.

1108
01:15:56,175 --> 01:15:58,759
Arrest me in the prison
of your heart.

1109
01:15:59,342 --> 01:16:00,467
Handcuff me.

1110
01:16:01,217 --> 01:16:02,592
Hold it now.

1111
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:07,217
Your grip is quite strong.

1112
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:09,675
Please accompany us to the station.

1113
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:13,550
- Sir... We're friends, sir.
- No.

1114
01:16:13,675 --> 01:16:15,592
- No, no.
- He's been stalking me.

1115
01:16:15,717 --> 01:16:17,134
I don't know him.
- Friendly talk, ma'am.

1116
01:16:17,259 --> 01:16:18,925
- She is just kidding.
- No.

1117
01:16:19,592 --> 01:16:21,050
She's my nursery friend, ma'am.

1118
01:16:28,592 --> 01:16:29,717
Is he your father?

1119
01:16:33,675 --> 01:16:34,592
Yeah!

1120
01:16:35,217 --> 01:16:38,342
We'll let you off with a warning.
Next time you won't be so lucky.

1121
01:16:51,596 --> 01:16:54,805
- Have you done your homework?
- Yes, I'm done.

1122
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,263
Did you do your homework?

1123
01:17:00,346 --> 01:17:03,763
Well... I even gave her my number.

1124
01:17:04,263 --> 01:17:06,305
You always ruin things
in desperation.

1125
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:08,263
Just do what you want.

1126
01:17:08,846 --> 01:17:10,471
I did what I had to, son.

1127
01:17:10,846 --> 01:17:12,138
I've given up.

1128
01:17:12,596 --> 01:17:13,971
You tell me what I should do, son.

1129
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,763
Now I'll do what you say.

1130
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:18,638
- Let me think.
- Okay, think.

1131
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:21,680
Think.

1132
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,471
- I'm thinking.
- Okay.

1133
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,638
Thank you, Alex. Thank you.

1134
01:17:28,763 --> 01:17:30,930
- You have a good day. Bye.
- Thank you.

1135
01:17:31,305 --> 01:17:33,555
- Hi, everyone.
- Greetings.

1136
01:17:35,471 --> 01:17:38,930
Good morning, everybody.
I hope you had a good weekend.

1137
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:42,096
So, we'll quickly start practising
what we learnt last week.

1138
01:17:42,305 --> 01:17:44,888
So, let's get started. Yes.

1139
01:17:45,721 --> 01:17:46,930
Oh yeah. Amazing.

1140
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:51,346
Thrust the knee
a little bit out. Chest up.

1141
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,846
Hands further up.

1142
01:17:54,513 --> 01:17:56,221
Very good. Hands up.

1143
01:17:57,263 --> 01:17:59,055
Little bit straight up.

1144
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:05,971
What are you doing here?

1145
01:18:07,055 --> 01:18:07,930
The tree pose.

1146
01:18:08,471 --> 01:18:10,596
I mean, what are you
doing in my yoga class?

1147
01:18:11,346 --> 01:18:13,846
I've paid for it. I got
admission five minutes ago.

1148
01:18:14,346 --> 01:18:17,180
I'm sorry for the other day.
I'm really sorry.

1149
01:18:17,471 --> 01:18:20,846
My intuition wasn't wrong.
The situation was wrong.

1150
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,138
- Is it?
- I've really come to learn yoga.

1151
01:18:23,888 --> 01:18:25,555
But why did you come
to learn yoga?

1152
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:28,555
I've heard that yoga
helps you live longer.

1153
01:18:29,055 --> 01:18:32,596
And I want to live with my wife
and child for many years.

1154
01:18:32,971 --> 01:18:34,638
Really? How many children
do you have?

1155
01:18:35,888 --> 01:18:38,888
If I was married,
I'd have at least seven by now.

1156
01:18:39,638 --> 01:18:40,971
Why don't you just say
you're single?

1157
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:43,430
- Oh, yes, single. And you?
- Excuse me.

1158
01:18:43,555 --> 01:18:45,221
- Could you help me with my pose?
- Yep!

1159
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:46,346
Yeah, sure.

1160
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,096
To heck with you!
He ruined everything.

1161
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:50,721
- Hands up.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1162
01:18:51,388 --> 01:18:52,805
Ma'am, can you correct my pose?

1163
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,430
- You're doing great.
- Is it right?

1164
01:18:55,763 --> 01:18:56,555
Okay.

1165
01:18:57,888 --> 01:18:59,930
Excuse me, can you correct my pose?

1166
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:01,263
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh yes.

1167
01:19:01,763 --> 01:19:03,680
So you just put your
hands up like this.

1168
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,138
- Yeah, just right up there.
- Foot should be up like this.

1169
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:08,388
- My foot?
- Yeah.

1170
01:19:08,805 --> 01:19:10,346
- And you put your hands up like this.
- Okay.

1171
01:19:10,471 --> 01:19:11,513
What's happening here?

1172
01:19:11,763 --> 01:19:15,680
Ma'am, my position wasn't proper.
She was correcting it.

1173
01:19:15,805 --> 01:19:16,763
Go back, Daniel.

1174
01:19:17,763 --> 01:19:19,013
Okay, fine.

1175
01:19:20,096 --> 01:19:21,096
Thank you, Daniel.

1176
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:23,430
Ma'am, can you correct my pose?

1177
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:30,055
Breathe in now.

1178
01:19:32,596 --> 01:19:34,096
Should I breathe out, ma'am?

1179
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,721
Back arch. Look up.

1180
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,513
- Yes...
- Ma'am, can you correct my pose?

1181
01:19:48,221 --> 01:19:49,221
Excuse me, ma'am?

1182
01:19:52,263 --> 01:19:55,346
Ma'am, hands should be like this
or like this?

1183
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,055
Like this.

1184
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:02,138
That's why.

1185
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,971
Ma'am, can you correct my pose?

1186
01:20:18,305 --> 01:20:20,638
- Who gave this guy admission?
- Who?

1187
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:23,096
- Yanky! How are you?
- Hi!

1188
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:24,180
Great!

1189
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:26,471
Greetings, guru.

1190
01:20:27,263 --> 01:20:30,263
- I feel refreshed.
- This guy.

1191
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,721
"I'm flying."

1192
01:20:38,263 --> 01:20:39,263
Follow me.

1193
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:43,430
Inhale.

1194
01:20:47,471 --> 01:20:49,346
And slowly exhale.

1195
01:20:50,305 --> 01:20:51,930
Good morning, guys.

1196
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:00,680
Ma'am, can you move?

1197
01:21:01,346 --> 01:21:03,638
- Hold your breath for ten seconds.
- Ma'am, please go back.

1198
01:21:06,596 --> 01:21:07,513
Hello, Daniel!

1199
01:21:13,138 --> 01:21:14,055
Sorry.

1200
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:30,930
Okay, we'll inhale one more time.

1201
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:32,680
Sorry.

1202
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:38,096
Imagine you're in
a beautiful garden.

1203
01:21:38,471 --> 01:21:41,763
You can smell all the
beautiful flowers.

1204
01:21:42,763 --> 01:21:45,263
And you can feel
the breeze on your face.

1205
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,555
You can see these beautiful tall trees.

1206
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,930
You can smell the flowers.

1207
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:05,888
Now a butterfly has flown from the
flowers and is on your shoulder.

1208
01:22:08,138 --> 01:22:11,055
It's now on your stomach.

1209
01:22:15,888 --> 01:22:18,388
Now a bee flew from the flowers

1210
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:22,138
came on your shoulder
and stung you.

1211
01:22:22,263 --> 01:22:23,096
Oh no!

1212
01:22:27,221 --> 01:22:28,388
But you're okay.

1213
01:22:29,638 --> 01:22:34,638
You're enjoying the breeze,
the water and the air.

1214
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,471
Now the dog sitting next to you...

1215
01:22:40,763 --> 01:22:43,346
No, no, you won't scold it.

1216
01:22:43,888 --> 01:22:45,346
You'll shoo it away with love.

1217
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:56,930
Now the one coming to you,
to befriend you is a tiger.

1218
01:23:04,138 --> 01:23:05,805
She's playing pranks with me.

1219
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,846
Take a deep breath.

1220
01:23:17,388 --> 01:23:20,471
You'll feel all this
stillness inside.

1221
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:56,055
Have you been like that since your
childhood or do you have a flaw?

1222
01:23:57,888 --> 01:23:59,055
I was born cute.

1223
01:24:12,721 --> 01:24:14,971
- Why haven't you eaten, Grandma?
- What should I eat?

1224
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:17,513
Your mother has cooked
tasteless food.

1225
01:24:17,763 --> 01:24:19,471
Okay, tell me what you want.
I'll get you something to eat.

1226
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:24,805
Note it down. 'Dahi Bhalla',
'Raj Kachori', 'Gol Gappa', that's it.

1227
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:26,430
Now tell me where I'll find these.

1228
01:24:26,721 --> 01:24:31,055
Get it from wherever you want,
but now Tarkari Sweets.

1229
01:24:32,013 --> 01:24:33,096
Do you know of a nice place

1230
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:35,263
where I can find 'Raj Kachori'
and 'Gol Gappas'?

1231
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:38,555
- Tarkari Sweets?
- She doesn't want it from there.

1232
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,846
- Then...
- Bye.

1233
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:41,096
Oh, Yanky!

1234
01:24:41,305 --> 01:24:42,388
- Oh, yes.
- Come here.

1235
01:24:43,346 --> 01:24:44,763
We need your help.

1236
01:24:44,888 --> 01:24:46,471
- Who needs it?
- She does.

1237
01:24:46,596 --> 01:24:48,638
Oh my God! My guru!
I'm always ready.

1238
01:24:48,763 --> 01:24:51,263
Her grandma has ordered
'Dahi Bhallas' and 'Gol Gappas'.

1239
01:24:51,346 --> 01:24:54,055
- Do you know of a nice place?
- I know a great place.

1240
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:55,180
I was just going there.

1241
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,013
Let me serve you, Guru.

1242
01:24:58,138 --> 01:25:00,555
- No, thank you.
- It's okay.

1243
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,096
As you wish.

1244
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:03,846
Anyway, there are several cases
of cholera these days.

1245
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:08,263
If you want it for your grandma,
make sure you go to a good place.

1246
01:25:09,263 --> 01:25:12,805
May God give your grandma
a long life.

1247
01:25:13,263 --> 01:25:14,221
But cholera...

1248
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:16,388
Oh, my God!
So much pressure these days.

1249
01:25:20,221 --> 01:25:21,180
Ladies first.

1250
01:25:25,763 --> 01:25:26,930
Greetings, ma'am.

1251
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:29,346
This way.

1252
01:25:32,513 --> 01:25:33,305
This.

1253
01:25:35,638 --> 01:25:36,430
Sit.

1254
01:25:37,263 --> 01:25:38,096
Thank you.

1255
01:25:40,138 --> 01:25:40,971
Excuse me.

1256
01:25:41,513 --> 01:25:42,513
Yes, coming.

1257
01:25:45,305 --> 01:25:46,430
- Yes?
- Hello.

1258
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:49,221
- Hello.
- Can I ask you to get 'Dahi Bhalla'?

1259
01:25:49,305 --> 01:25:51,430
- Okay.
- 'Raj Kachori'.

1260
01:25:51,555 --> 01:25:52,346
Yes.

1261
01:25:52,471 --> 01:25:53,180
- What else?
- 'Gol Gappas'.

1262
01:25:53,305 --> 01:25:54,388
- Some 'Gol Gappas'.
- Okay.

1263
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:57,471
Oh, yes. All packed, to go.

1264
01:25:57,596 --> 01:25:58,596
- Okay.
- Oh yeah.

1265
01:26:02,763 --> 01:26:03,555
Excuse me.

1266
01:26:05,305 --> 01:26:07,471
May I go to the washroom, ma'am?

1267
01:26:08,013 --> 01:26:10,096
- What?
- Can I go to the washroom?

1268
01:26:10,763 --> 01:26:12,971
- You need my permission for it?
- You're my teacher now.

1269
01:26:13,096 --> 01:26:14,721
- Should I not ask you?
- Please go.

1270
01:26:15,388 --> 01:26:17,305
I'll be back soon. Okay.

1271
01:26:33,638 --> 01:26:36,346
Okay. Yes, yes.

1272
01:26:37,263 --> 01:26:39,596
- So long?
- I was setting my turban.

1273
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:43,263
- Thank you.
- My treat.

1274
01:26:43,805 --> 01:26:44,763
No, I got this.

1275
01:26:45,096 --> 01:26:46,596
It's okay, you can
deduct it from my yoga fee.

1276
01:26:46,888 --> 01:26:47,930
Keep the change, bro.

1277
01:26:48,138 --> 01:26:49,596
- Thank you, sir.
- Let us go.

1278
01:26:53,138 --> 01:26:55,263
Why was everyone grinning at us?

1279
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:56,763
I mean...

1280
01:26:58,221 --> 01:26:59,971
They must be wondering
what a great couple we make.

1281
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,513
You commended this restaurant.

1282
01:27:02,638 --> 01:27:05,305
If my grandma doesn't like
the food, she'll kill me.

1283
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,013
I'll get you out of
yoga class tomorrow.

1284
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:10,096
And what if your grandma likes it?

1285
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:11,096
What then?

1286
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:17,971
"You say something,
I'll say something."

1287
01:27:18,096 --> 01:27:20,513
"Dear beloved."

1288
01:27:22,763 --> 01:27:24,221
Where did you get this from?

1289
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,971
My friend recommended this place.

1290
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:31,596
Where's my 'Kachori'?

1291
01:27:32,305 --> 01:27:33,763
Yoga teacher?

1292
01:27:37,263 --> 01:27:38,055
For me?

1293
01:27:39,055 --> 01:27:40,763
'Eat me!'

1294
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:46,221
You know what?
Your friend has great choice.

1295
01:27:59,013 --> 01:28:01,471
- Should we start?
- Yes.

1296
01:28:01,596 --> 01:28:02,763
First breathe in.

1297
01:28:05,305 --> 01:28:06,221
Breathe out.

1298
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:10,346
Never mind. Burping is good.

1299
01:28:10,471 --> 01:28:11,721
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

1300
01:28:11,846 --> 01:28:13,263
Yoga is lovely.

1301
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:15,846
Breathing in and out.

1302
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:17,846
- Should we start again?
- Yes.

1303
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:19,013
First breathe in.

1304
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,221
Breathe out.

1305
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:27,263
That's fine, but what's your progress?

1306
01:28:27,846 --> 01:28:29,305
Will she marry you?

1307
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,138
I think she likes me.

1308
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:34,930
- How do you know?
- Next pose, dear.

1309
01:28:36,055 --> 01:28:37,846
You don't have X-rays for this, dear.

1310
01:28:38,138 --> 01:28:40,513
They are just feelings.
And I can feel it.

1311
01:28:40,763 --> 01:28:41,596
Feeling in.

1312
01:28:44,013 --> 01:28:45,013
Feeling out.

1313
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,805
Feelings are coming.

1314
01:28:50,138 --> 01:28:51,513
Feelings are going.

1315
01:28:53,305 --> 01:28:54,305
Next pose.

1316
01:28:59,221 --> 01:29:00,971
Dad, don't be hasty.

1317
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:04,138
Be friends with her first
then go on to the next step.

1318
01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:05,346
That's what I'm doing.

1319
01:29:05,471 --> 01:29:07,471
I'll give her a
friendship card tomorrow.

1320
01:29:09,263 --> 01:29:10,930
Dad, can we sleep?

1321
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:14,180
I need to go to the market
tomorrow with Nittu uncle.

1322
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,805
Get me two underwear
of size 90.

1323
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,555
Grey colour.

1324
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:23,388
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

1325
01:29:25,763 --> 01:29:27,221
The things we do together.

1326
01:29:27,888 --> 01:29:28,721
- Hello.
- Hello.

1327
01:29:32,305 --> 01:29:33,846
The matter has reached
up to love.

1328
01:29:36,388 --> 01:29:38,388
- How long did it take?
- Four years.

1329
01:29:39,846 --> 01:29:41,138
You did the entire course,
didn't you?

1330
01:29:42,013 --> 01:29:43,721
I'm going to get the result today.

1331
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:46,555
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

1332
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,638
Bro, remove those leaves.
They don't look good.

1333
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:50,680
Sure. Thank you.

1334
01:29:51,596 --> 01:29:54,013
What a good day today!
I have good vibes coming.

1335
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:55,138
Oh, my God!

1336
01:30:06,888 --> 01:30:07,721
That one?

1337
01:30:48,096 --> 01:30:50,096
Dad! How are you, dad?

1338
01:30:50,471 --> 01:30:52,221
Dad! Dad!

1339
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:56,346
Dad...

1340
01:30:56,555 --> 01:30:58,805
Dad! Hello, Dad!

1341
01:30:58,971 --> 01:31:02,888
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1342
01:31:03,013 --> 01:31:06,263
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1343
01:31:06,388 --> 01:31:08,263
Dad! Love you, dad!

1344
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:11,763
How are you, dad?
You didn't come home?

1345
01:31:11,888 --> 01:31:13,930
- Dad, mom is looking for you.
- Let's go.

1346
01:31:14,055 --> 01:31:15,513
Please don't leave us.

1347
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:17,055
- The couple is fighting.
- Please.

1348
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,346
- What are we going to do there?
- My God!

1349
01:31:18,471 --> 01:31:20,346
- The world is so deceitful.
- Oh yeah.

1350
01:31:20,471 --> 01:31:22,221
He hid his son in his relationship.

1351
01:31:22,305 --> 01:31:24,638
Look at them.
How mean the world is!

1352
01:31:27,055 --> 01:31:29,138
Why were you screaming dad
in the middle of the road?

1353
01:31:29,346 --> 01:31:31,430
I've told you to call me brother
outside and dad at home.

1354
01:31:31,555 --> 01:31:33,680
It's such a simple thing.
Why don't you get it?

1355
01:31:33,805 --> 01:31:34,638
Take this.

1356
01:31:34,805 --> 01:31:36,763
I didn't know you were
with sister-in-law.

1357
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:39,346
- I mean, mom.
- I'm talking about myself.

1358
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,596
We shouldn't keep any secrets
from Jasmine.

1359
01:31:44,888 --> 01:31:46,513
We should just
tell her the truth.

1360
01:31:46,763 --> 01:31:47,805
We have to tell her now.

1361
01:31:48,013 --> 01:31:49,721
Will I live in the Gurudwara
after your marriage?

1362
01:31:49,846 --> 01:31:51,221
I'm telling you,
I'll tell her tomorrow.

1363
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:54,513
Don't be impatient.
Build her trust first.

1364
01:31:54,638 --> 01:31:55,388
Tell me something.

1365
01:31:55,513 --> 01:31:57,096
Should I stop being hasty
or build her trust first?

1366
01:31:58,138 --> 01:32:00,055
Say one thing.
You're confusing me.

1367
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:03,096
Jasmine is calling.

1368
01:32:03,805 --> 01:32:06,221
You said I should build trust
but I think she loves me.

1369
01:32:07,638 --> 01:32:09,513
- Should I answer it?
- Answer it.

1370
01:32:12,638 --> 01:32:13,596
Hello!

1371
01:32:14,055 --> 01:32:16,888
Hello! Were you sleeping?

1372
01:32:17,388 --> 01:32:18,721
Not yet.

1373
01:32:19,263 --> 01:32:21,013
I just start
dreaming about you.

1374
01:32:21,305 --> 01:32:24,138
Really? Isn't that why
you joined my yoga class?

1375
01:32:24,263 --> 01:32:26,596
Yes, I've been doing yoga
since I was a child.

1376
01:32:27,096 --> 01:32:29,180
Let me see you
at yoga class tomorrow.

1377
01:32:29,555 --> 01:32:32,930
So, what made you think of
this handsome boy?

1378
01:32:34,305 --> 01:32:35,596
Is your phone on speaker?

1379
01:32:36,888 --> 01:32:38,721
No, I'm alone.

1380
01:32:38,846 --> 01:32:40,263
I'm alone. Tell me.

1381
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:43,096
No, the way you've been talking today

1382
01:32:43,221 --> 01:32:46,305
boys usually do that when they put the
phone on speaker to make others hear.

1383
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,680
No, no...

1384
01:32:47,805 --> 01:32:49,513
Why have you called me so
late at night? What's the matter?

1385
01:32:49,638 --> 01:32:50,513
Hold on.

1386
01:32:50,763 --> 01:32:53,596
Actually, I came to
the restaurant you recommended.

1387
01:32:53,721 --> 01:32:54,971
Grandma has asked for food.

1388
01:32:55,346 --> 01:32:58,305
And you know that she acts
stubborn like a child.

1389
01:32:58,430 --> 01:33:01,263
She just wants what she wants
and it's their closing time.

1390
01:33:01,388 --> 01:33:02,430
Can you do something?

1391
01:33:02,805 --> 01:33:04,055
- You're at the restaurant?
- Yes.

1392
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,305
I'm coming right now.

1393
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:06,805
Lock the door from inside.

1394
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:08,555
- Don't be hasty.
- Okay, okay.

1395
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:22,680
Sir, you're here?

1396
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:25,096
We were coming to your house
to give you the key.

1397
01:33:25,763 --> 01:33:28,096
Forget the key,
a girl came here.

1398
01:33:28,638 --> 01:33:30,263
- The girl from the other day?
- Yes.

1399
01:33:30,763 --> 01:33:32,346
She's right behind you.

1400
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:34,013
- Hi.
- Hello.

1401
01:33:34,846 --> 01:33:36,013
- Hi.
- You were behind me.

1402
01:33:36,138 --> 01:33:37,305
I was just asking him.

1403
01:33:37,555 --> 01:33:41,263
She came to get cupcakes
but we don't make them.

1404
01:33:42,263 --> 01:33:44,430
Sir, the salary I got was less.

1405
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,013
I worked overtime, sir.

1406
01:33:47,763 --> 01:33:48,721
He's talking to you.

1407
01:33:48,846 --> 01:33:52,305
He's talking to you, not me.
He keeps saying this to me.

1408
01:33:53,263 --> 01:33:54,846
So, shall we leave?

1409
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:56,221
No, just say what you have to.

1410
01:33:56,305 --> 01:33:58,180
No, that's it. Let's go.

1411
01:33:59,221 --> 01:34:00,013
Goodbye.

1412
01:34:06,055 --> 01:34:07,971
So, you're the owner
of this restaurant.

1413
01:34:12,805 --> 01:34:14,471
I'm a good cook too.

1414
01:34:15,638 --> 01:34:17,180
And I'm very hungry.

1415
01:34:21,763 --> 01:34:23,305
So, shall we have
candle-light dinner?

1416
01:34:24,055 --> 01:34:24,888
Let's do it.

1417
01:35:17,555 --> 01:35:18,346
Shall we?

1418
01:35:20,013 --> 01:35:20,846
Shall we?

1419
01:35:45,596 --> 01:35:47,305
The foreigners are amazing,
aren't they?

1420
01:35:48,596 --> 01:35:51,346
They just say what they
have to at any cost.

1421
01:35:58,471 --> 01:35:59,305
It's happening.

1422
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:01,846
You're cute.

1423
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:04,430
- You're cute.
- Thank you.

1424
01:36:06,305 --> 01:36:10,638
"With the moustache,
you get an Indian look."

1425
01:36:10,763 --> 01:36:14,930
"Your looks are killer."

1426
01:36:15,055 --> 01:36:19,346
"The fair complexion
suits you a bit."

1427
01:36:19,471 --> 01:36:24,263
"Your Balenciaga
adds to your style."

1428
01:36:24,596 --> 01:36:28,930
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1429
01:36:29,055 --> 01:36:33,263
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1430
01:36:33,346 --> 01:36:36,888
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1431
01:36:37,013 --> 01:36:42,055
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1432
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:46,305
"It feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1433
01:36:46,388 --> 01:36:50,805
"When you wink at me, beloved."

1434
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,888
"It feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1435
01:36:55,138 --> 01:36:58,971
"When you wink at me..."

1436
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:03,763
"I'm a little close, and a little far."

1437
01:37:03,888 --> 01:37:08,180
"When you smile,
I skip a heartbeat."

1438
01:37:08,263 --> 01:37:10,138
"When you smile..."

1439
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:14,721
"I like you. I want to be wth you."

1440
01:37:14,846 --> 01:37:19,096
"When we look at each other,
nothing seems difficult."

1441
01:37:19,221 --> 01:37:22,680
"Tell me. What do I lack, beloved?"

1442
01:37:22,805 --> 01:37:27,805
"It feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1443
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:32,096
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1444
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:36,513
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1445
01:37:36,638 --> 01:37:40,096
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1446
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:45,305
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1447
01:38:07,138 --> 01:38:11,263
"You're well aware
of all my routes."

1448
01:38:11,388 --> 01:38:15,805
"My sandals match
with your boots."

1449
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:20,180
"This is my first love.
I don't know how to express."

1450
01:38:20,305 --> 01:38:24,596
"The dresses match
with the colour of the turban."

1451
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:28,805
"Look carefully just once, beloved."

1452
01:38:29,013 --> 01:38:33,263
"It feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1453
01:38:33,388 --> 01:38:37,555
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1454
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,930
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1455
01:38:42,138 --> 01:38:45,596
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1456
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:50,805
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1457
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:54,555
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1458
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:59,263
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1459
01:38:59,555 --> 01:39:03,263
"When you wink at me, beloved"

1460
01:39:03,388 --> 01:39:08,013
"it feels like there's guitar
playing in my heart."

1461
01:40:23,473 --> 01:40:24,973
- Come on, man!
- Oh, buddy!

1462
01:40:25,306 --> 01:40:26,473
Why did you hit me?

1463
01:40:26,765 --> 01:40:28,015
- I didn't!
- You hit me first!

1464
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:29,390
- You hit me first.
- See what you are doing?

1465
01:40:29,515 --> 01:40:31,390
- You killed my player.
- I didn't hit you.

1466
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:32,390
Come on, man!

1467
01:40:32,515 --> 01:40:34,306
- Bomb site!
- Go and open the door, someone has come.

1468
01:40:34,431 --> 01:40:35,515
Go outside and open.

1469
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,598
You go and open,
I went last time.

1470
01:40:36,723 --> 01:40:39,306
- It's your turn.
- I went the last time.

1471
01:40:40,056 --> 01:40:42,390
Pause this right now. Pause it.

1472
01:40:42,515 --> 01:40:44,431
- You never listen to your father.
- There you go.

1473
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,973
- I said, pause it!
- I did it.

1474
01:40:51,598 --> 01:40:52,890
Yes?

1475
01:40:57,306 --> 01:40:58,806
Yanky.

1476
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:03,890
- Honsla!
- Hello.

1477
01:41:04,015 --> 01:41:04,806
Yes.

1478
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:06,640
- Yanky.
- Your new mom is here. Run away.

1479
01:41:07,265 --> 01:41:08,765
The yoga teacher is here. Run away.

1480
01:41:09,223 --> 01:41:10,056
Yes.

1481
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:15,681
Run away.

1482
01:41:41,223 --> 01:41:42,473
Yanky.

1483
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:44,806
Breath in.

1484
01:41:44,931 --> 01:41:45,973
Breath out.

1485
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,431
Why did you close the door
on seeing me?

1486
01:41:55,098 --> 01:41:56,765
You've come to my house
for the first time.

1487
01:41:58,015 --> 01:41:58,890
I had to perform the ritual.

1488
01:42:06,348 --> 01:42:07,223
Enter.

1489
01:42:08,223 --> 01:42:09,265
Don't step on the oil.

1490
01:42:15,348 --> 01:42:17,723
This is amazing, you must have found
the house on the internet, isn't it?

1491
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:22,598
- You live alone?
- Yes, I live alone for now.

1492
01:42:22,723 --> 01:42:25,015
Later, it'll be you and me.

1493
01:42:27,515 --> 01:42:29,223
And you play Play Station alone?

1494
01:42:29,306 --> 01:42:31,515
Yes, I switch between
player one and player two.

1495
01:42:32,473 --> 01:42:34,390
This is what I do, all day.

1496
01:42:39,473 --> 01:42:42,181
Do... you want to
eat something or...

1497
01:42:43,223 --> 01:42:44,348
This must be yours too, right?

1498
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:48,723
This? You found it!
I was looking for it.

1499
01:42:48,973 --> 01:42:51,681
Yes, it's... mine.

1500
01:42:52,223 --> 01:42:53,931
I bought this, but it shrunk.

1501
01:42:54,056 --> 01:42:55,515
Look at this. Here!

1502
01:42:56,390 --> 01:43:00,390
I was this big first,
and now I've come to this. Sorry!

1503
01:43:02,556 --> 01:43:04,306
What do you want to eat?
What do you want to eat?

1504
01:43:04,431 --> 01:43:06,848
Should I make some tea?
Pizza? You want to eat ravioli?

1505
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:07,931
Pasta?

1506
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:12,181
I think you are not in a good mood,
I'm not getting good vibes.

1507
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:18,765
These are my toys.
I like guns.

1508
01:43:21,681 --> 01:43:23,556
This is my upcoming project.
I started it.

1509
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:26,181
I started it when I was a child
but it isn't done yet.

1510
01:43:35,473 --> 01:43:36,848
Those are my childhood shoes.

1511
01:43:37,098 --> 01:43:38,931
I've kept all my childhood stuff safely.

1512
01:43:40,848 --> 01:43:42,598
Can we have tea outside?

1513
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,056
This... this is my childhood cycle.

1514
01:43:51,848 --> 01:43:52,931
My childhood bear.

1515
01:43:53,848 --> 01:43:55,890
Oh yeah! Let's go upstairs?

1516
01:44:02,765 --> 01:44:03,806
This is my childhood.

1517
01:44:08,848 --> 01:44:11,015
Come, let's see some more of my
childhood stuff upstairs.

1518
01:44:14,723 --> 01:44:15,806
Isn't he your son?

1519
01:44:20,098 --> 01:44:23,015
Yes. I wanted to tell you.

1520
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:25,931
I...

1521
01:44:32,723 --> 01:44:34,181
- Jasmine.
- Shut up!

1522
01:44:37,098 --> 01:44:39,056
- Listen...
- Don't try to explain anything.

1523
01:44:39,681 --> 01:44:41,515
Don't you have any shame?

1524
01:44:41,723 --> 01:44:45,140
You have a grownup son and you've
been pretending like you're single?

1525
01:44:45,598 --> 01:44:46,723
Is this a joke to you?

1526
01:44:47,723 --> 01:44:49,598
What are you teaching your son?

1527
01:44:50,015 --> 01:44:51,765
You're playing
with people's feelings.

1528
01:44:52,681 --> 01:44:54,806
People like you should be in prison.

1529
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:57,223
I don't want to see
your face again.

1530
01:45:13,681 --> 01:45:15,765
Iron Man is coming for you!

1531
01:45:20,348 --> 01:45:23,223
Dad, everything was spoilt
because of me.

1532
01:45:23,681 --> 01:45:24,806
No, dear.

1533
01:45:25,473 --> 01:45:26,431
This was bound to happen.

1534
01:45:29,806 --> 01:45:30,848
Iron Man is coming back.

1535
01:45:30,973 --> 01:45:33,640
He's coming. Hold it, Honsla.

1536
01:45:34,431 --> 01:45:38,390
Dad, I know it,
mom left you because of me.

1537
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,348
I overheard your conversation
with mom at the airport.

1538
01:46:05,556 --> 01:46:07,556
You hid it from me all this while?

1539
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:12,098
Whoever you love, leaves you.

1540
01:46:12,431 --> 01:46:15,473
Nothing can be worse than that.

1541
01:46:16,348 --> 01:46:18,056
Don't talk so wisely.

1542
01:46:18,765 --> 01:46:20,223
You love me
and you're with me.

1543
01:46:20,431 --> 01:46:21,890
I love you and I'm with you.

1544
01:46:22,098 --> 01:46:23,348
What do we lack?

1545
01:46:26,848 --> 01:46:28,973
Dad, the new mom was very nice.

1546
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:30,098
What's wrong with us?

1547
01:46:31,556 --> 01:46:33,306
She'll regret it
when she gets home.

1548
01:46:34,098 --> 01:46:35,181
When we wake up

1549
01:46:35,265 --> 01:46:37,806
she'll be standing outside with regret
but we won't take her in.

1550
01:46:37,931 --> 01:46:39,473
We'll play Call on Duty all day.

1551
01:46:40,015 --> 01:46:42,015
I'll take the bottom screen.

1552
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,348
- I will, not you.
- I will take it, that's it.

1553
01:46:44,473 --> 01:46:45,723
You took it the last time.

1554
01:46:45,848 --> 01:46:48,306
Okay, the one who wakes up early
gets the bottom screen, okay?

1555
01:46:48,431 --> 01:46:50,140
Okay, now go to sleep quickly.

1556
01:47:43,473 --> 01:47:44,265
If both of you have come to cry

1557
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:46,390
and do your emotional drama
then please leave.

1558
01:47:47,723 --> 01:47:49,348
I told you it won't work.

1559
01:47:50,348 --> 01:47:52,348
We came to apologise.

1560
01:47:52,806 --> 01:47:55,181
You apologise for mistakes,
not deceit.

1561
01:47:55,265 --> 01:47:57,890
- No, we apologise for deceit too...
- Hold on.

1562
01:47:58,265 --> 01:47:59,431
Just leave quietly

1563
01:47:59,598 --> 01:48:02,348
or the child will also go to the
children's cell along with you.

1564
01:48:02,931 --> 01:48:04,056
I don't mind.

1565
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:06,056
Just marry my dad.

1566
01:48:06,181 --> 01:48:07,140
Marry him?

1567
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:10,431
So that we can have another child like
you and he can marry a third woman?

1568
01:48:10,556 --> 01:48:13,098
No, I swear. You're last.

1569
01:48:13,765 --> 01:48:14,598
Yes.

1570
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:18,348
I feel disgusted to even think about

1571
01:48:18,473 --> 01:48:19,640
having a life partner like you.

1572
01:48:20,348 --> 01:48:21,265
Dad!

1573
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:23,223
What does disgust mean?

1574
01:48:23,473 --> 01:48:26,348
It means, you may be angry
but you still love someone.

1575
01:48:26,473 --> 01:48:27,473
That's what it means.

1576
01:48:28,015 --> 01:48:29,723
Love with someone like you?

1577
01:48:31,598 --> 01:48:33,556
Tell me something.
Where's the first one?

1578
01:48:33,848 --> 01:48:35,265
She must have left for sure.

1579
01:48:35,973 --> 01:48:37,348
My mom isn't alive.

1580
01:48:38,015 --> 01:48:39,015
She's no more.

1581
01:48:45,181 --> 01:48:47,015
She has passed away.

1582
01:48:52,931 --> 01:48:57,015
My father was married before,
now he's a single parent.

1583
01:48:58,723 --> 01:49:02,348
Can't he even marry
if he feels like?

1584
01:49:08,265 --> 01:49:10,056
He's the best father
in the world.

1585
01:49:11,348 --> 01:49:13,681
So, please, marry him.

1586
01:49:17,681 --> 01:49:19,056
He has never asked me
for anything.

1587
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:20,723
Not even a single toy.

1588
01:49:22,015 --> 01:49:23,848
But I wonder why he's being
stubborn for you.

1589
01:49:28,556 --> 01:49:31,931
Before me, he feels
that you should be his mom.

1590
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:37,056
I know you'll find
better guys than me.

1591
01:49:38,556 --> 01:49:40,265
You'll find a better family than ours.

1592
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,140
We won't trouble you again.

1593
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:46,223
We're sorry.

1594
01:50:13,181 --> 01:50:14,515
Was that too much?

1595
01:50:14,806 --> 01:50:17,265
You were a bit too much in the end.

1596
01:50:17,556 --> 01:50:18,473
Bless you.

1597
01:50:23,848 --> 01:50:27,223
Why did you have to tell such
a big lie that Sweety is no more?

1598
01:50:28,556 --> 01:50:32,223
If I had told the truth,
we'd have lost new mom.

1599
01:50:32,806 --> 01:50:33,931
What do you think? Will she come?

1600
01:50:34,348 --> 01:50:35,640
I don't think so.

1601
01:50:37,306 --> 01:50:39,640
- Should I reverse?
- Go ahead.

1602
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:49,556
- Should I drive?
- Yes, you'll have to.

1603
01:50:51,765 --> 01:50:53,015
She's coming. She's coming.

1604
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:56,223
She's coming. She's coming.

1605
01:51:03,681 --> 01:51:08,390
Honsla, ask her if she consents
to the marriage or

1606
01:51:09,223 --> 01:51:10,390
does she need me
to drop her somewhere?

1607
01:51:11,056 --> 01:51:14,806
Honsla, you ask your dad if he'll
change his mind after marriage.

1608
01:51:15,431 --> 01:51:19,181
- If he does, we'll change him.
- Yes.

1609
01:51:19,265 --> 01:51:20,515
That's what you'll keep doing.

1610
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:24,390
Okay, fine, get ready
and come tomorrow.

1611
01:51:24,806 --> 01:51:25,723
Meet my family.

1612
01:51:25,848 --> 01:51:27,306
- We're ready today.
- Yes.

1613
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:29,806
This is a good day for us.
We're here.

1614
01:51:29,931 --> 01:51:32,056
Let's meet your family today.
I'm getting good vibes. Let's...

1615
01:51:32,181 --> 01:51:34,806
Should I first tell them
that I like someone?

1616
01:51:35,848 --> 01:51:36,806
Okay, fine.

1617
01:51:39,056 --> 01:51:41,181
But my dad won't accept

1618
01:51:41,265 --> 01:51:43,348
that you're married
and even have a child.

1619
01:51:44,556 --> 01:51:45,973
We'll have to lie to him.

1620
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:49,681
- Lie? We can't lie.
- We can't lie.

1621
01:51:49,806 --> 01:51:51,265
- Yes.
- We can't lie.

1622
01:51:51,890 --> 01:51:53,015
Anyway, he'll find out
after marriage.

1623
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:55,765
- Yes.
- We'll manage after the wedding.

1624
01:51:56,723 --> 01:52:00,348
But tomorrow, just tell him
he's your younger brother.

1625
01:52:02,473 --> 01:52:03,556
Okay, sister-in-law.

1626
01:52:04,973 --> 01:52:07,973
Okay, then. We did practise
being brothers.

1627
01:52:08,556 --> 01:52:09,390
Okay.

1628
01:52:09,931 --> 01:52:12,640
- Okay, then, see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.

1629
01:52:12,765 --> 01:52:13,681
- Bye.
- Bye.

1630
01:52:22,015 --> 01:52:23,223
You're great!

1631
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,556
What do you do, dear?

1632
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:31,473
He's the owner of that restaurant,
Happy Singh.

1633
01:52:31,598 --> 01:52:32,765
The one whose food you loved.

1634
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:34,223
That restaurant!

1635
01:52:34,598 --> 01:52:37,640
Oh, dear! Then you must get married.

1636
01:52:37,765 --> 01:52:38,806
So, let's have sweets then?

1637
01:52:38,931 --> 01:52:41,306
Hold on, dear.
We will have sweets. It's okay.

1638
01:52:41,431 --> 01:52:44,056
- No need to hurry. Let's talk first.
- Yes.

1639
01:52:44,306 --> 01:52:45,306
Who's this boy?

1640
01:52:46,723 --> 01:52:47,723
He's his younger brother.

1641
01:52:47,848 --> 01:52:48,765
Okay.

1642
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:49,681
Yes.

1643
01:52:49,973 --> 01:52:53,473
- The brothers look so alike.
- Yes, obviously.

1644
01:52:53,598 --> 01:52:54,890
- He's my younger brother.
- I see!

1645
01:52:55,015 --> 01:52:57,556
Dear, you should have brought
your parents along.

1646
01:53:01,806 --> 01:53:05,223
His parents passed away
when we were little.

1647
01:53:05,556 --> 01:53:06,473
When you were little?

1648
01:53:07,556 --> 01:53:08,598
When he was little.

1649
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:11,431
Yes. I've raised him like my son.

1650
01:53:11,556 --> 01:53:13,973
You look like father and son.

1651
01:53:14,473 --> 01:53:16,765
It's obvious, I raised him like my son.

1652
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:19,681
Dad, I really like Yanky.

1653
01:53:20,681 --> 01:53:22,848
- I want to marry him.
- So sweet.

1654
01:53:23,056 --> 01:53:25,348
- So, let's have sweets.
- Hold on, dear.

1655
01:53:25,806 --> 01:53:29,056
It's fine that kids these days
want to marry their lovers.

1656
01:53:29,181 --> 01:53:29,973
Yes.

1657
01:53:31,306 --> 01:53:33,806
Our nephew married
the girl of his choice.

1658
01:53:33,973 --> 01:53:36,140
- Really?
- They got divorced.

1659
01:53:36,765 --> 01:53:37,723
I see!

1660
01:53:38,973 --> 01:53:42,265
And we're afraid the same doesn't
happen with our daughter.

1661
01:53:42,681 --> 01:53:44,265
You should get rid
of your fears.

1662
01:53:44,348 --> 01:53:47,390
Us brothers will treat
your daughter like a princess.

1663
01:53:47,681 --> 01:53:48,681
How nice!

1664
01:53:50,015 --> 01:53:50,931
Shall we have sweets?

1665
01:53:51,431 --> 01:53:53,056
We must now.

1666
01:53:53,306 --> 01:53:55,015
Come on, dear,
let's prepare for the wedding.

1667
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:56,223
What preparation?

1668
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:59,015
We'll handle the catering.
You can arrange the rest.

1669
01:54:06,223 --> 01:54:07,515
Greetings.

1670
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:15,223
Honsla.

1671
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:18,306
Hang on, I'll just come.

1672
01:54:19,348 --> 01:54:21,056
Honsla, where's your dad?

1673
01:54:21,181 --> 01:54:23,015
- My dad...
- Jasmine?

1674
01:54:23,431 --> 01:54:24,473
Tell me...

1675
01:54:24,598 --> 01:54:27,181
- Dad, I was just asking him
where my dad is. - Yes.

1676
01:54:27,431 --> 01:54:29,098
Guests are looking for you.

1677
01:54:29,223 --> 01:54:30,556
Come, let's go inside.

1678
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:36,306
- Where's your dad?
- He must be in the room.

1679
01:54:37,848 --> 01:54:40,765
When there's no one around,
call me mom.

1680
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:41,806
- Okay?
- Okay.

1681
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:53,015
- Mom.
- Yes, mom.

1682
01:54:53,223 --> 01:54:57,390
- I'll go meet your dad.
- No... I'll go call dad.

1683
01:54:57,848 --> 01:55:01,098
Dad! Brother!

1684
01:55:04,602 --> 01:55:07,394
"It's the wedding night."

1685
01:55:08,019 --> 01:55:14,769
"I will lift your veil."

1686
01:55:15,269 --> 01:55:17,519
Do I look all right, idiots?
Or should I change?

1687
01:55:17,644 --> 01:55:18,811
It's fine.

1688
01:55:19,061 --> 01:55:22,852
No matter what I wear now
I am getting married anyway.

1689
01:55:23,727 --> 01:55:27,477
- "It's the wedding night."
- Brother! Brother! Dad! Dad!

1690
01:55:28,394 --> 01:55:30,394
What happened?
Why are you panting, dear?

1691
01:55:30,727 --> 01:55:32,602
- Mom is here.
- Then send her.

1692
01:55:32,727 --> 01:55:35,186
What are you doing here?
Hey, idiots.

1693
01:55:35,311 --> 01:55:36,977
Go out
and manage the arrangements.

1694
01:55:37,394 --> 01:55:39,061
Give the new couple some privacy.

1695
01:55:39,311 --> 01:55:41,977
We're no longer kids.
Go play.

1696
01:55:42,102 --> 01:55:43,311
- No, dad.
- Go.

1697
01:55:44,269 --> 01:55:46,977
- The old mom is here.
- Sweety is here?

1698
01:55:48,102 --> 01:55:49,436
- Sweety is here?
- Yes.

1699
01:55:49,894 --> 01:55:52,686
- Were you dreaming?
- No, I saw my old mom.

1700
01:55:52,811 --> 01:55:54,394
- There you are! We are in trouble.
- What is she doing here?

1701
01:55:54,519 --> 01:55:55,769
You won't marry now.

1702
01:55:56,186 --> 01:55:57,602
Why is she here?

1703
01:55:58,436 --> 01:55:59,769
Dad, hold on.

1704
01:55:59,894 --> 01:56:00,936
Yes.

1705
01:56:01,144 --> 01:56:03,561
- Should I pack our bags?
- Yes, pack them to be safe.

1706
01:56:03,686 --> 01:56:05,061
- Okay.
- I'll go try.

1707
01:56:05,186 --> 01:56:06,436
Yes, I'll go pack.

1708
01:56:07,686 --> 01:56:09,061
Move aside, sorry.

1709
01:56:11,811 --> 01:56:12,686
Hi!

1710
01:56:13,098 --> 01:56:14,264
Hello.

1711
01:56:17,999 --> 01:56:19,416
What is she doing here?

1712
01:56:44,311 --> 01:56:45,269
Oh God.

1713
01:56:46,811 --> 01:56:48,186
Oh please!

1714
01:56:53,936 --> 01:56:55,686
Congratulations for your marriage.

1715
01:56:55,811 --> 01:56:57,227
Thank you. Thank you.

1716
01:56:57,477 --> 01:57:00,311
Greetings.
I'm so glad you came.

1717
01:57:00,394 --> 01:57:01,561
Who gave you the invitation card?

1718
01:57:01,686 --> 01:57:04,602
- I found out at the restaurant.
- Greetings, ma'am.

1719
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:06,394
Why are you here?

1720
01:57:06,644 --> 01:57:08,644
I wanted to
talk about something important.

1721
01:57:08,852 --> 01:57:10,936
6047802772. Note it down.

1722
01:57:11,061 --> 01:57:14,019
- I wanted to meet you.
- What's left between us now?

1723
01:57:14,436 --> 01:57:17,519
I've told these people
my wife is dead.

1724
01:57:17,644 --> 01:57:20,269
- Dead?
- Talk softly, they'll kill me.

1725
01:57:20,394 --> 01:57:22,727
A person has to do such things.

1726
01:57:22,852 --> 01:57:25,352
I'll explain it to you later.
Just leave now.

1727
01:57:27,561 --> 01:57:28,644
Yanky!

1728
01:57:29,227 --> 01:57:30,227
Jasmine is here.

1729
01:57:30,352 --> 01:57:32,852
- Yanky!
- Get out of here. Don't talk to me.

1730
01:57:33,102 --> 01:57:34,686
Yes... Jasmine!

1731
01:57:35,352 --> 01:57:38,061
Oh my God! Where were you?

1732
01:57:38,186 --> 01:57:39,519
I've been looking for you
since morning.

1733
01:57:39,644 --> 01:57:42,269
- I've been looking for you.
- You were looking for me?

1734
01:57:42,477 --> 01:57:46,019
- Yes.
- Bride's face is glowing so much.

1735
01:57:46,352 --> 01:57:48,102
Dad wants you to meet someone.

1736
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:50,227
He's looking for me?
Oh my goodness gracious.

1737
01:57:50,352 --> 01:57:51,811
Let's go meet him.

1738
01:57:52,977 --> 01:57:54,227
Let's meet him.

1739
01:57:56,644 --> 01:57:57,894
Who are they?

1740
01:58:01,394 --> 01:58:03,102
They are our family friends.

1741
01:58:03,394 --> 01:58:05,394
They handle our legal work too. Come.

1742
01:58:05,477 --> 01:58:07,686
I want to enjoy the wedding.

1743
01:58:07,811 --> 01:58:10,019
How many people are we going to meet?
Come, let's enjoy the wedding.

1744
01:58:10,144 --> 01:58:11,519
Yanky, they've been waiting.

1745
01:58:11,644 --> 01:58:13,561
Come. It'll only
take a minute. Please.

1746
01:58:39,644 --> 01:58:41,561
- What have you done!
- This is too much.

1747
01:58:41,686 --> 01:58:43,436
- Oh no! Waiter, you're too much.
- Go change your clothes.

1748
01:58:43,561 --> 01:58:44,519
Excuse me.

1749
01:58:45,477 --> 01:58:46,436
Did you see?

1750
01:58:46,519 --> 01:58:48,436
Fathers are full of
joy at the daughter's wedding.

1751
01:58:48,686 --> 01:58:50,144
Her dad is full of 'Dal'.

1752
01:58:50,269 --> 01:58:53,019
- Okay, then.
- I think we've seen you before.

1753
01:58:53,144 --> 01:58:53,644
Right.

1754
01:58:53,769 --> 01:58:55,769
No, my face is so familiar

1755
01:58:55,894 --> 01:58:57,311
people think of me as their own.

1756
01:58:57,394 --> 01:58:59,227
- You enjoy.
- Wait.

1757
01:58:59,436 --> 01:59:01,936
Darling, isn't
he the one we got divorced?

1758
01:59:02,061 --> 01:59:04,602
Oh, yes, I recognise you now.

1759
01:59:04,727 --> 01:59:06,977
You did get me divorced once.

1760
01:59:07,102 --> 01:59:09,602
Then how did you end up
with Jasmine?

1761
01:59:09,894 --> 01:59:10,727
Here?

1762
01:59:10,936 --> 01:59:13,811
Well, I'm organising
the catering here.

1763
01:59:13,936 --> 01:59:17,811
- Oh, I see!
- Secondly, I'm also Jasmine's groom.

1764
01:59:19,186 --> 01:59:19,769
Oops.

1765
01:59:19,894 --> 01:59:22,936
Does Jasmine's family know
you're divorced?

1766
01:59:23,186 --> 01:59:25,352
Oh, yes, Jasmine knows everything.

1767
01:59:25,436 --> 01:59:28,102
It's going to be a surprise
for the family.

1768
01:59:28,602 --> 01:59:29,561
Yes.

1769
01:59:29,852 --> 01:59:31,894
But you were going to have
a baby too.

1770
01:59:32,019 --> 01:59:34,811
He's here too. I thought I'll
introduce everything together.

1771
01:59:34,936 --> 01:59:35,936
A second surprise.

1772
01:59:36,061 --> 01:59:38,019
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Jasmine.

1773
01:59:38,144 --> 01:59:39,936
There's Jasmine.
Jasmine, please come.

1774
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:41,644
Jasmine, come.

1775
01:59:42,311 --> 01:59:43,352
- Hi. - Hello.
- Jasmine...

1776
01:59:43,436 --> 01:59:47,186
Tell them that you know
I've been married before.

1777
01:59:50,019 --> 01:59:53,227
- Yes, he told me everything.
- I see.

1778
01:59:53,352 --> 01:59:54,977
He's been married.

1779
01:59:55,894 --> 01:59:57,269
Then his wife died.

1780
01:59:57,394 --> 01:59:58,602
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

1781
01:59:58,977 --> 02:00:00,686
Oh I'm so sorry.

1782
02:00:00,936 --> 02:00:02,477
But please don't tell my family.

1783
02:00:02,602 --> 02:00:05,227
- Not at all. If you're happy,
we won't tell them. - No.

1784
02:00:05,352 --> 02:00:07,352
- Thank you.
- Anyway, these are confidential matters.

1785
02:00:07,519 --> 02:00:10,477
I'm so sorry to hear that.
How did she die?

1786
02:00:11,686 --> 02:00:12,894
How did she die?

1787
02:00:13,977 --> 02:00:14,894
Well...

1788
02:00:15,477 --> 02:00:18,894
The rocket crashed.

1789
02:00:19,019 --> 02:00:22,477
- Oh, I see.
- Give me some time.

1790
02:00:22,602 --> 02:00:24,602
- You please take care.
- Jasmine!

1791
02:00:25,227 --> 02:00:26,686
Make sure they get served well.

1792
02:00:26,811 --> 02:00:28,602
- Yes, don't worry.
- Enjoy.

1793
02:00:29,019 --> 02:00:33,394
"When I was young"

1794
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:36,477
"I was enthusiastic."

1795
02:00:36,811 --> 02:00:40,352
Jasmine, please make your grandma
stop dancing.

1796
02:00:40,436 --> 02:00:42,602
I'm not getting good vibes today.

1797
02:00:42,727 --> 02:00:44,477
"I was excited."

1798
02:00:44,602 --> 02:00:45,686
Just look at her.

1799
02:00:45,811 --> 02:00:47,352
I'm afraid something
might happen to her.

1800
02:00:47,436 --> 02:00:48,436
Please stop her.

1801
02:01:05,269 --> 02:01:06,602
Thank God, they left.

1802
02:01:06,727 --> 02:01:08,519
No one found out.

1803
02:01:09,227 --> 02:01:10,269
Yanky.

1804
02:01:13,269 --> 02:01:14,436
Aunt, what are you doing here?

1805
02:01:14,686 --> 02:01:17,519
I found out about the wedding.
I couldn't resist.

1806
02:01:17,644 --> 02:01:21,436
Look, Aunt, both of us
don't know each other here.

1807
02:01:21,602 --> 02:01:24,061
My in-laws have counted
their guests and ordered food.

1808
02:01:24,186 --> 02:01:27,394
If they count any extra guest,
they'll catch you.

1809
02:01:27,477 --> 02:01:30,019
If they catch you, you know,
I'll fight with them for you.

1810
02:01:30,144 --> 02:01:33,019
No, dear, don't fight with anyone.
I won't tell anyone.

1811
02:01:33,144 --> 02:01:34,561
Both of us don't
know each other here.

1812
02:01:34,686 --> 02:01:36,852
Have fun. Look that way, aunt.

1813
02:01:37,811 --> 02:01:38,894
Honsla.

1814
02:01:44,769 --> 02:01:46,811
You're just like your dad.

1815
02:01:47,894 --> 02:01:48,894
You know...

1816
02:01:50,269 --> 02:01:52,394
Why haven't you gone yet?
What are you doing?

1817
02:01:52,852 --> 02:01:55,769
I told you, Yanky, I wanted to
discuss something important.

1818
02:01:55,894 --> 02:01:57,602
- Okay, hurry up.
- You relax first.

1819
02:01:57,727 --> 02:01:58,561
I...

1820
02:01:59,561 --> 02:02:02,269
I'm relaxed. Look how relaxed I am.
Talk.

1821
02:02:02,394 --> 02:02:03,894
- I beg of you.
- Honsla.

1822
02:02:06,436 --> 02:02:07,394
Who's she?

1823
02:02:07,602 --> 02:02:10,311
- Yes, hello! Yes!
- Who's she?

1824
02:02:10,561 --> 02:02:12,894
- She... You haven't met yet?
- No.

1825
02:02:13,019 --> 02:02:15,144
Oh, my bad!
Let me introduce her.

1826
02:02:15,269 --> 02:02:17,311
She's my college friend.
But she's well-settled.

1827
02:02:17,436 --> 02:02:19,061
She's married to a foreigner.

1828
02:02:19,436 --> 02:02:23,561
And she is my wife to-be.
My better half.

1829
02:02:24,436 --> 02:02:26,186
Nice to meet you.
I'm glad you came.

1830
02:02:26,311 --> 02:02:28,852
- Now you should leave.
- Won't she stay for the wedding?

1831
02:02:28,977 --> 02:02:31,519
No, she has an evening flight.
She can't stay.

1832
02:02:31,769 --> 02:02:33,811
But now that you're here,
stay for your friend's wedding.

1833
02:02:33,936 --> 02:02:35,477
No, but she has a busy schedule.

1834
02:02:35,602 --> 02:02:37,519
Why are you after her?
You're so stubborn.

1835
02:02:37,644 --> 02:02:40,352
- I mean...
- If you insist, I'll stay.

1836
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:42,769
How can you stay? You don't
have any wedding clothes.

1837
02:02:43,061 --> 02:02:45,477
Big deal, Yanky.
I'll arrange for the clothes.

1838
02:02:45,602 --> 02:02:47,477
- Enjoy the wedding.
- Thank you so much.

1839
02:02:47,602 --> 02:02:49,227
You're welcome. Come.

1840
02:02:58,644 --> 02:03:00,811
What do you think?
Will I get married?

1841
02:03:02,436 --> 02:03:04,227
I'm getting bad vibes.

1842
02:03:06,561 --> 02:03:07,894
Let me try one more time.

1843
02:03:25,311 --> 02:03:29,186
"The stars on your Lehenga, beloved"

1844
02:03:30,852 --> 02:03:34,727
"make me go crazy."

1845
02:03:36,394 --> 02:03:39,477
"When you start glowing, beloved"

1846
02:03:39,602 --> 02:03:43,436
"it feels like the money
invested was worth it."

1847
02:03:44,269 --> 02:03:47,144
"Chanel size five."

1848
02:03:47,269 --> 02:03:51,311
"Chanel size five
suits you the best."

1849
02:03:51,436 --> 02:03:53,936
"Everything about you is great."

1850
02:03:54,061 --> 02:03:58,227
"Everything about you is great.
Your car is pink too."

1851
02:03:58,352 --> 02:04:01,436
"Chanel size five."

1852
02:04:13,019 --> 02:04:15,769
"Angel, take my heart away."

1853
02:04:15,936 --> 02:04:19,186
"Look at me with your big eyes."

1854
02:04:24,186 --> 02:04:26,936
"Angel, take my heart away."

1855
02:04:27,061 --> 02:04:29,561
"Look at me with your big eyes."

1856
02:04:29,686 --> 02:04:32,561
"Don't be afraid to hug me."

1857
02:04:32,686 --> 02:04:36,019
"Don't get tired of dancing."

1858
02:04:37,394 --> 02:04:40,144
"Look at your white dress..."

1859
02:04:40,269 --> 02:04:44,394
"Look at your white dress.
You paired it with black."

1860
02:04:44,477 --> 02:04:48,519
"Chanel size five
suits you the best."

1861
02:04:48,644 --> 02:04:51,311
"Everything about you is great."

1862
02:04:51,394 --> 02:04:55,436
"Everything about you is great.
Your veil is pink too."

1863
02:04:55,519 --> 02:04:58,644
"Chanel size five."

1864
02:05:11,269 --> 02:05:16,477
"You're so attractive
that you pull me towards you."

1865
02:05:16,852 --> 02:05:21,977
"When you use my name with yours,
it feels great."

1866
02:05:22,186 --> 02:05:24,852
"It's your obsession, beloved."

1867
02:05:24,977 --> 02:05:29,686
"It's your obsession.
I can't think of anything else."

1868
02:05:30,352 --> 02:05:33,186
"Chanel size five."

1869
02:05:33,311 --> 02:05:37,269
"Chanel size five
suits you the best."

1870
02:05:37,394 --> 02:05:39,977
"Everything about you is great."

1871
02:05:40,102 --> 02:05:44,227
"Everything about you is great.
Your veil is pink too."

1872
02:05:44,352 --> 02:05:47,561
"Chanel size five."

1873
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:09,102
Come.

1874
02:06:13,811 --> 02:06:14,977
He's sleeping.

1875
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:17,977
- Did anyone see you?
- No.

1876
02:06:20,019 --> 02:06:21,561
Oh, my goodness gracious.

1877
02:06:21,852 --> 02:06:23,269
What are you doing here?

1878
02:06:24,186 --> 02:06:25,394
Yanky.

1879
02:06:28,894 --> 02:06:31,686
- No, Sweety, no...
- Yanky.

1880
02:06:32,436 --> 02:06:33,811
Listen to me.

1881
02:06:35,352 --> 02:06:36,811
Forget me, Sweety.

1882
02:06:37,477 --> 02:06:40,311
I can't leave Jasmine for you.

1883
02:06:40,436 --> 02:06:42,686
I've moved on in life.

1884
02:06:43,436 --> 02:06:45,227
I've moved on in life too.

1885
02:06:46,061 --> 02:06:48,352
I haven't come here
to call off your alliance.

1886
02:06:48,644 --> 02:06:50,227
- You haven't?
- No.

1887
02:06:50,352 --> 02:06:51,519
Sit down.

1888
02:06:52,269 --> 02:06:53,227
What are you doing then?

1889
02:06:55,686 --> 02:06:57,227
You know, Yanky

1890
02:06:57,936 --> 02:07:01,811
- since I saw Honsla at the airport...
- Then?

1891
02:07:02,811 --> 02:07:05,769
- I keep thinking about him.
- Then?

1892
02:07:05,894 --> 02:07:09,477
- Look, you're getting married.
- Then?

1893
02:07:10,561 --> 02:07:13,436
- Please, can I take Honsla?
- Shouldn't I give you something else?

1894
02:07:13,561 --> 02:07:15,394
Honsla isn't a thing that
I can hand over to you.

1895
02:07:15,561 --> 02:07:17,186
You want to take Honsla?

1896
02:07:18,394 --> 02:07:20,727
You know, I've convinced Sam too.

1897
02:07:20,852 --> 02:07:23,936
- Sam said we can take Honsla.
- To heck with your Sam.

1898
02:07:24,936 --> 02:07:26,769
Honsla is my son, he'll stay with me.

1899
02:07:26,894 --> 02:07:28,227
- Isn't he my son?
- Talk softly.

1900
02:07:28,686 --> 02:07:31,436
- Isn't he my son?
- He's not, we're done.

1901
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:33,686
- Go sleep.
- Please agree, Yanky.

1902
02:07:34,102 --> 02:07:35,186
Yanky.

1903
02:07:39,769 --> 02:07:40,894
Jasmine.

1904
02:07:43,269 --> 02:07:44,227
- Open it.
- Quiet.

1905
02:07:46,102 --> 02:07:48,977
Jasmine, we're in deep sleep.

1906
02:07:50,227 --> 02:07:51,644
Yanky, I want to meet you.

1907
02:07:52,769 --> 02:07:54,477
Jasmine, just spend this night alone.

1908
02:07:54,769 --> 02:07:57,436
A few nights later, we'll live
together forever.

1909
02:07:58,186 --> 02:07:59,727
Open the door please.

1910
02:07:59,936 --> 02:08:01,894
If she see us together.

1911
02:08:02,186 --> 02:08:03,811
My wedding will be called off.

1912
02:08:05,061 --> 02:08:06,727
Just tell her I'm your friend.

1913
02:08:07,227 --> 02:08:09,727
Does a friend behave like that?

1914
02:08:09,852 --> 02:08:11,686
Open up, I need to talk.

1915
02:08:11,894 --> 02:08:15,894
Jasmine, I'm opening it.
I can't find the light switch.

1916
02:08:17,019 --> 02:08:20,227
No, no, no. Hide over there.

1917
02:08:20,352 --> 02:08:21,602
Hey! Why should I hide?

1918
02:08:21,727 --> 02:08:23,977
I'm coming, Jasmine.
I can't find my slippers.

1919
02:08:24,102 --> 02:08:27,561
- Why should I hide?
- Wait a minute. Please.

1920
02:08:28,811 --> 02:08:30,436
- I'll go near the sofa.
- Go ahead.

1921
02:08:31,519 --> 02:08:33,519
I'm coming. I found my slippers.

1922
02:08:33,727 --> 02:08:38,519
I'm coming, Jasmine. Jasmine.

1923
02:08:40,727 --> 02:08:41,394
Hi!

1924
02:08:43,352 --> 02:08:45,311
I was fast asleep.

1925
02:08:48,186 --> 02:08:50,436
You were asleep?
I can't sleep.

1926
02:08:50,644 --> 02:08:55,019
Now don't tell me that
I stole your slumber.

1927
02:08:55,269 --> 02:08:57,852
I won't be able to endure
that accusation, Jasmine.

1928
02:08:58,561 --> 02:08:59,561
Jasmine!

1929
02:09:05,186 --> 02:09:08,102
- My family is so happy.
- Yes.

1930
02:09:08,311 --> 02:09:10,227
They have so many desires
for my wedding.

1931
02:09:10,477 --> 02:09:11,394
I know.

1932
02:09:12,186 --> 02:09:14,186
But I find all this
a bit weird.

1933
02:09:15,227 --> 02:09:17,561
Yes, all this does feel a bit weird.

1934
02:09:20,644 --> 02:09:23,519
Now I feel like we're cheating
them by not telling them

1935
02:09:23,644 --> 02:09:25,602
about Honsla and you.

1936
02:09:25,852 --> 02:09:30,186
Yes, we are cheating them
but what else can we do, Jasmine?

1937
02:09:32,852 --> 02:09:35,977
Jasmine. What's happened to you?

1938
02:09:36,477 --> 02:09:39,352
This nervousness is normal.

1939
02:09:39,602 --> 02:09:41,227
Let me help you relax.

1940
02:09:47,769 --> 02:09:49,269
Do you feel relaxed now?

1941
02:09:49,686 --> 02:09:52,977
Come on now, let's go to sleep.
We have to wake up early.

1942
02:09:54,686 --> 02:09:57,269
Get up. Are you feeling better?

1943
02:09:57,394 --> 02:09:59,936
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.

1944
02:10:02,269 --> 02:10:03,102
What happened?

1945
02:10:06,061 --> 02:10:07,977
Don't you smell
women's perfume?

1946
02:10:14,936 --> 02:10:17,852
You caught me.
You won't let it be a surprise.

1947
02:10:18,352 --> 02:10:20,686
I've ordered a special perfume
for you from Dubai.

1948
02:10:20,811 --> 02:10:21,727
As a surprise.

1949
02:10:21,852 --> 02:10:25,519
Yes. You just get
all the secrets out of me.

1950
02:10:26,061 --> 02:10:27,102
That's it.

1951
02:10:29,394 --> 02:10:30,311
Come on.

1952
02:10:32,102 --> 02:10:33,269
This is strange.

1953
02:10:34,144 --> 02:10:35,811
You don't want to give me my son.

1954
02:10:36,352 --> 02:10:38,894
And you're hiding your son
and getting married?

1955
02:10:39,311 --> 02:10:41,436
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1956
02:10:42,227 --> 02:10:46,019
If Jasmine's family refuses
to accept Honsla

1957
02:10:46,602 --> 02:10:47,894
what are you going to do?

1958
02:10:49,561 --> 02:10:52,269
Look, Yanky,
you still have time.

1959
02:10:53,352 --> 02:10:54,644
Give the son to me.

1960
02:10:55,436 --> 02:10:57,102
You can get married with ease.

1961
02:10:59,477 --> 02:11:00,602
Think about it.

1962
02:11:09,227 --> 02:11:09,936
Dad!

1963
02:11:12,977 --> 02:11:14,144
You haven't slept yet?

1964
02:11:15,352 --> 02:11:17,394
No. What were you thinking?

1965
02:11:42,269 --> 02:11:43,227
Thank you.

1966
02:11:44,186 --> 02:11:45,061
Hi!

1967
02:11:45,186 --> 02:11:46,352
Hi! Thank you.

1968
02:11:47,186 --> 02:11:48,352
Thank you.

1969
02:11:49,269 --> 02:11:52,477
Jasmine, I wanted to talk to
your family and you.

1970
02:11:53,061 --> 02:11:53,977
No.

1971
02:11:54,102 --> 02:11:56,019
You can talk after marriage.

1972
02:11:57,602 --> 02:11:58,311
Hi!

1973
02:11:58,519 --> 02:12:02,144
Dad, I want to discuss
a small thing with you. May I?

1974
02:12:02,269 --> 02:12:03,936
Tell me, dear, what do you
want to talk about?

1975
02:12:04,061 --> 02:12:06,144
Let us all sit together
as a family.

1976
02:12:06,269 --> 02:12:08,561
It'll take two minutes,
we can continue after that.

1977
02:12:08,686 --> 02:12:10,977
What do you want to talk about?
He's too much.

1978
02:12:11,102 --> 02:12:12,644
You can talk all you want
after marriage.

1979
02:12:12,769 --> 02:12:14,811
Let us hear what he has to say, dear.

1980
02:12:14,936 --> 02:12:18,894
Listen, everyone. Our son-in-law
wants to say something romantic.

1981
02:12:19,019 --> 02:12:21,394
No, no... Let the relatives enjoy.

1982
02:12:21,477 --> 02:12:24,727
They are our relatives, dear.
Don't be shy.

1983
02:12:24,852 --> 02:12:25,727
Just say what you have to.

1984
02:12:25,852 --> 02:12:27,936
- Tell us, come on.
- Tell us what you have to say.

1985
02:12:31,727 --> 02:12:32,602
Tell us.

1986
02:12:36,602 --> 02:12:38,186
Can we sit down?

1987
02:12:39,269 --> 02:12:40,394
- Sit.
- Yes.

1988
02:12:40,477 --> 02:12:41,977
We'll sit and talk.

1989
02:12:46,519 --> 02:12:49,102
You look beautiful.

1990
02:13:00,894 --> 02:13:01,977
She's beautiful.

1991
02:13:15,061 --> 02:13:16,186
Well, I...

1992
02:13:16,727 --> 02:13:18,311
Hold on a minute.

1993
02:13:18,769 --> 02:13:20,102
Let him come, please.

1994
02:13:21,186 --> 02:13:22,352
Okay.

1995
02:13:28,894 --> 02:13:29,811
Yes, sir.

1996
02:13:34,436 --> 02:13:37,602
Well... Dad, I...

1997
02:13:38,019 --> 02:13:41,561
Brother-in-law, stand up.
We can't see you.

1998
02:13:44,436 --> 02:13:45,227
Yes.

1999
02:13:47,227 --> 02:13:49,436
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

2000
02:13:53,686 --> 02:13:55,477
I don't know
where to start from.

2001
02:13:55,936 --> 02:13:57,394
Start from the start.

2002
02:13:58,352 --> 02:14:02,727
Well, it's a small thing but
it's going to be a big deal.

2003
02:14:04,602 --> 02:14:06,394
Mom, I wanted to say that

2004
02:14:09,477 --> 02:14:10,811
I was...

2005
02:14:13,436 --> 02:14:14,894
married once before.

2006
02:14:21,894 --> 02:14:23,311
What did you say, dear?

2007
02:14:23,602 --> 02:14:26,102
Mom, I was married before.

2008
02:14:29,269 --> 02:14:31,477
I knew about his marriage.

2009
02:14:31,977 --> 02:14:35,269
He insisted on telling
you all about it.

2010
02:14:35,394 --> 02:14:36,727
- But I forbade him.
- Yes.

2011
02:14:36,852 --> 02:14:38,102
But he doesn't listen.

2012
02:14:38,644 --> 02:14:40,394
- You told them after all.
- Right.

2013
02:14:40,644 --> 02:14:42,394
Such an honest man!

2014
02:14:42,644 --> 02:14:45,186
- Very good, Yanky!
- Very good!

2015
02:14:45,311 --> 02:14:46,852
Such an honest man.

2016
02:14:47,144 --> 02:14:50,811
- Thank you. Thank you.
- It wasn't that small to hide.

2017
02:14:51,019 --> 02:14:55,352
You should have hidden it until
after the marriage.

2018
02:14:55,561 --> 02:14:58,394
But Dad, his first wife is dead.

2019
02:14:58,477 --> 02:15:02,019
She'd fight a lot with him.
He still lived with her.

2020
02:15:02,352 --> 02:15:05,061
She wasn't that bad.
Both the parties were at fault.

2021
02:15:05,186 --> 02:15:07,811
- Did you know his first wife?
- Ask him.

2022
02:15:07,936 --> 02:15:08,602
Tell us.

2023
02:15:08,727 --> 02:15:12,061
Yes, Mom, I wasn't done talking.

2024
02:15:17,644 --> 02:15:18,644
Well...

2025
02:15:21,394 --> 02:15:23,977
I was married to Sweety.

2026
02:15:24,686 --> 02:15:25,811
What?

2027
02:15:27,561 --> 02:15:30,144
You said she wasn't nice
and she died.

2028
02:15:30,269 --> 02:15:32,394
He's invited her to the wedding.

2029
02:15:34,602 --> 02:15:37,436
Excuse me guys... Excuse me...

2030
02:15:37,561 --> 02:15:39,602
Should I serve the drinks?

2031
02:15:39,727 --> 02:15:42,144
Yes, start serving the snacks also.

2032
02:15:43,144 --> 02:15:44,102
You lied to me?

2033
02:15:44,227 --> 02:15:47,811
I told you I had something to say
to you and the family.

2034
02:15:48,019 --> 02:15:51,061
I just combined
both the things.

2035
02:15:51,477 --> 02:15:54,602
Jasmine... The other day,
I said that by mistake.

2036
02:15:54,727 --> 02:15:59,394
And Sweety is already married, Mom.

2037
02:15:59,477 --> 02:16:01,936
That white guy is her husband.

2038
02:16:02,061 --> 02:16:03,936
I have no relations with Sweety.

2039
02:16:04,061 --> 02:16:07,769
If you have no relations,
then what is she doing here?

2040
02:16:08,352 --> 02:16:10,936
Well, I came to take Honsla.

2041
02:16:11,561 --> 02:16:12,977
You didn't get along with
your husband.

2042
02:16:13,102 --> 02:16:15,102
What will you do with his brother?

2043
02:16:15,977 --> 02:16:20,269
Well, Grandma,
I'm still not done talking.

2044
02:16:23,727 --> 02:16:25,561
Well... We...

2045
02:16:26,602 --> 02:16:30,436
We gave birth to a son too.

2046
02:16:32,061 --> 02:16:33,477
Oh, my God!

2047
02:16:34,936 --> 02:16:38,602
Your revelations
are going to kill me.

2048
02:16:38,727 --> 02:16:43,394
And Honsla is not my brother,
he's my son.

2049
02:16:43,477 --> 02:16:45,144
Water...

2050
02:16:45,269 --> 02:16:47,311
- Sit down, Mom.
- Give her water.

2051
02:16:47,436 --> 02:16:49,352
But don't worry

2052
02:16:49,977 --> 02:16:55,394
we'll all sit together as a family
and resolve this.

2053
02:16:55,686 --> 02:16:57,977
Get out.
Get out of here.

2054
02:16:58,102 --> 02:17:00,227
You hid the matter
of your first marriage.

2055
02:17:00,436 --> 02:17:03,352
How can we get our daughter married to
someone who has a seven year old son?

2056
02:17:03,686 --> 02:17:06,394
Well, I'll take Honsla.

2057
02:17:08,686 --> 02:17:10,436
Don't call off the wedding.

2058
02:17:11,019 --> 02:17:13,269
Dad, you get married.

2059
02:17:14,186 --> 02:17:15,936
I'll go to my old mom.

2060
02:17:23,186 --> 02:17:24,602
Can you stay without me?

2061
02:17:27,144 --> 02:17:28,519
Will you like it?

2062
02:17:31,727 --> 02:17:33,686
Will you play Call of Duty alone?

2063
02:17:37,852 --> 02:17:39,394
Love you daddy.

2064
02:17:50,477 --> 02:17:54,352
Honsla will stay with me.

2065
02:17:57,477 --> 02:18:01,519
But I love Jasmine a lot, uncle.

2066
02:18:03,186 --> 02:18:06,561
Honsla and I will keep
Jasmine very happy.

2067
02:18:06,769 --> 02:18:08,852
- Oh my God.
- Get out of here.

2068
02:18:17,186 --> 02:18:18,144
I'm sorry.

2069
02:18:24,602 --> 02:18:25,602
I'm sorry.

2070
02:18:31,894 --> 02:18:33,269
I'm sorry, Sweety.

2071
02:18:45,477 --> 02:18:48,061
Dad, you spoke a bit too much.

2072
02:18:49,977 --> 02:18:52,477
No, I had to say it.

2073
02:18:56,394 --> 02:18:59,352
Look at that.
He caused trouble and fled.

2074
02:18:59,602 --> 02:19:01,019
Deceitful man.

2075
02:19:01,477 --> 02:19:04,519
If he had to deceive, he'd have
told the truth after marriage

2076
02:19:04,727 --> 02:19:05,519
not today.

2077
02:19:06,894 --> 02:19:09,061
He left you for his son.

2078
02:19:10,394 --> 02:19:12,894
This is what I liked
about Yanky.

2079
02:19:13,561 --> 02:19:14,644
He took a stand for his son.

2080
02:19:14,769 --> 02:19:17,061
You won't find a boy like Yanky.

2081
02:19:17,186 --> 02:19:20,644
I've seen how he has
raised Honsla.

2082
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:26,144
Yanky.

2083
02:19:27,811 --> 02:19:28,602
Yanky.

2084
02:19:28,727 --> 02:19:30,394
Hold on, boy.

2085
02:19:30,686 --> 02:19:31,936
Honsla!

2086
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:35,769
- Let it be. We'll go home.
- Dad, let's wait.

2087
02:19:38,519 --> 02:19:41,144
I'm furious but I'm stopping
because you insist.

2088
02:19:42,352 --> 02:19:44,519
Fine, they'll come on their own.
Just stay here.

2089
02:19:48,727 --> 02:19:50,311
- They haven't come.
- They haven't?

2090
02:19:54,519 --> 02:19:55,727
What's this?

2091
02:19:56,102 --> 02:19:57,769
Where did they go?

2092
02:19:58,144 --> 02:20:00,102
They called out just once
and then left?

2093
02:20:00,477 --> 02:20:05,186
Dad, I told you to stop
when they first called.

2094
02:20:06,269 --> 02:20:10,269
I thought they'd come running
and try to patch up.

2095
02:20:11,144 --> 02:20:12,894
What kind of a father is he?

2096
02:20:13,644 --> 02:20:16,977
Dad, the new mom didn't call either.

2097
02:20:19,019 --> 02:20:20,186
It's okay, dear.

2098
02:20:21,686 --> 02:20:24,436
Girls from good backgrounds
obey their parents.

2099
02:20:26,811 --> 02:20:28,811
Dad, what do you mean
by background?

2100
02:20:28,936 --> 02:20:30,269
Family, dear.

2101
02:20:31,477 --> 02:20:35,686
If your drama is over,
can we have the ring ceremony?

2102
02:20:39,436 --> 02:20:41,394
Father-in-laws are like fathers too.

2103
02:20:41,477 --> 02:20:42,769
Don't mind them.

2104
02:20:42,894 --> 02:20:45,394
We've listened to
what you had to say.

2105
02:20:45,477 --> 02:20:47,227
Now you listen to us.

2106
02:20:47,352 --> 02:20:50,477
Yanky, come, dear.
The guests are waiting.

2107
02:20:55,769 --> 02:20:58,102
Honsla, you come. Let him be.

2108
02:20:58,311 --> 02:21:00,061
- We'll find you a new dad. Come on.
- Yes.

2109
02:21:00,727 --> 02:21:01,519
Come on.

2110
02:21:02,602 --> 02:21:03,644
- Come.
- Okay.

2111
02:21:04,644 --> 02:21:05,811
Look at him.

2112
02:21:10,186 --> 02:21:11,936
Okay, fine, I'll come too.

2113
02:21:12,144 --> 02:21:13,811
You won't find a nice boy like me.

2114
02:21:15,019 --> 02:21:16,102
Really?

2115
02:21:26,894 --> 02:21:27,977
Mom!

2116
02:21:34,227 --> 02:21:37,436
Dad said we can stay at your
house during summer vacation.

2117
02:21:37,686 --> 02:21:38,727
Honey, I'm always with you.

2118
02:21:38,852 --> 02:21:41,644
"Stars..."

2119
02:21:41,769 --> 02:21:43,602
- "Stars..."
- Thank you.

2120
02:21:43,727 --> 02:21:46,311
- "as the same colour as yours..." - You
can come to meet Honsla whenever you want.

2121
02:21:46,436 --> 02:21:48,686
- "I got a kurta stitched"
- One photo, please.

2122
02:21:48,811 --> 02:21:51,602
"as the same colour as yours
yesterday."

2123
02:21:51,852 --> 02:21:56,477
- "I got a kurta stitched..."
- Come on.

2124
02:22:07,852 --> 02:22:10,352
"When I see you around"

2125
02:22:10,436 --> 02:22:13,061
"I find you amazing."

2126
02:22:13,186 --> 02:22:15,602
"When I see you around"

2127
02:22:15,727 --> 02:22:18,352
"I find you amazing."

2128
02:22:18,436 --> 02:22:20,894
"Boys can't stop looking at you."

2129
02:22:21,019 --> 02:22:23,227
"Boys can't stop looking at you."

2130
02:22:23,352 --> 02:22:25,811
"When you dance..."

2131
02:22:25,936 --> 02:22:27,686
"When you dance
and do your steps."

2132
02:22:27,811 --> 02:22:31,561
"I go crazy about you when you
dance and do your steps."

2133
02:22:31,686 --> 02:22:36,686
"I go crazy about you when you
dance and do your steps."

2134
02:22:49,186 --> 02:22:51,852
"You pierce my heart."

2135
02:22:52,061 --> 02:22:54,727
"The hunter has become the prey."

2136
02:22:54,852 --> 02:22:57,269
"You pierce my heart."

2137
02:22:57,436 --> 02:22:59,686
"The hunter has become the prey."

2138
02:22:59,811 --> 02:23:03,311
"You inspire musicians
to make music."

2139
02:23:05,061 --> 02:23:09,769
"No one can take their eyes
off you when you dance..."

2140
02:23:09,894 --> 02:23:11,644
"When you dance and do your steps..."

2141
02:23:11,769 --> 02:23:15,602
"I go crazy about you when you
dance and do your steps."

2142
02:23:15,727 --> 02:23:20,602
"I go crazy about you when you
dance and do your steps."

2143
02:23:25,394 --> 02:23:27,977
"You've made
my dreams beautiful."

2144
02:23:28,102 --> 02:23:30,352
"I swear, you've made me
an alcoholic."

2145
02:23:30,436 --> 02:23:33,227
"You've made
my dreams beautiful."

2146
02:23:33,352 --> 02:23:35,977
"I swear, you've made me
an alcoholic."

2147
02:23:36,102 --> 02:23:38,727
"You've made me immensely happy."

2148
02:23:38,852 --> 02:23:40,894
"You've made me immensely happy."

2149
02:23:41,186 --> 02:23:45,019
"We collapse when you dance
and do your steps."

2150
02:23:45,144 --> 02:23:49,019
"I go crazy about you when you
dance and do your steps."

2151
02:23:49,144 --> 02:23:54,144
"I go crazy about you when you
dance and do your steps."

2152
02:23:56,644 --> 02:23:58,352
"When you
dance and do your steps..."

2153
02:23:58,436 --> 02:24:03,602
"I go crazy about you when you
dance and do your steps."
