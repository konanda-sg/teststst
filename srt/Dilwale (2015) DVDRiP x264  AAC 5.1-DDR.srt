00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:17,412
Good morning, Raj sir.

2
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:19,543
Good morning, Raj sir.
- Good morning.

3
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:20,381
Where's Veer?

4
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,250
He's taken Jerry's
car out for test-drive.

5
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:24,290
Okay. Good. Good.

6
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,788
Hi, good morning, Raj.

7
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:28,994
Good morning, Raj.

8
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,565
Raj...

9
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,367
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

10
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:51,373
lt's been 15 years since
that incident occurred, Raj.

11
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,882
Oh, God. Save me.

12
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:59,051
Spare me... Don't beat me.

13
00:02:59,192 --> 00:02:59,783
Hey...

14
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:00,757
Listen to me.

15
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:02,854
What are you all doing?

16
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,355
Stop.

17
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,757
Why are you all beating him?

18
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,890
Stop, please. Why are you beating him?

19
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:10,561
Raj, he stole Mr. Almeda's
cellphone and was trying to flee.

20
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,299
Why do you do such humiliating
things in the first place?

21
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:18,168
Whatever l have done,
is not my choice.

22
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,369
lt's my helplessness.

23
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:20,570
What helplessness?

24
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,806
Alcohol...or gambling?
- Shakti!

25
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:23,813
Let him speak.

26
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,441
l admit that l stole from him...

27
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,750
But it's not for me.
l did it for my younger brother.

28
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,656
For your brother?
- Yes.

29
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,391
After my parents died...

30
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:37,225
...he became entirely my responsibility.

31
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,589
l take care of him by stealing.

32
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,464
Why do you steal...to
take care of your brother?

33
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,559
You should do some work.

34
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:46,366
l am not educated.

35
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,804
A good-for-nothing loser.

36
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:49,602
What else can l do other
than steal from people?

37
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:51,210
Come and take a peak in my home.

38
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:53,871
l've a house,
but no money to pay rent.

39
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:56,982
There's a bulb, but no electricity.

40
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,551
Please...don't cry.

41
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:01,854
Shakti, give me your wallet please.

42
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:03,217
Please relax.

43
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,084
l...

44
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,053
Here.

45
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,249
Keep this money.
- No...

46
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,362
No, Actually, keep all of it.

47
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,521
ln case you need more,
then that's my house.

48
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:12,892
You can come anytime.

49
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,159
You're giving money to this Mani.

50
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,670
But l stole...
- For your brother!

51
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,603
And when it's about your brother...

52
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:25,034
...one thinks from the heart,
and not mind.

53
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,635
Veer...what are you doing?

54
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:01,369
lf anything happens to the car
before delivering it to Jerry, then...

55
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,745
...Raj and Shakti will skin us alive.

56
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,043
Chill, Siddhu.

57
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:06,650
l worked really hard
to modify this car.

58
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,185
l won't let a single scratch on it.

59
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:09,481
Enjoy the ride boy.

60
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,742
She's coming this way.

61
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,577
l think she needs a lift.
- You're not offering a lift to that girl.

62
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,615
Why? - You know what
brother always says.

63
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:43,551
What?
- Girls spell trouble.

64
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:45,715
She's standing there all alone.
- l'm calling him up.

65
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,756
Don't be crazy...
- Are you driving or should l call him?

66
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:48,928
Fine, l'm going.

67
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:49,925
Lift

68
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:54,530
That was a really nice
and tall girl you made me miss.

69
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,726
Just keep driving quietly.

70
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,460
Brothers bootlicker.
- What?

71
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,606
What now, Veer?

72
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,275
l need to pee.
- Pee? What?

73
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:07,538
Come along and give me some company.

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,079
This is not some couple-dance.

75
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,079
And l don't need to do it.

76
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:11,844
You'll feel like doing it while
after watching and hearing me do it.

77
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:12,677
Come on.

78
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,413
Now?
- Not yet.

79
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,247
Now ?
- Not yet!

80
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,419
Now?
- Yeah....

81
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,056
Well, not me.
- Veer. Veer.

82
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:25,755
Concentrate on your peeing,
someone might see you.

83
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,231
Veer...where are you going?

84
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:29,495
Bye.

85
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:30,669
Veer!

86
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,076
Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,714
lshita.
- Veer! Can l help you?

88
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:45,282
Actually, my scooter broke-down!

89
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,046
Oh no.
- l was heading to the Municipal Office.

90
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,617
You see, l am from Bangalore.

91
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:50,086
And l need to submit these papers...

92
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,347
...in order to open
a restaurant in Panjim.

93
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:52,491
And today's the last day.

94
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,354
The office will close
down in 10 minutes.

95
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,928
Can you please give me a lift?
- Let me hold you first.

96
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:59,031
Huh?
- l mean the car-door...

97
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,722
...so l can open it for you.
Please come.

98
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:13,772
Oh, God! Traffic!

99
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,577
What now?

100
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,412
Don't worry!

101
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:24,819
Watch out!

102
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,642
Thank God it's open.

103
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:44,971
Veer, you just made my day!

104
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,475
Thank you so much!

105
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,406
lt's okay, it was my duty.

106
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,241
Bye.
- Bye!

107
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,353
Hello.
- Veer.

108
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:02,516
Yes, brother.
- Jerry had called

109
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:03,718
Where is his car?
- Yes...

110
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:06,091
And is everything okay?
- Yes, the car's...

111
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:08,795
ls fine!

112
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,305
Look, Raj...if Veer was fast...

113
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,497
...doesn't mean you should get furious.

114
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:15,674
Cool it , Raj.

115
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:16,866
Chill, Raj.

116
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:17,973
Cool down, Raj?

117
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,408
Should l go cozy-up in the fridge now?

118
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,442
How did this happen?
What was the reason?

119
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:24,880
Brother, l...
- Pee.

120
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:26,285
Pee?

121
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:30,047
He said he needs to pee...
and l should give him company.

122
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,520
As soon l started
peeing...he ran off. - Where?

123
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,590
l guess he went looking
for an open space.

124
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,062
Raj, peeing out in
the open is too much fun.

125
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:39,687
Disgusting Anwar...

126
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,663
Please don't discuss
your personal habits here.

127
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,526
How did this happen, Veer?

128
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,334
Brother, all this happened...

129
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,961
...because l was trying
to help a helpless girl.

130
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:48,538
Helpless girl?
- Yes.

131
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:51,007
Poor girl had to get
to the Corporation Office.

132
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:52,337
She had a deadline to meet

133
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,673
l gave her a lift, and in a haste...

134
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,309
And brother, you always taught me...

135
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,508
...l should always be good,
even with the bad.

136
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,515
So l...

137
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:02,181
And if it concerns a girl, then...

138
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,755
...even if you've to smash the car,
but still...

139
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,515
...you must go out
of your way to help her.

140
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:07,387
No, no...

141
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,992
What are you laughing at?
- But l was only peeing.

142
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,190
That's all he's capable for.

143
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,128
Brother Shakti...
Pee

144
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,133
Tavde...get the screwdriver.

145
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,477
Yeah.

146
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:26,971
Can l leave?

147
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,815
l've to take my girlfriend for dinner.

148
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,142
Fine, go...but don't
wear shorts on your date.

149
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:33,340
Thank you.

150
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:37,316
Pintu. l can't seem to open this.
- Can l go too?

151
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,481
Where do you have to go?

152
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:41,486
l am taking Tavde and
his girlfriend out to dinner.

153
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,121
Fine, go.
- Thank you.

154
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,163
Be on time tomorrow.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:52,371
Excuse me.

156
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:54,370
Veer.

157
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,236
lshu.
- lshu?

158
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,274
What are you doing here?
- Same old story.

159
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,777
My scooter breakdowns
more often than l can count.

160
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,915
l'll check, l'm a professional.
-Okay

161
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,761
lshu, it's got a serious issue.
- Really?

162
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,758
So now? - Do one thing
Give me your address.

163
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,990
l'll fix your scooter and
enter your house to deliver it

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,666
Huh!

165
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,770
Did you get your paperwork done?
- Oh that, yes!

166
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,099
Thanks to you.

167
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,270
Are you a mechanic?
- Mechanic.

168
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:30,498
l am the owner of this place...

169
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,405
The whole and sole of this place.

170
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:34,412
But all this is because of you.

171
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,014
Because of me?

172
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,051
ln order to drop you
at the Corporation Office...

173
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:40,515
...this is what happened to the car.

174
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:43,417
And due to that...this
is what my brother has done to me.

175
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:45,184
Day and night...just work.

176
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:47,292
Oh l am So sorry!

178
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,964
You feel for me?

179
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,632
Yeah...it's because of me

180
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,429

Sit here. Here!

181
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:00,936
Who are you?
- Huh!

182
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:05,638
But yet...my heart wants to
share its personal feelings with you.

183
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,541
Go ahead, Veer.

184
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:09,078
Do you know what brother did...

185
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:10,943
...after seeing the
car in this condition?

186
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,948
What did he do?

187
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,747
He slapped me 10 times
in front of everyone.

188
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,751
Yes.
- How humiliating.

189
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:17,981
Didn't you stop him?

190
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,624
He's my elder brother.

191
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,986
l can't...

192
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,891
lt still pains.
- Let me see..

193
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,992
But l don't see any marks?

194
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,497
These are not exam papers
where you get to see marks.

195
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,226
Silly girl, it's on the inside.

196
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,336
You know what, lshu...

197
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,530
...since the time l was a kid,
l loved studying.

198
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:37,910
But my brother...squandered
my entire education money...

199
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,410
...on his girlfriend Uma Bai.

200
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:43,482
Why didn't you ever retaliate?
Confront him?

201
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,617
You should, Veer!

202
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,717
What ''You Should''?

203
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,785
This woman's been provoking
me all the while. - Veer?

204
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:55,961
l won't hear another
wrong word against my brother.

205
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,529
He's my elder brother.
- Yeah! Yeah!

206
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:59,128
You crazy woman!
She's mad!

207
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:00,629
Really?
- l don't know her.

208
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,328
Oh...so he's your brother!

209
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:07,973
What kind of a brother are you?

210
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,438
You made him quit his studies.

211
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,009
And who hits his younger
brother like this.

212
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,508
Aren't you ashamed?

213
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:14,977
He won't tolerate this anymore.
Get that? - Okay.

214
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:16,136
Veer, come here.

215
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:17,442
Don't be scared.
- No.

216
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,881
Vent out all of your anger.
- Vent it out.

217
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,577
Come on, Veer...be your name.

218
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,086
Come on, Veer...be your name!

219
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:24,984
Say it.
- Say it!

220
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:28,026
l...

221
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:36,893
Actually...he wants to say that...

222
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,027
...his heart doesn't agree to this.

223
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,263
He wants you to leave.

224
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:44,275
lf l fold my hands and apologies
in front of you. He won't like it

225
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:45,467
After all, he's my younger brother.

226
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:46,704
But don't worry.

227
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:49,508
l'll apologies a lot to him.

228
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:51,510
Fine.
- Thank you.

229
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:53,413
But you don't be scared.

230
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,851
lf there's any problem, just call me.

231
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:58,955
You have my number, don't you?
- You do, don't you?

232
00:12:59,091 --> 00:12:59,682
Good...good...

233
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:02,020
Don't worry, he won't need it.

234
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:07,124
l am sorry. l am sorry, brother.

235
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,131
Who was the girl? You're always cooking up
stories after meeting a girl, aren't you?

236
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,463
Come on. Let's go have dinner.
- No, brother.

237
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:17,507
l've sworn...l won't eat a
morsel until l don't fix this car.

238
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,975
No, Veer. You can't do that.

239
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,510
How can you stay hungry all night?

240
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:22,978
Don't be so hard on yourself, please.

241
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:25,744
Veer, here's your
double-chicken burger.

242
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:27,920
Hi, brother.

243
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:31,447

244
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:36,659
You know...l can change
any car in this world...

245
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:38,626
But not you.

246
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,690
Goodnight, brother.
-Goodnight.

247
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,334
Come on.

248
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,698
Brother took your burger.

249
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:47,940
Should l get more for you?

250
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,338

You're so concerned about me?

Okay?

Come on now, do your work properly.
And don't forget to drink your coffee.

Okay. Take care.

Oh my, God!

259
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,620
''O Girl... o Damsel.''

260
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,025
''When l saw you move...''

261
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,755
''...my heart raced ahead...''

262
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:49,028
''...like a Olympic runner.''

''Beloved...my traditional,
typical beloved.''

275
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,666

Good morning.

Veer... Son, take a look.

301
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:54,558
Another robbery?
- Yes.

302
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:57,525
The music system's gone.
- Yes.

303
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:59,824
l fell asleep again.
- No!

304
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:02,865
lt got stolen even though
you were on watch, son.

305
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:05,630
Exactly...who keeps
stealing at our place?

306
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,702
Oscar bhai.

307
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:12,276
Hi my cool...like an
empty swimming pool.

308
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:13,770
Come to your papa.

309
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:17,211
Here's your BMW 5 Series
Hi-fi music system.

310
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,043
That's more like it.

311
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,583
You know how to pull ropes...

312
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,516
...Like Dominoes and Pizza Hut.

313
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,817
You get things so easily...

314
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:29,594
...almost like you're
stealing from your own home.

315
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:33,789
There's no talent like you here,
Sony Moserbaer.

316
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,901
Oscar bhai...if you're
so impressed by my talent...

317
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,901
...then how about you
give me some bonus.

318
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,132
You see...it's my girlfriend's birthday,
l want to impress her.

319
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:43,275
Of course... Of course...

00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:47,139
Because today it's
also my sister's birthday.

321
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:50,040
Hello, Jenny.

322
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:52,241
Baby l've made arrangements

00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,841
Wow! Wait, hold on.

324

Hello.
- Hello, brother.

326

Rolex, Rado.

My friends have arranged
a birthday party for me.

328
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,024
Can l go with them?
- Of course, without a doubt.

329
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:10,065
Go live your life.

330
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:14,233
Here you go...Pampers, huggies.

331
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,571
Hi.
- Hi, Veer.

332
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,510

333
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:22,671
Thanks.

334
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:25,241
How much money do l owe you?
- What money?

335
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:26,814
You don't charge your kin.

336
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,112
How sweet.
- Okay.

337
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,116
Bye.
- Goodnight.

338
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,120
Goodnight.

339
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:41,993
What's wrong, Veer?
Are you waiting for someone?

340
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,634
My friends were coming here
to pick me up.

341
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,395
l'd given them your address...

342
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,405
Wonder why they haven't arrived yet.
l don't know.

343
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:49,838
l'm sure they must be on their way.

344
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:53,306
By the way, if you want...we
can have coffee together.

345
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:55,276
Together, what?
- Coffee!

346
00:18:55,814 --> 00:19:00,046
Actually, Veer...l was thinking
about you before you got here.

347
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,277
What?

348
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,084

349
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:05,616
How can he? Seriously Veer

350
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:09,717
l've never seen anyone so insensitive
and selfish like your brother.

351
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:12,726
How can any brother
be so heartless? - lshu.

352
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:15,489
lshita, l lied to you.
- Lie.

353
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:18,762
My brother is not like
how l described him to you.

354
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,898
He loves me a lot.

355
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,235
More than you can imagine.

356
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,210
For me, l am always
first and then the rest.

357
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,437
Then why did you do all this?

358
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,880
Well...

359
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:35,682
When l saw you,
l wanted to talk to you.

360
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,649
After talking to you,
l wanted to be your friend.

361
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,816
You were giving me sympathy as well.

362
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,961
So l got carried away.

363
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:43,892
Veer.

364
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,394
You're crazy, you know.

365
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,468
What's up, guys.

366
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,067
This is my friend, Sid...

367
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,138
...and that's his girlfriend...Jenny.

368
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,204
Hi.

369
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:56,604
lt's Jenny's birthday today.
- Oh...happy birthday.

370
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:57,503
Thank you.

371
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:59,838
lshita, l am sure you're
getting bored at home alone.

372
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,138
There must be a problem
with the cable as well...

373
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:02,474
...and the internet speed's
must be slow too.

374
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:03,273
Right?
- What?

375
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,010
What he really means to say
is...why don't you join us for dinner?

376
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:08,186
Now, at this hour...
- And anyway.

377
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,548
You should never say
no to the birthday girl.

378
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:10,847
Yeah!
- Come on.

379
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,648
Come on, lshita. lt'll be fun.

380
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,623
Please come.
Come on.

381
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,022
Come on, lshita.

382
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:18,291
Okay, fine.
l'll just change and come.

383
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,363
l won't sell your drugs here.

384
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,193
Youngsters come here to have fun.

385
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:27,202
And l won't destroy their lives...

386
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,307
...by selling them your drugs.

387
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:31,704
We work for King.

388
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:33,103
King. Get that.

389
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,336
Keep the stuff...and sell it.

390
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:35,741
You have to sell it!

391
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,972
Excuse me...this is not the way.

392
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:39,172
Let uncle go.

393
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:40,012
Don't interfere...

394
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,675
Uncle Joe, you have to sell the stuff..
- Look here.

395
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:44,585
Let uncle go...or else
l'm calling the Police.

396
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:51,287
Oh my, God...you just murdered Her incoming
outgoing international communication device.

397
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,092
What?
- Mobile!

398
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:54,756
Why did you break her mobile?

399
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,231
l just broke it.
Are you hurt?

400
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:58,461
Are you her boyfriend?

401
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:01,038
He's not my boyfriend... - Whether l am
or not, that's our personal matter.

402
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,037
We'll sort that out later. lshu

403
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,039
Uncle Joe...what's the matter here?

404
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,302
They are King's men.

405
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:07,503
And they are telling me to sell drugs.

406
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:08,408
Drugs!

407
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,674
Get lost. Come on.
- Leave!

408
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:30,151
Hey Hero...you don't
know what you've done today?

409
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,192
You just beat up King's men.

410
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:34,365
King isn't going to spare you.
- Get lost.

411
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:54,651
What happened?

412
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:56,281
Beat him.

413
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:00,987
Die!

414
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:04,559
What's going on?

415
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,697
Hey...

416
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:06,727
Veer...

417
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,660
Who is that? Stop!

418
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:10,166
Stop them

419
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,633
Veer.

420
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,064
Veer. Are you okay?

421
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,169
Are you hurt? Who were they?

422
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,298
He's okay now,
you can take him home tomorrow.

423
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,043
Veer, take proper rest. Okay.

424
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,702
Thanks, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.

425
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:28,018
Be honest, who were they?
- l don't know.

426
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,047
Siddhu, do you know?
- l... l...

427
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,853
l don't know, brother.

428
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:36,325
Hey...

429
00:23:38,196 --> 00:23:40,187
... does it pain?
- Not too much.

430
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:41,732
Brave boy.

431
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,625
Here you go,
maybe this will make you feel better.

432
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,236
lsn't this the phone you wanted?

433
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,236
Yes, but how did you know?
- l know everything

434
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,740
Veer, are you okay?
- lshu.

435
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:55,474
She's a casual friend,
but formal hi-hello.

436
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,673
lsn't it lshu.

437
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,809
Hi, brother. lshita.

438
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,576
She's very strict,
she might get furious.

439
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,883
Be clear, lshita or...lshu.

440
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:06,923
Whatever your heart likes

441
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:09,424
lt's a good thing you're here,
or l would've come to you instead.

442
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,188
That day your phone broke.

443
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:13,297
This is a gift for you. New phone.

444
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:14,624
l got it for you.

445
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,800
But...how can l take this?

446
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,869
l...really can't...
- Keep it.

447
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:21,969
He got it for you with a lot of love...
new phone.

448
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:25,272
And anyway...you'll need a
phone for your formal 'hi-hello'.

449
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,568
l insist, take it.

450
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,506
Thank you.

451
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:33,648
Hey... take care.

452
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,520
Take good care of yourself Please

453
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,227
See you guys.

454
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:46,662
New phone.

455
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:02,012
We've found out...
where we can find them!

456
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:42,217
Oh no!

457
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:52,689
Hey...who's there?

458
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,228
Michael, take a look.

459
00:26:57,863 --> 00:26:58,830
Hey, stop.

460
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,193
Hey...you don't know
who you just messed with?

461
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:35,121
When King finds out,
he won't spare you.

462
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:38,862
Then tell him my name.

463
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:46,204
Tell him Kaali had come.

464
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,124
How much did he take ?

465
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,534
He took nothing, just burnt everything.

466
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:14,035
Burnt it?!

467
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,263
Who dared to burn King's stuff...

468
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,109
Who?!

469
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,108
l don't know, king.

470
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:20,539
His face was covered.

471
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:22,805
He just told us his name and left.

472
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,310
How long are you going
to take to tell me his name?

473
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:27,518
Kaali.

474
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:28,482
Kaali!

475
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:31,150
Who is Kaali.

476
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,987
King remember the boy from the garage
we beat up. He has a big brother.

477
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,455
lt could be him.

478
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:39,825
How can it be him?

479
00:28:39,998 --> 00:28:41,966
lt can't be him

480
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,433
Nothing wrong in checking.

481
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:45,662
Let's go take a look.

482
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:00,881
What is it?

483
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:01,747
What?

484
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,511
Hey...

485
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:03,815
Veer. Veer!

486
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:05,323
Veer, what's going on?

487
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:07,391
They are the same guys who beat me up.

488
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,583
Right then...

489
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:10,484
You beat them up, they beat you up.

490
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:12,789
Scores settled. End of story.
- Now leave.

491
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:17,431
But... - Veer.
You know l don't like violence.

492
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:19,033
Siddhu, take Veer away from here.

493
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,159
And give me that stick.

494
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,806
Pintu-Tavde...get back to work, go.

495
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,240
l am really sorry.

496
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,781
l am truly embarrassed...
- Very fair.

497
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,349
That was amazing justice.
- No, sir...it's your greatness.

498
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:36,986
l am just a small-time car modifier.

499
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:38,918
A connoisseur of cars...

500
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:41,523
Like for your old
classic...re-modified beauty...

501
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,687
...El Dorado 1969,
is very close to your heart.

502
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:47,322
Of course it is.

503
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:48,557
And it should be...

504
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,994
...because your beloved
father gifted this to you.

505
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:52,859
You're amazing.

506
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:55,998
Are you a car astrologer?
- No, sir.

507
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,835
lt's just years of experience.

508
00:29:57,976 --> 00:30:00,843
That's fine, but how did
you guess about the father bit?

509
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,114
You're an amazing man.
- No, sir, you're the amazing guy.

510
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:05,682
You're the man, just look at you.

511
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,714
With a hat.

512
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:10,313
Your...your father
must be so proud of you.

513
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:13,553
No!

514
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:16,391
He's dead.
- l'm so sorry.

515
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,557
Are you okay?
- l am okay.

516
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:21,165
Are you fine?
- l am okay.

517
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,465
Can l tell you something?
- Yes, of course.

518
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:29,104
l killed my father.

519
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,608
He was no school-teacher,
he was a Don like me.

520
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:37,041
But when l took over the business,
to increase our sales,

521
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:39,183
l started selling drugs.

522
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,477
My father said,

523
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:43,746
''NO! its against our principals.''

524
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:48,119
Against our principals?!
Our business has no principals!

525
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:50,756
So l killed him.

526
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,425
Patrick! Joshua!

527
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,500
From now on all my cars
will get modified here.

528
00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:00,070
From today Raj will rule on Kings cars.

529
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:02,638
Nice one .. Ain't it?

530
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:06,201
Put that gun away.

531
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:08,409
Put that gun away!

532
00:31:11,182 --> 00:31:12,649
Are you scared of guns?

533
00:31:13,184 --> 00:31:14,515
Everyone is scared.

534
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,654
But you don't need
to be scared anymore.

535
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:17,650
Because l am there...

536
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:20,156
For any problem, you call on King.

537
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:31,459
lf he's Kaali...then l'm not king,
l am the Queen.

538
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:33,035
Let's go.

539
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,736
He was pointing a gun at
you and asking... ''Are you scared''?

540
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:46,205
Since we've turned decent...

541
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,315
...the entire world has turned rouge!

542
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:49,175
Kaali...

543
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,763
Malik sir, we tried our best.

544
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:46,864
But couldn't stop Kaali
from taking the gold container.

545
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:50,199
Raghav...are Randhir's
men getting better...

546
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,534
...or our men getting useless?

547
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,042
There was a time when Randhir and l...

548
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:58,011
...used to commit smalltime
robberies at the docks.

549
00:33:58,816 --> 00:34:01,114
And now he's messing with me.

550
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:07,518
That tone in his voice...is
only because of Kali.

551
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:10,656
Shakti.
- Yeah.

552
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:12,662
Have you checked the list
for the meeting we called tomorrow?

553
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:13,628
Yes, l did.

554
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:16,958
You need to Wrap this
and be careful, okay? And ..

555
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,499
You'll carry on, l'll join you.

556
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,295
And those two,

557
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,938
they need to be wrapped
and they are sold so just be careful.

558
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:23,370
Hi. Excuse me.

559
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,271
Yes.
- l...

560
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,145
Yeah, that one.

561
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,506
l am really sorry that
you're so injured because of me.

562
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:31,671
No, no, it's okay.

563
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:33,316
l'll get well within few days.

564
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,477
l'll drop you in my car.

565
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,986
No, no, it's okay,
l'll catch the tram. - No, allow me.

566
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:40,819
l'll drop you till there, please.
- Okay.

567
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:43,687
l am so sorry.
- lts okay.

568
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,021
By the way,
who were those men after me?

569
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:49,826
What a nice weather?
Do you live in Bulgaria?

570
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,499
Actually, my hobby is fishing.
- What?

571
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,468
You're answering my question
with some random answer...

572
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:56,164
....and l am doing the same with you.

573
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:57,831
Okay, alright.

574
00:34:58,042 --> 00:34:59,304
Who were they?

575
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:01,178
Gangsters.

576
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:02,913
Gangsters?

577
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:05,515
Actually,
they were from our rival gang.

578
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:06,706
What?

579
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,482
Have you heard about Randhir Bakshi?

580
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:13,317
That lndian Don...who settled down here?

581
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:17,554
Yes. l am his son.

582
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:20,124
What happened? Are you scared?

583
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,790
No...why should l be scared?

584
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:24,968
l didn't harm your
daddy don in anyway...

585
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:26,696
...that you guys will come and kill me.

586
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,534
l mean...l am not scared.

587
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:31,537
Then why are you walking in
the opposite direction?

588
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,540
The trams this way. Come on.

589
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:34,812
Come...

590
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,273
What's your name?

591
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:40,445
Meera.
- Nice.

592
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:42,152
Meera Dev Malik.

593
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:43,815
And yours.

594
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:44,955
Kaali.

595
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:48,488
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

596
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:50,093
No, you did something...

597
00:35:50,194 --> 00:35:51,024
What happened?

598
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,197
You look modern,
but your name's Kaali.

599
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:56,333
Oh come on, it's not that old also.

600
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,535
Kaali is a good name.
- No offence, but...

601
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,603
...l am sure your daddy
threatens like this...

602
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:04,868
''Swear on Kaali,
l won't spare you alive.''

603
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:06,840
No?

604
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,473
No?.. no

605
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:14,175
That's funny.

606
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,444
That's really funny.

607
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:16,814
Come. - That is funny, see.

608
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,352
Swear on Kaali.

609
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:23,027
By the way,
Meera...were you born in Bulgaria?

610
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:26,161
No...actually papa came here from lndia.

611
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:29,266
Artifacts were his hobby.
So he opened an art gallery.

612
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:32,061
And...even l do street-exhibitions
of my paintings.

613
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,334
Yeah, l saw that.
- Ouch...l am so sorry.

614
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:39,006
l'm feeling really guilty
seeing you in this condition.

615
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:40,508
You're feeling guilty!
- A lot.

616
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:42,545
Then pay my hospital bills.
- What?

617
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,547
l'm hurt,
l had to buy crutches...and medicines...

618
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,742
You know how expensive they are? ,Right?

619
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:52,253
So you just pay the money,
which will help me. - Okay.

620
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:55,087
No need to draw your gun for
such a small thing? - lt's not a gun.

621
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:58,093
lt's my phone.
- Oh... Thank God.

622
00:36:58,329 --> 00:36:59,762
Give me your number.

623
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:01,328
My number?

624
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:05,027
Yes, l mean...l'll call
your number from my number...

625
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:07,671
...and then you'll have
my number on your number.

626
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,103
Oh really..
- Yeah, really?

627
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:13,473
l mean...when you go to the hospital,
they will give you the bill.

628
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,305
So you'll have to call me and tell me.

629
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:18,676
Or is it ... No?

630
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:27,957
0887 43... 3...what?

631
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,512
Come on, come on quickly.
- Brother.

632
00:37:58,689 --> 00:37:59,951
Give me a five.

633
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:00,989
Yes!

634
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:03,360
What tall you've become.

635
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:04,691
Papa...

636
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:07,164
How are you Veer?
- l am fine.

637
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:10,926
Look at all the gifts we've got for you.

638
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,404
This means l'm not going
home this time either.

639
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,467
No one loves me.
- Veer.

640
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:20,303
And brother,
you don't even remember me.

641
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:21,940
Veer...why are you including me?

642
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:22,808
Veer!

643
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,139
l'll go handle it.

644
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:25,812
Veer. .. Oye!

645
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:31,711
Dad's just...

646
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,316
What should l say?

647
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,356
You're absolutely right.

648
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,790
We only come meet you once in a month.

649
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:44,165
But... that's a different thing that
without you, every day seems like a month.

650
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:47,370
And also you're right,
l don't miss you at all.

651
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,005
But... that's a different thing that
that we only miss someone we can forget.

652
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:58,040
And you're absolutely right,
we don't take you home...

653
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,679
But... then it's a different thing that,
we're making a new home...

654
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:06,452
...which will have a
huge room for little Veer.

655
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:10,427
Where You, me and Dad will
live in it together.

656
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:12,094
Really, brother?

657
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,097
l love you.

658
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:17,531
Bye.

659
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:21,903
What are you thinking, Dad?

660
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:28,707
Just that we can't let Veer
stay with us because of this enmity.

661
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,644
There's always threat to life...

662
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:34,548
...and he's only a small kid.

663
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,446
But Kaali, if it wasn't for you...

664
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:38,120
...l don't know how l
could've handled all this.

665
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:39,314
No, Dad.

666
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:41,320
Can l say something to you in a honesty?

667
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:46,862
Sometimes l wonder...
if l've been unfair to you.

668
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:50,028
You see...l'm educating Veer here.

669
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:53,065
But...l always kept you close to me.

670
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,172
Burdened you with the
responsibility of my work.

671
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,740
And always put your life in danger.

672
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:00,670
l mean...just because
you're not my blood...

673
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:04,337
...l hope you don't misunderstand me.

674
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:05,742
No, dad.

675
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:07,742
Not at all.

676
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:09,945
l had no one.

677
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:12,980
You picked me up from the streets.

678
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:15,618
You want to know the truth, Dad.

679
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,825
Even you don't know this.

680
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:19,930
But you love me more than Veer.

681
00:40:20,164 --> 00:40:21,597
Really!

682
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:25,232
Promise me, Kaali...

683
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:29,966
...Veer should never know that
you two aren't blood brothers.

684
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:31,468
He'll never find out.

685
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:37,775
But promise me...
you'll never discuss blood ties again.

686
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,953
Careful.
- Bye, Kaali.

687
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:44,481
l'll see you, dad.

688
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,121
Hello, Meera.

689
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:55,429
Actually,
Kaali, l called you here because...

690
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,861
...there are some guys
who've been bothering me.

691
00:40:57,969 --> 00:40:59,061
Good good.

692
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:00,201
Kaali.?

693
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:01,503
Kaali.!

694
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:04,703
Are you listening?
- Yes, l am all ears.

695
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,309
Some guys have been troubling me.

696
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:08,434
They bother me.

697
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:12,743
And...l am the only lndian
Sketch artist in this area.

698
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:16,045
So...they also pass racist comments.
- Really?

699
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:17,245
Yes.

700
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:20,088
Just tell me where l can find them.

701
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:22,249
Hey, lndian girl.

702
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,450
Did you sketch that one?

703
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:26,387
You wanna make a portrait of me.

704
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:28,756
l'll give you a kiss in return.

705
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,831
Come on, don't be shy.

706
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:35,636
What is your problem?

707
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,532
Get the hell out of here.

708
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:53,756
What's wrong?

They are gone.

723
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,218
They had to.

724
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:26,390
Come on.
- Okay.

725
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:28,959

- Yeah, wow!

726
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,754

00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:33,021
And thanks to you too.
- No, no What did l do?

728
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:35,428
Meera, you were saying
about those hospital bills.

729
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:36,624
lf you give them to me,
l'll pay for them.

730
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,564
No...don't worry about it.

731
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:41,363
Today is your lucky day.
- Really, why?

732
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:42,937
You helped me out today.

733
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,304
So scores settled.

734
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:47,306
Wow! You're so fair.

735
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,411
l must admit, Meera.
- You must. - l agree.

736
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,309
Take today for instance,
l had to interfere after all.

737
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:52,780
Yeah, the way you interfered...

738
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,611
''Me the man.'' Me the man.
Very impressive.

739
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,744
lt's important to
make them fear you. Yeah.

740
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:59,252
lf only they had stayed a minute more,
l would've...

741
00:42:59,356 --> 00:43:01,551
No, no, no, Meera. Forsake your anger.

742
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,057
You don't get it, Kaali.

743
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:05,788
You have to adapt to the worldly ways.

744
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:07,760
There's no point
in living like coward.

745
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:09,696
cowards are the ones who...

746
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:14,328
Oh my, God! Oh my, God!

747
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:21,576
Don't move, Meera. Freeze.
- Why?

748
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:24,380
lf you move,
he'll feel threatened and bite you.

749
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,450
Looks like a wolf.
But don't be scared.

750
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,552
Just be still. Breathe with me.
Breathe in.

751
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:31,018
Yeah. Breathe with me.

752
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:32,815

Breathe out.
Keep breathing. Nice.

754
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:39,224

758
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:50,765

Good idea.

882
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:04,738
Our rival Malik had his eyes...

883
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,816
...on the gold consignment
l'm talking about.

884
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:09,744
You can say that l have snatched
this gold away from him.

885
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:12,749
And you don't know
Malik...he's a dangerous man.

886
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,448
Anything is possible. Over there

887
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:17,151
You don't know how
dangerous it is out there.

888
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:18,452
Really.

889
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:20,756
You're not letting me come,
nor are you coming over.

890
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:21,990
This is not done.

891
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:25,760
l won't celebrate my birthday
without you, and that's it.

892
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:33,009
Okay, then...l'll finish
my job tomorrow at any condition...

893
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:34,770
...and be back by tomorrow evening.

894
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:36,504
To you.

895
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:38,847
Sure?
- Sure.

896
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:45,419
Promise.
- Okay, yes.

897
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:48,350
Promise!

898
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:57,892
Kaali...we'll definitely meet tomorrow.

899
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,642
Bye.

900
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:22,018
''Never say goodbye.''

901
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,157
''Always be mine,
never say goodbye.''

902
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:06,132
Someone is following us.

903
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:07,694
Keep moving.

904
00:55:28,004 --> 00:55:28,732
Hi.

905
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:30,495
What happened?

906
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:32,069
You look shocked...

907
00:55:32,476 --> 00:55:34,444
...like your entire
world turned upside-down.

908
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:41,550
Didn't l say...we'll
definitely meet today?

909
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:44,214
And what did you say?

910
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:47,523
''Don't come...it's dangerous.''

911
00:55:51,228 --> 00:55:54,755
Actually...the danger
you were talking about...

912
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:58,234
That danger is me.

913
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:01,838
You didn't get it.

914
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:03,903
Try to remember, Kaali.

915
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:07,176
What did l tell you my full name was?

916
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:10,107
Meera...Dev...Malik!

917
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:14,043
Malik!

918
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:17,118
My dad!

919
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:22,021
''The tone in his voice...
is because of Kaali.''

920
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,186
And you know the best part...

921
00:56:24,561 --> 00:56:30,261
...lt's my birthday, but...
l'll gift this gold to my dad.

922
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:34,833
Because...l'm one of
those big-hearted types.

923
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:37,138
That's why l planned all this.

924
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,571
What did you think?
You rammed me with your car?

925
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:43,574
No...l came in front myself.

926
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:45,508
So that my men could kill you.

927
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:51,009
But they missed.

928
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:55,350
And the things l had to do after that...

929
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:57,755
...to get the gold's
information from you.

930
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:01,690
Pretended to be cripple...
l made my men pose as my enemies...

931
00:57:02,732 --> 00:57:05,292
And l even went on
that stupid date with you.

932
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:06,369
God!

933
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:12,000
By the way...how was my acting?

934
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:15,139
World-class, right?

935
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:18,177
No!

936
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:37,658
l spare you...

937
00:57:39,235 --> 00:57:41,066
lt's my birthday.

938
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:02,079
l won't spare that Malik now.
- No, dad.

939
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:03,746
You won't do anything.

940
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,180
l'm the one who's been betrayed...

941
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:06,652
...so l'll do what needs to be done.
- But...

942
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:08,187
Please, Dad.

943
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:11,817
l want to meet Meera once.

944
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:17,332
Hello.
- Stop the car, Meera.

945
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:28,306
Meera, stop the car.

946
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:30,168
Stop the car, Meera.

947
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,250
Don't be scared.

948
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,417
l won't let go.

949
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:54,387
l have loved you with all my heart...

950
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:57,426
...and didn't use my brains,
like you did.

951
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:24,319
Meera... after today don't ever
show me your face again.

952
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:27,687
l will kill you.

953
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:56,421
''Goodbye..''

954
01:02:35,932 --> 01:02:36,899
l am sorry.

955
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:40,597
l've been unfair to you.

956
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:45,865
Whereas to you...have only loved.

957
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:50,106
The thing you had faith on...was love.

958
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:53,042
But the only difference was...

959
01:02:54,217 --> 01:02:56,117
...that you realized it first.'

960
01:02:58,554 --> 01:03:00,385
And l have realized it now.

961
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,760
You might not even believe me...

962
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:09,927
...but l have to say this.

963
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,264
l love you!

964
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,281
Kaali!

965
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:30,718
Kaali, Listen to me

966
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,014
Kaali, l won't leave until
you don't believe me.

967
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:37,019
Please, Kaali.

968
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:39,985
Just believe me.

969
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:41,860
Please.

970
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:44,993
Kaali...

971
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:57,012
Kaali!

972
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:41,520
Would you like some dinner?

973
01:04:42,525 --> 01:04:44,720
l see...you must be on a diet.

974
01:04:46,362 --> 01:04:49,229
lt's raining,
how about l get you some...

975
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:52,262
Coffee! Coffee!

976
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:54,027
lt's okay...

977
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:13,617
What do you want to prove?
- That l love you.

978
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:15,482
Why should l believe you?

979
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:19,650
You believed me when
l didn't love you.

980
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:25,066
And now that l do,
you don't believe me.

981
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:28,201
What's the problem?

982
01:05:28,337 --> 01:05:30,328
l don't want to be betrayed again.

983
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:32,834
You can shoot me if l do.

984
01:05:33,142 --> 01:05:36,600
Firing bullets...
using guns.. taking lives.

985
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:41,509
lsn't there anything else you can do?

986
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:44,012
l don't.

987
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:46,851
But you do.

988
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:51,059
You Teach me.

989
01:05:52,195 --> 01:05:53,389
Please!

990
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:31,059
''Permeating through the sunlight.''

991
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:33,702
''Slipping through the shades.''

992
01:06:34,003 --> 01:06:36,528
''When we met...''

993
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:39,264
''...the moment froze.''

994
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:41,910
''The sky melted.''

995
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:44,671
''Converged into a glass.''

996
01:06:44,914 --> 01:06:49,408
''And froze into the
shape of your face.''

997
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:52,043
''l've renounced the world...

998
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:54,555
''...to be with you.''

999
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:59,691
''Just one prayer that
comes from my heart.''

1000
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:05,096
''Color me saffron''

1001
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:10,704
''A prayer straight
from the beloved's heart.''

1002
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:15,874
''Color me saffron''

1003
01:07:16,712 --> 01:07:21,672
''A prayer straight from the heart.''

1004
01:07:22,118 --> 01:07:26,714
''Color me saffron''

1005
01:07:47,843 --> 01:07:50,539
''Starts with you...''

1006
01:07:50,913 --> 01:07:53,313
''...and ends on you.''

1007
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:58,885
''This saga is eternal.''

1008
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,453
''l am the journey...''

1009
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:04,124
''...and you're the destination.''

1010
01:08:04,493 --> 01:08:06,893
''Every path...''

1011
01:08:07,163 --> 01:08:10,496
''...leads only to you.''

1012
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:12,996
''As my heart...''

1013
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:15,666
''...carefully united with yours.''

1014
01:08:16,072 --> 01:08:20,566
''lt alleviated the fog of my pain.''

1015
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:23,003
''l've renounced the world...''

1016
01:08:23,546 --> 01:08:25,673
''..to be with you.''

''A prayer straight
from the beloved's heart.''

1020

''Color me saffron''

1021
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:05,450
''My world...''

1022
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:08,253
''...was completely lonely.''

1023
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:13,721
''But since the day you arrived...''

1024
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:24,563
''Your arrival, gave life...
to my soulless body.''

1025
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:30,678
''All the relations in the world...''

1026
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:35,547
''...seem meaningless.''

1027
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:38,013
''My bond with you has deepened ''

1028
01:09:38,587 --> 01:09:40,680
''l've renounced the world...

''Color me saffron''

1035
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,572
Kaali.

1036
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,019
We should tell our families about us.

1037
01:10:45,254 --> 01:10:49,020
l don't want them to
find out from somewhere else.

1038
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:50,653
lt won't be nice.

1039
01:10:51,761 --> 01:10:53,285
Yeah, you're right.

1040
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,294
You know, l can convince my dad.

1041
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,058
But what about your dad?

1042
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:01,026
l hope he doesn't think that...

1043
01:11:01,237 --> 01:11:04,729
...Me and my dad have cooked
up some plan to deceive him.

1044
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:06,569
l will explain it to him.

1045
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:11,043
And anyway, he doesn't hate you
as much as he loves me.

1046
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:14,747
Yeah...l am sure.

1047
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:21,452
But tell me one thing ...what if Me
and my dad have really made a plan?

1048
01:11:27,229 --> 01:11:28,856
So Then l will shoot you!

1049
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:55,857
Another robbery?
- Yeah.

1050
01:11:56,225 --> 01:11:58,659
lmported headlights are gone too.
- Yeah.

1051
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:00,829
l fell asleep again?
- Yes.

1052
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,493
You're so consistent, Veer.

1053
01:12:03,632 --> 01:12:05,827
This car needs to be
delivered in the evening...

1054
01:12:06,035 --> 01:12:07,366
...but we don't have headlights.

1055
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:08,637
l wonder what's going to happen.

1056
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:10,763
Don't worry, brother.

1057
01:12:11,407 --> 01:12:12,135
This is my fault.

1058
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:14,940
l'll think of something.
Leave it to me.

1059
01:12:16,445 --> 01:12:17,469
Anwar, what are you doing?

1060
01:12:17,646 --> 01:12:18,806
Raj, he's is the thief.

1061
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:20,573
Look at what he was stealing
and going with.

1062
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:22,650
Mani, back to your old tricks again.

1063
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:23,679
lt's a cake.

1064
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,444
That's what l've been trying
to tell you, that it's a cake!

1065
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:26,919
Mani, you're stealing cakes now?

1066
01:12:27,022 --> 01:12:29,183
No, Raj, it's my happy birthday.

1067
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:31,986
l bought this cake from his café.
Look, l even have the bill.

1068
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:34,253
l thought l'll sit
with my brother Raj...

1069
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,295
...and we'll eat this cake together.

1070
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:38,990
Just because a man is dark skinned
you will trash him so hard.

1071
01:12:39,168 --> 01:12:40,100
Sorry, Mani. Sorry.

1072
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:41,965
Anwar, how could you
without seeing or thinking...

1073
01:12:42,104 --> 01:12:43,696
Mani, there's been a
theft in the garage again.

1074
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,396
So there's a bit of confusion.
- l see.

1075
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:46,668
Sorry.
- No, no not a problem.

1076
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:49,003
Come on... let it go..let's cut it.
- Who?

1077
01:12:49,178 --> 01:12:50,270
Your cake.

1078
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:51,704
l got scared.

1079
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:52,846
Anwar, get the candles.

1080
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:54,448
Don't take it to your heart,
he's a bit emotional.

1081
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:56,108
So he raised his hand on you.
Anwar

1082
01:12:56,252 --> 01:12:57,116
You too Anwar.

1083
01:12:58,254 --> 01:13:01,121
Hey...why are you sulking?

1084
01:13:01,857 --> 01:13:03,688
Mani bhai, l need to arrange
for imported headlights.

1085
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:05,087
Where do l get them from?

1086
01:13:05,394 --> 01:13:07,589
lmported headlights?
- Yeah.

1087
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:09,588
Don't worry.

1088
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:12,129
There's only one
man you can get it from.

1089
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:13,264
Oscar bhai.

1090
01:13:13,402 --> 01:13:17,896
Wow, Mani...you're so lucky...
Like Nokia, Blackberry.

1091
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:20,605
My no. 1 thief just called.

1092
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:22,777
He's getting the same
brand projector lamps...

1093
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:24,445
...like the one you wanted.

1094
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:28,072
He said he stole it last night.

1095
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,248
Do it fast, son.

1096
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:35,079
See...this speaker and
That music-system...which are sold.

1097
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:36,782
Look here.

1098
01:13:36,992 --> 01:13:38,823
This is a BMW Steering Wheel.

1099
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:42,259
All this is his loot, Mani.

1100
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:45,160
When will my...
l mean, your no.1 thief?

1101
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:47,427
Wait for 5 minutes.

1102
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:51,595
He must be on the way...
McDonald Subway. - Okay.

1103
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:53,269
We'll wait outside.
- Yeah.

1104
01:13:53,442 --> 01:13:56,172
lt's the same thief who
robbed our entire garage.

1105
01:13:56,445 --> 01:13:57,935
Let him come...
- Yeah, let him.

1106
01:13:58,047 --> 01:14:00,982
l'll tie a wrist
watch on both his arms.

1107
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:02,415
What will that do?

1108
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:04,848
Then he'll know his time's up.

1109
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:16,057
He's got the same headlights.

1110
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,762
Oscar bhai...
- Yeah.

1111
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:28,773
Here's comes my number one
'Chor' (thief).... Boxer, Labrador.

1112
01:14:28,978 --> 01:14:29,945
Keep it.

1113
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:33,173
You are my ace of spades...
best in best.

1114
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:36,040
Keep this...30, 000 Siddhu.

1115
01:14:36,251 --> 01:14:38,845
Go and squander all
of it on your girlfriend.

1116
01:14:39,054 --> 01:14:40,988
But tell me one thing.

1117
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:45,718
Just like ATM spins out money,
how do you manage all this?

1118
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:47,553
Coffee.
- Coffee? Coffee

1119
01:14:48,397 --> 01:14:50,695
Oscar bhai, l've a friend.

1120
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:52,730
And he trusts me more than required

1121
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:55,028
l put sleeping pills
in his coffee, and...

1122
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:56,561
Siddhu...!

1123
01:14:57,573 --> 01:15:00,508
Veer...what are you doing here?

1124
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,067
Veer, listen to me...
Let's sit down and talk.

1125
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:04,201
Rascal..

1126
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,878
Veer...
- Beat him.

1127
01:15:07,082 --> 01:15:09,107
Why are you running?
Stop!

1128
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:10,415
Stop thief.

1129
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:13,619
Don't let him go.

1130
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:16,418
Veer. Veer.

1131
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:17,183
Stop!

1132
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,184
Veer...
Veer, listen to me.

1133
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:20,225
Veer. Veer.

1134
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:22,657
Hit him.
Hit him. Hit him.

1135
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:24,832
How dare you touch Raj's stuff?

1136
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:26,628
How dare you steal at Raj's place?

1137
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:29,837
l'll cut off your hands.
Veer, enough. Enough!

1138
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:31,233
Nagpada. Agripada...

1139
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:33,338
He's down. He's fallen down.

1140
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:36,603
Veer... Veer, we can discuss
this over a cup of coffee.

1141
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:37,541
Coffee!

1142
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,547
To hell with your coffee...
- Enough! Enough Veer!

1143
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:43,647
l took you as a brother not as a friend.

1144
01:15:43,852 --> 01:15:46,150
l would've tolerated it
lf anyone else had done this.

1145
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:47,483
But you did this to me.

1146
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:50,084
Let's go, Mani.

1147
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:52,053
What happened Veer?

1148
01:15:53,562 --> 01:15:57,464
l didn't ask you to stop...
then why did you stop?

1149
01:15:57,566 --> 01:15:59,261
You must have said 'stop' 50 times.

1150
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:01,528
l just blurted that out in extempore.

1151
01:16:02,971 --> 01:16:04,734
How can a bus fit in a tempo

1152
01:16:04,907 --> 01:16:07,876
Extempore...Mani bhai.
- Was it a big tempo?

1153
01:16:07,976 --> 01:16:09,273
Mani...quiet!

1154
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:15,007
Veer...you saw what your brother did.

1155
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:15,912
And how.

1156
01:16:16,018 --> 01:16:18,145
But...you consider me a brother,
don't you?

1157
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:21,854
You never bothered
to ask why l did it.

1158
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:24,055
Look at me.

1159
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:26,121
The same old shirt,
the same old jeans...

1160
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:29,129
...and the same old
shoes that you gave me.

1161
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:32,663
l have never spent a penny on myself.

1162
01:16:33,235 --> 01:16:37,228
l have spent everything
on my love...my Jenny.

1163
01:16:38,774 --> 01:16:42,335
lt wasn't easy to win her heart.

1164
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,072
You rascal...look at your own fate.

1165
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:51,016
We both grew up in a boy's hostel.

1166
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,144
No sign or symbol of girls

1167
01:16:53,288 --> 01:16:54,084
And when we came out...

1168
01:16:54,223 --> 01:16:55,451
... we were surrounded
by a brother or an uncle...

1169
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:58,389
We spent our entire youth amongst men!

1170
01:17:03,398 --> 01:17:05,366
lt's true, Siddhu.

1171
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:09,697
l went through so much trouble
to cajole that Monica aunty.

1172
01:17:09,805 --> 01:17:10,567
Aunty?

1173
01:17:11,473 --> 01:17:13,202
The neighbor's maid.
- l see.

1174
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:14,604
l was serious about her.

1175
01:17:14,743 --> 01:17:16,301
But before l could tell her...

1176
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:18,504
...she ran off with
that puncture-repairer.

1177
01:17:19,314 --> 01:17:23,444
Life's been so hard on us...
that we never got any girl in our life.

1178
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:29,419
And see...l can't even
tell lshita...that l love her.

1179
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:33,593
Veer, why are you crying?
- You're crying too.

1180
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:35,286
Your brother's still alive.

1181
01:17:35,397 --> 01:17:38,059
l will help you.
- You will.

1182
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,896
Yes...and you'll help me in return.

1183
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,628
You won't tell our brothers...

1184
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,432
...that l was the one
who stole all that stuff.

1185
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:45,369
Rascal...

1186
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:49,133
Sorry, but you just wait and
watch the ideas l give you now.

1187
01:17:49,244 --> 01:17:50,836
You won't stay bachelor any more.

1188
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:52,877
ln fact, no one will
stay bachelor anymore.

1189
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:55,642
We'll even find a Mani-ben
for this Mani-bhai.

1190
01:17:56,084 --> 01:17:57,346
Well said.

1191
01:17:57,653 --> 01:18:01,384
Even my parents never
thought about me, but you did.

1192
01:18:01,924 --> 01:18:05,155
You're not human, you're definitely
some angel. Get yourself checked up.

1193
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,693
l am there.

1194
01:18:06,962 --> 01:18:08,623
Veer, just see what l do now.

1195
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,129
Just wait and watch.

1196
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:12,496
What are you doing?
- What's this?

1197
01:18:15,671 --> 01:18:17,571
Where's Veer?
Why isn't he here yet?

1198
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:19,641
Veer? Look!

1199
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:25,840
He's waiting for you there.

1200
01:18:26,014 --> 01:18:27,481
Waiting for me?

1201
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,618
Hi.
- Hi.

1202
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:40,121
lshita, l could never
muster the courage to say this.

1203
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:42,955
But on this Christmas Eve...

1204
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:44,999
...l want to convey his message to you.

1205
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:46,359
Whose?

1206
01:18:48,871 --> 01:18:49,997
My heart..

1207
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:51,869
Go ahead.

1208
01:18:51,974 --> 01:18:55,808
Well, normally people celebrate
Christmas with someone special.

1209
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:58,672
But they are all
dying to go out with me.

1210
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:02,682
But l will only go...

1211
01:19:04,186 --> 01:19:05,175
...with her!

1212
01:19:08,156 --> 01:19:09,350
l've lied to you many times.

1213
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:12,558
But it's said that we should
speak only the truth on Christmas.

1214
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:15,926
So the truth is l really...

1215
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:22,935
l will be with you every
moment...for all my life.

1216
01:19:23,171 --> 01:19:25,799
Even if you look
like this years later.

1217
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,680
Brother...please handle it.

1218
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:58,063
Veer.

1219
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:01,504
There's something l want to say.

1220
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:03,007
Tell me

1221
01:20:04,146 --> 01:20:07,081
l think we should tell
our families about us.

1222
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:09,843
What's the hurry, lshu?
- l mean we've just started now.

1223
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:10,919
Veer...

1224
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:13,521
l don't want them to
find out from someone else.

1225
01:20:13,722 --> 01:20:15,212
l won't like it.

1226
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,616
We should talk to them.

1227
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:17,622
Yeah.

1228
01:20:17,793 --> 01:20:18,691
What yeah...

1229
01:20:18,794 --> 01:20:20,318
l will talk to my family...

1230
01:20:20,562 --> 01:20:23,531
Will you be able to tell your brother, or...
- lshu.

1231
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:26,063
We love each other. lt's not a crime.

1232
01:20:26,234 --> 01:20:28,862
l'll tell brother on his face...

1233
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:35,473
lt's been 28 minutes...
will you say something?

1234
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:38,078
All you've been saying
is ''l want to say something''...

1235
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:38,736
What?

1236
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:41,677
l want to share my
personal feelings with you.

1237
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:42,715
Yeah.

1238
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:46,645
l need some time.
- Okay, okay, take your time.

1239
01:20:54,129 --> 01:20:56,359
l want to celebrate my
'Suhagraat' (wedding night).

1240
01:20:57,532 --> 01:20:58,362
With whom?

1241
01:20:59,534 --> 01:21:00,432
Su...

1242
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,037
Subhash... l want to
tell you about Subhash.

1243
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:05,663
He's bringing the bumper
tomorrow...at the garage.

1244
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:07,704
You took 29 minutes to say that.

1245
01:21:07,809 --> 01:21:10,107
Don't worry, l'll collect
the bumper from Subhash, okay?

1246
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:16,484
l want to marry you.

1247
01:21:20,055 --> 01:21:21,079
What...
- No.

1248
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:23,350
What are you saying?

1249
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:27,195
l want to kiss you lip-to-lip.

1250
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:29,455
Are you crazy?

1251
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:30,462
What's he blabbering.

1252
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:31,896
l'll tell you.

1253
01:21:32,968 --> 01:21:34,993
l knew he couldn't say it.

1254
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:37,495
Actually, brother...

1255
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:41,071
...we really love each other.

1256
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:43,034
Really?
- Yes.

1257
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:47,039
And l didn't want you to
find this out from someone else.

1258
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,978
l wouldn't like it.

1259
01:21:50,085 --> 01:21:53,714
Raj...Veer isn't fooling
around this time..

1260
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:56,480
He's found the right girl this time.

1261
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:57,853
Yes, she's the right call-girl.

1262
01:21:57,993 --> 01:21:59,085
Oh Anwar...

1263
01:21:59,261 --> 01:22:01,058
l am...
- Really sorry.

1264
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,591
Actually l would like
to meet your family.

1265
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:05,589
Let me know if they're free tomorrow.

1266
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,065
l'll come over.
- Okay.

1267
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:15,741
Sir...madam will come
down in two minutes.

1268
01:22:15,911 --> 01:22:17,469
Would you like some tea or coffee?

1269
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,146
No. This is fine, thank you

1270
01:22:19,247 --> 01:22:20,612
Okay, sir.

1271
01:22:26,188 --> 01:22:27,655
l am sorry,
l think you are...

1272
01:23:04,759 --> 01:23:06,852
After coming to know
that you're Veer's brother...

1273
01:23:06,962 --> 01:23:09,089
...l won't let lshita meet Veer again.

1274
01:23:10,765 --> 01:23:12,255
You were mistaken, Meera.

1275
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,061
l wanted to tell you the truth.

1276
01:23:14,202 --> 01:23:15,999
But until then...
you were already gone.

1277
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:20,173
You only broke my trust, Kaali.

1278
01:23:21,276 --> 01:23:23,471
l spared your life
today for lshita's sake.

1279
01:23:23,945 --> 01:23:26,140
But if you come back here again,
l will kill you.

1280
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:35,320
'Dear...
- Yes.'

1281
01:23:36,324 --> 01:23:38,155
'Dear...you've managed to convince me.'

1282
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:43,163
'But...l know your
stubborn father too well.'

1283
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:45,231
'He will never agree
to this relationship.'

1284
01:23:48,703 --> 01:23:49,670
'l will convince him.'

1285
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:02,477
Fine...

1286
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:05,478
...l am ready to meet them.

1287
01:24:07,122 --> 01:24:08,749
Thank you so much, dad.

1288
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:13,618
l can tolerate anything...
but not your sad face.

1289
01:24:14,696 --> 01:24:16,425
Thank you.

1290
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:20,933
Malik sir, what have you done?

1291
01:24:21,469 --> 01:24:24,063
You're going to bow down before
that Randhir for your daughter's sake.

1292
01:24:24,472 --> 01:24:26,497
You didn't get it, Raghav.

1293
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,772
l can bow my head down
before my enemies for Meera...

1294
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:32,773
...but l cannot kneel in front of them.

1295
01:24:34,015 --> 01:24:37,951
lt's time to end this enmity forever.

1296
01:24:56,204 --> 01:24:57,728
l've often seen and heard...

1297
01:24:58,073 --> 01:25:02,032
...that years of friendship
one day turns into a relationship.

1298
01:25:02,911 --> 01:25:05,607
But Malik, this is the first time...

1299
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,739
...when an old enmity is
turning into a relationship.

1300
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:13,917
There's another way
to end the enmity, Randhir.

1301
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:16,423
Kill the enemy.

1302
01:25:18,193 --> 01:25:18,852
Where's Meera?

1303
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:23,294
You see, Kaali...
Meera loves you a lot.

1304
01:25:23,632 --> 01:25:27,796
She couldn't have seen
you and your father die.

1305
01:26:15,283 --> 01:26:18,741
Meera...Kaali and his
father have deceived us.

1306
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:21,045
They have attacked us.

1307
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:34,290
Dad!

1308
01:27:41,236 --> 01:27:42,203
Dad!

1309
01:29:31,112 --> 01:29:33,137
Try to understand, Meera.

1310
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:36,846
Randhir Bakshi's men won't
stay quiet after what happened.

1311
01:29:37,552 --> 01:29:39,611
lf not yourself,
then Think about lshita.

1312
01:29:39,821 --> 01:29:43,052
Think about how all this
will affect her when she finds out.

1313
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:45,989
You're like a sister to me, Meera.

1314
01:29:46,628 --> 01:29:47,993
Listen to me.

1315
01:29:49,063 --> 01:29:51,224
Take lshita far away from here.

1316
01:29:51,332 --> 01:29:53,493
And start a new life.

1317
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:56,966
We'll always protect you.

1318
01:29:59,173 --> 01:30:02,074
Meera has gone far away.

1319
01:30:04,746 --> 01:30:07,078
No one knows where.

1320
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:11,685
But l want to see Meera at any cost.

1321
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,154
l must tell her what happened there.

1322
01:30:14,255 --> 01:30:17,190
Kaali, l am not too intelligent.

1323
01:30:17,559 --> 01:30:20,528
But all this bloodshed
has taught me one thing.

1324
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:23,163
There's no meaning to this life.

1325
01:30:23,565 --> 01:30:27,433
lt's best if you forget
everything...and think about Veer.

1326
01:30:27,869 --> 01:30:29,234
Let's go together...

1327
01:30:29,571 --> 01:30:32,005
We'll start a new life. Right?

1328
01:30:58,866 --> 01:31:00,493
lt's hard to believe...

1329
01:31:01,436 --> 01:31:06,271
...that fate's repeating
the same story 15 years later.

1330
01:31:08,076 --> 01:31:11,068
Seems like we're back
to square one .

1331
01:31:11,312 --> 01:31:11,971
Yeah, Raj.

1332
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,809
There are many other
Countries in the world...

1333
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:15,780
...other than lndia and Bulgaria.

1334
01:31:15,883 --> 01:31:19,011
But...they had to open
a hotel at this place.

1335
01:31:20,288 --> 01:31:23,689
All these years l
hid this truth from Veer...

1336
01:31:25,259 --> 01:31:27,625
...and he shouldn't find out now either.

1337
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:31,425
We must stop Veer at any cost.

1338
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,092
And anyway...Meera...

1339
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,103
Will never agree to this relation.

1340
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:38,866
But l want to know...

1341
01:31:39,107 --> 01:31:40,540
...what's the reason
behind your rejection.

1342
01:31:40,675 --> 01:31:42,233
lt's a big one, that's it.

1343
01:31:42,477 --> 01:31:44,911
l do not want any more discussion
over this, lshu

1344
01:31:45,046 --> 01:31:45,569
Forget him.

1345
01:31:45,713 --> 01:31:46,611
But why?

1346
01:31:46,748 --> 01:31:48,739
What happened between
lshita's sister and you...

1347
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:50,747
...that you said no.

1348
01:31:51,052 --> 01:31:53,680
l already told you...
you won't ask any more questions.

1349
01:31:53,788 --> 01:31:55,312
There's some reason.
- Brother...

1350
01:31:55,423 --> 01:31:58,915
Veer! There's a reason.

1351
01:32:05,099 --> 01:32:07,761
lt's a serious matter.
- But what is the matter.

1352
01:32:08,036 --> 01:32:09,560
Look Sid, it's clear that...

1353
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:11,604
...Raj brother knows Meera, otherwise...

1354
01:32:11,806 --> 01:32:13,671
...what can be the reason to say no.

1355
01:32:14,242 --> 01:32:16,767
Who knows about your brother's past?
- brother knows.

1356
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:17,810
The answer's correct...

1357
01:32:17,912 --> 01:32:19,004
...but the direction is wrong.

1358
01:32:19,113 --> 01:32:21,138
the person who knows about
your brother's past...

1359
01:32:22,917 --> 01:32:24,179
...is my brother!

1360
01:32:24,352 --> 01:32:25,478
Peter.

1361
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,451
Feed him something special today
and don't charge him.

1362
01:32:27,555 --> 01:32:29,523
Come on.
- l said l don't know.

1363
01:32:29,691 --> 01:32:31,682
Now go away,
l've a lot of customers to attend to.

1364
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,491
Yogesh...are you going
to order something...

1365
01:32:33,628 --> 01:32:34,890
...or take this TV home.

1366
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:36,428
l'll place my order in five minutes.

1367
01:32:36,564 --> 01:32:38,794
You definitely know something.
You must tell me today.

1368
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,491
What?

1369
01:32:39,634 --> 01:32:41,898
l won't budge until you don't tell me.

1370
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:44,028
Brother Shakti, please say something.

1371
01:32:45,106 --> 01:32:47,506
Anwar brother...please
tell us their story.

1372
01:32:47,742 --> 01:32:50,711
No...Anwar brother, for my sake...
please tell us.

1373
01:32:50,912 --> 01:32:52,209
Don't do this.

1374
01:32:54,315 --> 01:32:55,714
Their story?

1375
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:58,451
They were thieves.
- Anwar!

1376
01:32:58,553 --> 01:32:59,645
Thieves?
- Thieves?

1377
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:01,212
Anwar!

1378
01:33:02,023 --> 01:33:04,992
He means...they stole
each other's heart.

1379
01:33:05,326 --> 01:33:07,794
Raj and Meera had an affair.

1380
01:33:07,895 --> 01:33:10,090
Brother, please tell
us from the beginning. - Yes.

1381
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:13,133
Your brother's real
name was never Raj. - Anwar!

1382
01:33:13,634 --> 01:33:16,364
He means...his real name was...

1383
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:17,233
Ramlal.

1384
01:33:17,438 --> 01:33:18,962
Ramlal!
- Ramlal?

1385
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,971
And he loved bashing...

1386
01:33:21,175 --> 01:33:25,236
He means he loved cleaning clothes.

1387
01:33:25,513 --> 01:33:26,980
Why?
- Because Ramlal was a washerman.

1388
01:33:27,081 --> 01:33:27,979
Brother was a washerman.

1389
01:33:28,082 --> 01:33:30,550
Then lshita's sister
must have a real name too.

1390
01:33:30,718 --> 01:33:33,084
lshita's sister's real name...

1391
01:33:35,089 --> 01:33:36,647
Pogo!
- Pogo?

1392
01:33:37,358 --> 01:33:38,916
Ramlal and Pogo...

1393
01:33:39,026 --> 01:33:41,153
How did they meet?
- Meet...how?

1394
01:33:44,031 --> 01:33:45,692
One day Pogo was walking all alone...

1395
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:47,164
...when some goons came after her.

1396
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:49,200
That's when Ramlal
slammed them to the ground.

1397
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:51,565
How can brother slam anyone...
- He was a washerman...

1398
01:33:51,672 --> 01:33:52,798
So he slammed them on the ground.

1399
01:33:52,974 --> 01:33:55,943
Then? - Then Pogo met
him every morning for tea.

1400
01:33:56,043 --> 01:33:57,408
Then?
- Then...

1401
01:33:58,112 --> 01:33:59,170
They would meet in
the evening in toilets.

1402
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,804
Why the toilet?

1403
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:02,775
Hand pump.
- Yeah.

1404
01:34:02,917 --> 01:34:04,316
Because Ramlal would wash his clothes...

1405
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:05,850
...at the hand pump which
was below Pogo's toilet.

1406
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:08,285
lf their love was so pumped up...

1407
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:10,116
...then how did it turn into hatred?

1408
01:34:10,191 --> 01:34:11,522
Hatred...

1409
01:34:13,127 --> 01:34:14,094
Gold is my God.

1410
01:34:14,328 --> 01:34:17,661
Pogo loved diamonds,
jewels, gold and silver.

1411
01:34:17,832 --> 01:34:19,891
Their love story was somewhat like...

1412
01:34:20,134 --> 01:34:21,726
'Khana Khazana' (Cookery Show).

1413
01:34:21,869 --> 01:34:23,336
'Khana Khazana'...
what are you saying?

1414
01:34:23,437 --> 01:34:25,337
Because Ramlal could
barely manage a square meal...

1415
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:27,066
...and Pogo was looking for treasure.

1416
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,540
Then? - And one day...
tired of all the arguments...

1417
01:34:29,644 --> 01:34:32,408
...your brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).

1418
01:34:32,513 --> 01:34:33,912
Brother turned into a...
'Chakka' (Eunuch)...How's this?

1419
01:34:34,048 --> 01:34:35,982
He means to say...

1420
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:37,348
Yes, brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).

1421
01:34:37,451 --> 01:34:38,679
brother turned into
a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch) again.

1422
01:34:38,853 --> 01:34:41,287
Veer, this is why he never got married.
- You shut up.

1423
01:34:41,455 --> 01:34:43,355
l mean Ramlal was devastated...

1424
01:34:43,457 --> 01:34:45,482
...because he couldn't
fulfill Pogo's demands.

1425
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:46,684
And in between those two...

1426
01:34:46,861 --> 01:34:47,919
'Daraar' (Void).

1427
01:34:48,095 --> 01:34:48,993
'Judaai' (Separation).

1428
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:50,297
'Dushmani' (Enmity).

1429
01:34:50,464 --> 01:34:51,260
'Tashan' (Style).

1430
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:52,591
Oh my, God.

1431
01:34:52,733 --> 01:34:55,793
''Oh my, God'' ln between them?
- lt's just an expression.

1432
01:34:56,003 --> 01:34:58,699
Don't people say ''Oh my,
God'' when someone separates.

1433
01:34:58,973 --> 01:35:01,840
Peter...cut-off that customer's finger.

1434
01:35:02,043 --> 01:35:04,637
Who keeps pressing
the remote so frequently?

1435
01:35:06,147 --> 01:35:07,637
Brother Shakti, l remember...

1436
01:35:07,849 --> 01:35:10,875
...when dad and brother used
to come meet me at the hostel...

1437
01:35:11,052 --> 01:35:12,644
...they always wore good clothes...

1438
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:14,448
...and came in big cars, we were rich.

1439
01:35:14,822 --> 01:35:17,086
Because your brother was a washerman.

1440
01:35:17,258 --> 01:35:19,419
He used to wear his
customer's clothes.

1441
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,221
And your dad was a mechanic.

1442
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:23,420
He would drive his customer's car.

1443
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:24,826
Just like you do.

1444
01:35:25,066 --> 01:35:26,590
You're a mechanic as well.

1445
01:35:26,701 --> 01:35:29,067
Go and fix cars...go on!

1446
01:35:29,337 --> 01:35:30,099
Go!

1447
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:31,238
Brother...

1448
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:33,031
Was our father a waiter or...

1449
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,608
You get lost to...come on, get out.

1450
01:35:35,943 --> 01:35:39,902
Such an emotional story.

1451
01:35:40,648 --> 01:35:41,979
This is wrong.

1452
01:35:43,284 --> 01:35:44,808
- Anwar brother...

1453
01:35:46,354 --> 01:35:48,914
Who asked you to open your mouth?

1454
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:52,186
Shakti, The children made me emotional.

1455
01:35:53,461 --> 01:35:54,485
Your emotion...

1456
01:35:55,663 --> 01:35:59,394
That's all fine,
but why didn't you two get married?

1457
01:36:01,302 --> 01:36:02,269
Come here.

1458
01:36:03,671 --> 01:36:07,300
You...take that...
so many questions.

1459
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:09,574
Don't hit.
l just asked a question.

1460
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:12,406
Because we didn't
want to become fathers.

1461
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:26,217
See...he's still washing
everyone's clothes.

1462
01:36:28,663 --> 01:36:29,925
Ramlal!

1463
01:36:33,434 --> 01:36:34,799
Hey Ramlal?

1464
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:43,607
What are you doing?

1465
01:36:43,945 --> 01:36:44,969
What are you two doing?

1466
01:36:45,146 --> 01:36:46,477
Let go of me, please...
what happened?

1467
01:36:47,448 --> 01:36:51,976
Brother Shakti and Anwar
told us everything about your past.

1468
01:36:53,788 --> 01:36:56,086
Oh... Everything?

1469
01:36:57,792 --> 01:37:01,922
Brother...you would use these
hands to wipe them, isn't it?

1470
01:37:02,496 --> 01:37:03,485
Whose?

1471
01:37:05,466 --> 01:37:08,401
Brother, why are you so worried?
- No, l am not worried.

1472
01:37:08,502 --> 01:37:10,129
You weren't a beggar.

1473
01:37:10,404 --> 01:37:12,201
You were a washerman.

1474
01:37:12,974 --> 01:37:14,202
Washerman!?

1475
01:37:14,809 --> 01:37:16,333
l am washerman?

1476
01:37:16,477 --> 01:37:20,573
Brother...we know everything
about Ramlal and Pogo.

1477
01:37:20,982 --> 01:37:21,949
Ramlal?

1478
01:37:22,316 --> 01:37:22,873
Who?

1479
01:37:23,417 --> 01:37:24,111
Pogo?

1480
01:37:24,618 --> 01:37:26,916
Give me this.
Now we'll do all this.

1481
01:37:27,088 --> 01:37:27,816
Okay.

1482
01:37:27,955 --> 01:37:29,081
You Go!

1483
01:37:30,057 --> 01:37:31,149
Okay, okay...

1484
01:37:33,127 --> 01:37:34,355
Bye, Ramlal.

1485
01:37:35,463 --> 01:37:38,591
Ramlal? Pogo? Washerman?

1486
01:37:38,933 --> 01:37:41,629
Raj, you said Veer should
never learn about the truth.

1487
01:37:41,769 --> 01:37:45,068
But l never said that
You should turn me into Ramlal.

1488
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:47,270
We were Mafia, man.
- Yeah, that's right

1489
01:37:47,441 --> 01:37:49,636
But they just pounced
on us...made us swear too...

1490
01:37:49,777 --> 01:37:50,573
What else could we do?

1491
01:37:50,678 --> 01:37:52,373
You could've said you don't know.
Don't know.

1492
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,742
Why don't we know?

1493
01:37:53,848 --> 01:37:55,179
We've been together for so long.

1494
01:37:55,282 --> 01:37:57,182
And Raj... even we have some honor.
lsn't it brother?

1495
01:37:57,318 --> 01:37:59,377
Ohh...that's why you tarnished mine.

1496
01:37:59,487 --> 01:38:02,251
Look at my personality,
Do l look like Ramlal from any angle?

1497
01:38:02,456 --> 01:38:04,083
Kaali...sorry...

1498
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:06,589
Why are you getting so furious?

1499
01:38:06,827 --> 01:38:08,385
Because l know Veer too well.

1500
01:38:08,496 --> 01:38:09,588
He won't stay quiet.

1501
01:38:09,797 --> 01:38:13,324
He'll do something worse
than the story you just cooked up.

1502
01:38:14,802 --> 01:38:15,996
And who's Pogo?

1503
01:38:16,137 --> 01:38:17,001
Pogo?

1504
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:18,196
My Sister's name was Pogo?

1505
01:38:18,305 --> 01:38:19,363
l don't believe this story.

1506
01:38:19,473 --> 01:38:21,873
And my sister left
your brother for money.

1507
01:38:21,976 --> 01:38:24,001
How can this be true?
- lshu, l heard this...

1508
01:38:24,111 --> 01:38:25,510
...from one of brother's old friend.

1509
01:38:25,613 --> 01:38:27,376
His...brother.

1510
01:38:27,648 --> 01:38:29,013
lt's all true.

1511
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,883
What about us now?

1512
01:38:31,152 --> 01:38:34,781
Do one thing ...why don't you
two disappear for a few days.

1513
01:38:35,056 --> 01:38:37,251
Who knows...maybe out of worry
Ramlal and Pogo melt?

1514
01:38:37,425 --> 01:38:39,620
Jenny...they're not some
ice-cream that will melt.

1515
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,422
l say that you two should
run away and get married.

1516
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:46,458
No...my sister's done a lot for me.

1517
01:38:46,967 --> 01:38:48,366
l cannot hurt her like this.

1518
01:38:48,569 --> 01:38:50,730
Even l can't do this
with brother either.

1519
01:38:52,173 --> 01:38:53,105
Hold on.

1520
01:38:53,441 --> 01:38:58,674
lshu...why didn't my brother and your
sister ever get married to someone else?

1521
01:38:58,846 --> 01:38:59,744
Why?

1522
01:39:00,147 --> 01:39:02,775
Because...they haven't
forgotten their memories...

1523
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:04,918
...and their daily one-night stands.

1524
01:39:05,019 --> 01:39:06,611
Veer...you're talking about my sister.

1525
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,278
Don't get into the details...
come to the point.

1526
01:39:08,456 --> 01:39:10,356
lf they did love each other...

1527
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:12,483
...then how about we
rekindle that love again?

1528
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,184
And patch them up.

1529
01:39:14,395 --> 01:39:15,259
What do you say?

1530
01:39:15,396 --> 01:39:17,762
That can solve our problems.
- Exactly.

1531
01:39:17,932 --> 01:39:19,422
But how do we patch things up?

1532
01:39:19,567 --> 01:39:20,727
How?

1533
01:39:21,268 --> 01:39:22,929
Only God knows that.

1534
01:39:52,433 --> 01:39:55,402
Patrick, l've heard some new
restaurant has opened up in Panjim.

1535
01:39:55,669 --> 01:39:57,660
Yes, the owner is
some woman called Meera.

1536
01:39:57,771 --> 01:40:01,229
So go talk to her...and our stuff..

1537
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:06,407
Dude...where's my car.

1538
01:40:06,514 --> 01:40:07,481
There...

1539
01:40:08,082 --> 01:40:09,947
Where's my car?

1540
01:40:10,818 --> 01:40:13,844
Patrick, it had drugs worth millions.

1541
01:40:14,021 --> 01:40:14,988
What?

1542
01:40:15,089 --> 01:40:15,817
Veer...

1543
01:40:16,624 --> 01:40:20,082
l got a superb idea to get
Ramlal and Pogo back together.

1544
01:40:20,227 --> 01:40:20,852
What?

1545
01:40:20,961 --> 01:40:22,656
We'll hire some goons...

1546
01:40:22,763 --> 01:40:24,196
...and tell them to chase Pogo.

1547
01:40:24,298 --> 01:40:26,630
The hero makes a dynamic entry...

1548
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,768
...when the villains
chasing the heroine.

1549
01:40:28,936 --> 01:40:30,198
Villain's pack up...

1550
01:40:30,371 --> 01:40:32,430
...and the hero-heroine will patch-up.

1551
01:40:32,606 --> 01:40:33,573
What patch up?

1552
01:40:33,674 --> 01:40:36,939
What an ancient idea
to rekindle old love, Sid.

1553
01:40:37,077 --> 01:40:41,104
Veer...the oldest wine
is the most intoxicating one.

1554
01:40:41,282 --> 01:40:43,250
Just say yes...and then see...

1555
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:46,113
l'm sure you'll say...
''What a plan''.

1556
01:40:48,923 --> 01:40:51,255
Who will pose as the goon?
- We'll find someone.

1557
01:40:55,829 --> 01:40:57,729
That's King's car.

1558
01:40:58,432 --> 01:41:00,832
Why are you driving
around in King's car?

1559
01:41:01,202 --> 01:41:03,466
l didn't know it was
King's car when l stole it.

1560
01:41:03,637 --> 01:41:05,605
You mean you stole it.
- That too King's car.

1561
01:41:05,706 --> 01:41:08,869
Exactly...what will King
do when he finds out?

1562
01:41:09,009 --> 01:41:10,670
So change its color...

1563
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:12,779
...so l can sell it to someone in Goa.

1564
01:41:12,913 --> 01:41:15,848
Mani, you know l will never
help you with stolen stuff.

1565
01:41:16,016 --> 01:41:17,506
But the guy whose car you stole...

1566
01:41:17,651 --> 01:41:19,551
...l've got a score
to settle with him too.

1567
01:41:21,055 --> 01:41:23,023
But first we must hide
this car from brother Raj.

1568
01:41:23,157 --> 01:41:24,920
Tavde...
- Yes, brother.

1569
01:41:25,259 --> 01:41:27,227
Hide the car...and
don't tell brother Raj.

1570
01:41:27,361 --> 01:41:28,089
You want me to lie to Raj sir?

1571
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:30,025
How about l tell him
you've got a girl. Get lost

1572
01:41:30,164 --> 01:41:31,631
Pinto, come on.

1573
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:37,599
l will never forget
what you two have done for me.

1574
01:41:37,805 --> 01:41:39,773
Look, l've said this to brother Raj...

1575
01:41:39,907 --> 01:41:41,101
...and l'm saying it again to you.

1576
01:41:41,275 --> 01:41:44,244
lf there's anything l can do for you...

1577
01:41:44,411 --> 01:41:45,275
...just let me know.

1578
01:41:45,412 --> 01:41:48,939
l'll stand
by you head over heels.

1579
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:52,780
Mani bhai, we do need help.
- Say it!

1580
01:41:52,953 --> 01:41:55,786
Okay. You need to
pretend as a goon for us.

1581
01:41:55,923 --> 01:41:56,719
Goon?

1582
01:41:56,857 --> 01:41:59,087
Brother Raj's love story is stuck.

1583
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:00,022
Huh!

1584
01:42:00,127 --> 01:42:01,719
Hero and Heroine will patch-up...

1585
01:42:01,862 --> 01:42:04,558
...when you trouble
the girl as the villain.

1586
01:42:04,765 --> 01:42:05,959
Will you, Mani bhai.?

1587
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:10,127
l can even give up
my life for brother Raj.

1588
01:42:11,238 --> 01:42:13,729
Name, place,
animal, thing...just name it.

1589
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:14,967
Say it!

1590
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:16,838
Mani bhai, just handle it.

1591
01:42:16,944 --> 01:42:18,468
Everything lies in your hands now.

1592
01:42:18,612 --> 01:42:19,601
Don't mess it up.

1593
01:42:20,681 --> 01:42:22,615
Look Veer, she's coming.

1594
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:26,052
All the best. - All the best...
careful with the loin-cloth!

1595
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:38,393
Do you want to die? Get out of the way.

1596
01:42:38,565 --> 01:42:41,500
Just one question.
- What?

1597
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:45,002
ls there a Chintu in your home?
- No.

1598
01:42:45,105 --> 01:42:46,072
That's it...

1599
01:42:46,307 --> 01:42:51,745
Give me one chance...
and you'll get a Chintu.

1600
01:42:57,818 --> 01:42:58,716
What a plan.

1601
01:42:58,852 --> 01:43:01,116
And according to the time Raj
will be coming through any minute.

1602
01:43:01,288 --> 01:43:06,658
Now you'll say
''What are your intentions''.

1603
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,858
And l'll say...

1604
01:43:10,164 --> 01:43:14,260
Next you'll say
''Don't come any closer''.

1605
01:43:14,435 --> 01:43:15,629
l'll say...

1606
01:43:17,838 --> 01:43:20,966
Then you'll say ''Help''.

1607
01:43:21,275 --> 01:43:23,766
And l'll say ''Scream''.

1608
01:43:24,945 --> 01:43:28,779
But no one will come to save you.

1609
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:31,782
Mani's acting so well.

1610
01:43:31,985 --> 01:43:33,077
What a plan.

1611
01:43:33,654 --> 01:43:35,815
And then you'll come closer.

1612
01:43:36,256 --> 01:43:36,984
Yes.

1613
01:43:37,157 --> 01:43:39,022
And hold my hand tightly.

1614
01:43:39,159 --> 01:43:39,989
Yes!

1615
01:43:40,094 --> 01:43:41,959
That's when you'll realize...

1616
01:43:42,096 --> 01:43:44,394
...there's actually no one to help...

1617
01:43:44,565 --> 01:43:46,760
No one. No one. Correct!

1618
01:43:47,301 --> 01:43:47,892
You!

1619
01:43:48,001 --> 01:43:48,899
Me.

1620
01:43:54,808 --> 01:43:56,173
What are you taking out?

1621
01:43:57,978 --> 01:43:59,673
This is cheating.

1622
01:44:00,814 --> 01:44:02,543
l don't hit women.

1623
01:44:04,084 --> 01:44:05,779
l spare you because you're a woman.

1624
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:08,120
Hit like a woman...

1625
01:44:08,389 --> 01:44:10,050
Why are you hitting like a man?

1626
01:44:11,425 --> 01:44:12,790
She's letting him have it!

1627
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:14,921
Help me!

1628
01:44:15,229 --> 01:44:16,856
Where are you going?

1629
01:44:24,538 --> 01:44:28,065
Pogo channel turned into WWF.

1630
01:44:28,442 --> 01:44:33,209
She smashed me up...

1631
01:44:33,847 --> 01:44:39,808
She smashed me up...
Even these two abandoned me.

1632
01:44:39,987 --> 01:44:41,420
Seriously, this is the limit guys.

1633
01:44:41,855 --> 01:44:43,152
ls this the way?

1634
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:44,985
And who comes up with such ideas?
- He does.

1635
01:44:45,659 --> 01:44:47,024
Get sister in trouble...
brother will save her...

1636
01:44:47,194 --> 01:44:48,161
...and those two will fall in love.

1637
01:44:48,295 --> 01:44:49,262
That's the limit.

1638
01:44:49,396 --> 01:44:51,455
Have you lost your mind, Veer?

1639
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:52,923
Brother...
- Veer...

1640
01:44:53,967 --> 01:44:55,161
And what do you guys think...

1641
01:44:55,302 --> 01:44:56,963
...by doing this, she ..

1642
01:44:59,406 --> 01:45:01,101
That relation is over.

1643
01:45:01,942 --> 01:45:02,931
You will gain nothing.

1644
01:45:03,177 --> 01:45:04,109
There's no point.

1645
01:45:04,278 --> 01:45:06,007
Veer...all this doesn't look good.

1646
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:08,407
Don't be such a fool.
Everything is over.

1647
01:45:08,515 --> 01:45:10,380
How can you say that?

1648
01:45:12,619 --> 01:45:15,782
Brother...
firstly l am not ready to believe...

1649
01:45:15,923 --> 01:45:17,857
...that sister left you for money.

1650
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:20,422
And even if she did...

1651
01:45:21,562 --> 01:45:23,723
...then why didn't
she marry someone else?

1652
01:45:26,567 --> 01:45:29,400
You're on the right track...
bombard him with another one.

1653
01:45:30,237 --> 01:45:33,604
Why didn't she make anyone
else her life-partner?

1654
01:45:35,175 --> 01:45:36,540
Go on. Go on.

1655
01:45:36,643 --> 01:45:38,634
And even brother didn't
marry anyone else, right?

1656
01:45:38,912 --> 01:45:40,402
Yes, why?

1657
01:45:40,547 --> 01:45:43,539
Even you didn't find
anyone else for yourself.

1658
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:47,416
You never even went on a three
night-four day tour with some girl.

1659
01:45:48,956 --> 01:45:52,653
Brother Raj...only you
know what's in your heart.

1660
01:45:53,594 --> 01:45:56,654
But l've understood
what's in sister's heart.

1661
01:45:56,997 --> 01:46:00,660
Regardless of what
happened between you two...

1662
01:46:00,968 --> 01:46:03,459
...she still hasn't
forgotten her first love.

1663
01:46:10,077 --> 01:46:11,339
Veer, deliver the car.

1664
01:46:17,551 --> 01:46:19,041
Brother's melting.

1665
01:46:19,219 --> 01:46:22,279
Brother, l've another plan.

1666
01:46:22,623 --> 01:46:24,648
Mani bhai...
- Shut up!

1667
01:46:25,626 --> 01:46:27,321
l've to attend a meeting.

1668
01:46:27,461 --> 01:46:29,861
Wrap up everything
here and come home. Okay thanks.

1669
01:46:30,163 --> 01:46:31,653
Bye.
- Bye.

1670
01:46:39,673 --> 01:46:42,164
This car will definitely
break-down before it reaches Panjim.

1671
01:46:42,409 --> 01:46:44,707
And like every day,
brother will pass-by.

1672
01:46:44,811 --> 01:46:46,676
lshita, something will
definitely happen today.

1673
01:47:57,918 --> 01:48:02,946
''Walk with me...in every lifetime.''

1674
01:48:03,457 --> 01:48:08,417
''Promise me...
you'll come back to me right here''

1675
01:48:08,595 --> 01:48:13,726
''We're one soul...
even if we're two bodies.''

1676
01:48:14,134 --> 01:48:19,094
''Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

1677
01:48:19,406 --> 01:48:24,605
''You're my dawn...
and you're my twilight.''

1678
01:48:25,479 --> 01:48:30,007
''You're the pain...
and you're the comfort.''

1679
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:35,415
''There's only one thing
l ever pray for in my mind.''

1680
01:48:35,889 --> 01:48:40,917
''Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

1681
01:48:57,778 --> 01:49:02,806
''Always be mine...
don't ever say...

1682
01:49:03,684 --> 01:49:08,644
''Both my world lie in your arms.''

1683
01:49:09,122 --> 01:49:13,889
''My heaven is wherever you are.''

1684
01:49:14,461 --> 01:49:19,398
''Desire's are burning
in both our hearts.''

1685
01:49:19,966 --> 01:49:24,596
''l wish my prayers
are never unanswered.''

1686
01:49:24,771 --> 01:49:29,970
''You're my desire, l am your love.''

1687
01:49:30,277 --> 01:49:35,874
''You're my poem...l am your music.''

1688
01:49:36,149 --> 01:49:41,143
''You...You...
You're the one l crave for.''

1689
01:49:41,555 --> 01:49:46,254
''Become the intoxication in my veins
and keep flowing.

1690
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:51,657
''Repay my love in this way.''

1691
01:49:52,265 --> 01:49:58,067
''Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

1692
01:50:00,273 --> 01:50:02,764
''...goodbye.''

1693
01:50:42,716 --> 01:50:44,741
Veer, superb buddy.

1694
01:50:44,885 --> 01:50:47,080
You've done an amazing job.

1695
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,083
You completely changed
the look of the car.

1696
01:50:49,222 --> 01:50:52,680
Even King can never recognize it.

1697
01:50:53,727 --> 01:50:55,388
Veer, what's wrong?

1698
01:50:55,629 --> 01:50:57,290
Why are you in a bad mood?

1699
01:50:58,465 --> 01:50:59,989
No matter how hard we try...

1700
01:51:00,066 --> 01:51:02,057
...Pogo and brother's
love story doesn't pick up.

1701
01:51:02,169 --> 01:51:04,194
l don't know what to do now.

1702
01:51:04,337 --> 01:51:07,306
Veer...l do have an idea.

1703
01:51:07,374 --> 01:51:09,706
No more idea. No, buddy no..
- lt's sure shot, please.

1704
01:51:09,776 --> 01:51:11,607
At least hear me out. Hear me out.

1705
01:51:11,678 --> 01:51:14,841
What if we rekindle their passion?

1706
01:51:15,182 --> 01:51:16,774
Passion? How?

1707
01:51:16,983 --> 01:51:18,974
There's a new film playing
in Edward's Theatre.

1708
01:51:19,186 --> 01:51:21,450
Let's buy corner
seat tickets for them.

1709
01:51:21,588 --> 01:51:22,680
They'll watch the film together...

1710
01:51:22,789 --> 01:51:24,689
...and rekindle their passion.

1711
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:27,286
What film? - 'Tamboo Mein Dhoom-Dham'
(lndian C-grade film).

1712
01:51:27,527 --> 01:51:29,085
Come here. Come here.

1713
01:51:29,596 --> 01:51:31,188
You and your pervert ideas.

1714
01:51:31,431 --> 01:51:33,023
Pinto, wrap the boot.

1715
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:35,862
lt's a nice film. l've seen it myself.

1716
01:51:37,304 --> 01:51:39,033
Brother, there's a bag in here.

1717
01:51:42,542 --> 01:51:44,533
Whose bag is this?

1718
01:51:45,478 --> 01:51:47,309
l guess it Mani bhai's.

1719
01:51:47,714 --> 01:51:49,739
This isn't my bag.
- What?

1720
01:51:49,883 --> 01:51:52,681
Then whose bag is it?
- l don't know.

1721
01:51:52,819 --> 01:51:53,808
Open it.

1722
01:51:56,289 --> 01:51:58,189
Oh God...drugs!

1723
01:51:58,291 --> 01:52:01,658
Drugs! This is
definitely King's stuff.

1724
01:52:01,728 --> 01:52:03,389
What do we do with it now?

1725
01:52:04,664 --> 01:52:06,529
lf these drugs get out in the market...

1726
01:52:06,733 --> 01:52:08,894
...there's no telling how
many will fall prey to it.

1727
01:52:09,069 --> 01:52:10,661
Then what do we do it.

1728
01:52:13,406 --> 01:52:14,395
Let's burn it.

1729
01:52:14,507 --> 01:52:18,443
These drugs were going
to ruin the entire youth.

1730
01:52:18,912 --> 01:52:23,815
King...l really enjoyed
burning your stuff.

1731
01:52:24,117 --> 01:52:27,177
l think Mani bhai is drunk.
- Drunk?

1732
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,548
He's completely over the top.

1733
01:52:28,688 --> 01:52:31,521
Mani bhai, control.
- What control?

1734
01:52:31,958 --> 01:52:33,926
Lose control!

1735
01:52:34,027 --> 01:52:35,995
Lose control!

1736
01:52:38,531 --> 01:52:39,998
What..

1737
01:52:43,436 --> 01:52:43,993
King!

1738
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:45,037
King!

1739
01:52:47,007 --> 01:52:48,497
What are you guys burning?

1740
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:51,608
What are you guys burning tell me?

1741
01:52:51,711 --> 01:52:54,839
We're burning the stuff from the car.
- What?

1742
01:52:55,482 --> 01:52:57,313
You see...once a month...

1743
01:52:57,484 --> 01:53:00,885
...we burn all the scrap
from the garage in a bonfire.

1744
01:53:01,454 --> 01:53:03,513
Sir...what are you doing here?

1745
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:07,685
My car's broken down.
- We'll fix it.

1746
01:53:11,264 --> 01:53:13,164
Yeah...
- lgnition.

1747
01:53:17,671 --> 01:53:18,660
What?

1748
01:53:19,673 --> 01:53:20,901
Why are you laughing?

1749
01:53:21,241 --> 01:53:26,406
He's warming his hands
on the ashes of his own stuff.

1750
01:53:26,846 --> 01:53:29,838
Shut up, Mani. You'll give us away.

1751
01:53:39,926 --> 01:53:41,450
Veer...he's gone.

1752
01:53:41,728 --> 01:53:42,854
Fix it quickly.

1753
01:53:55,709 --> 01:54:00,442
King...you're looking really smart.

1754
01:54:04,651 --> 01:54:05,743
Thank you.

1755
01:54:06,653 --> 01:54:08,484
But you would look smarter...

1756
01:54:08,555 --> 01:54:12,047
...with your father's favorite car.

1757
01:54:12,759 --> 01:54:14,920
Did you find the car?

1758
01:54:15,428 --> 01:54:17,055
You didn't, right?

1759
01:54:17,664 --> 01:54:20,394
King, don't mind...he's drunk.

1760
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:21,692
Mani...

1761
01:54:25,672 --> 01:54:30,837
King...was there something in the car?

1762
01:54:31,444 --> 01:54:33,275
You didn't find that either, did you?

1763
01:54:33,513 --> 01:54:36,243
Hey...show some manners.

1764
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:37,550
He's King.

1765
01:54:39,686 --> 01:54:42,177
King...is my Angel.

1766
01:54:46,593 --> 01:54:47,924
King...

1767
01:54:49,462 --> 01:54:51,692
...did you find Kaali?

1768
01:54:52,799 --> 01:54:54,767
You didn't find him either.

1769
01:54:55,935 --> 01:54:58,165
King...your car's fixed.

1770
01:55:05,545 --> 01:55:06,876
Come on.

1771
01:55:08,281 --> 01:55:10,078
Mani, what are you doing?

1772
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:11,640
Why do you drink so much?

1773
01:55:15,588 --> 01:55:18,148
Veer...Siddhu!

1774
01:55:19,459 --> 01:55:22,917
Did Ramlal and Pogo patch up?

1775
01:55:23,530 --> 01:55:25,122
They didn't either?

1776
01:55:42,782 --> 01:55:43,339
Get out!

1777
01:55:43,616 --> 01:55:45,811
We...work for King!

1778
01:55:45,985 --> 01:55:47,145
l said get out.

1779
01:55:54,928 --> 01:55:56,862
Joshua...that's Kaali!

1780
01:56:35,702 --> 01:56:36,669
What's the matter, Veer?

1781
01:56:36,803 --> 01:56:38,395
These days you've been
visiting the church quite often.

1782
01:56:38,805 --> 01:56:40,295
How did you get so religious?

1783
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:41,270
Yes, brother.

1784
01:56:41,407 --> 01:56:43,238
There are only two things
in our life that matters.

1785
01:56:43,376 --> 01:56:45,037
Car...and Sans-kar (Values).

1786
01:56:46,913 --> 01:56:48,710
Nice church, right?

1787
01:56:53,086 --> 01:56:55,179
Brother, l'll go get the candles.

1788
01:56:55,588 --> 01:56:58,022
Wait here,
sis...l'll go get the candles.

1789
01:57:16,176 --> 01:57:17,336
Are you following me?

1790
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:20,138
l came here with Veer.

1791
01:57:21,181 --> 01:57:21,875
Where is he?

1792
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:24,516
Raj my boy, you here.

1793
01:57:26,186 --> 01:57:29,280
And Joshua told me...
that you're Meera.

1794
01:57:30,056 --> 01:57:31,489
Let me introduce myself.

1795
01:57:31,691 --> 01:57:34,683
l am King... Charmed.

1796
01:57:35,061 --> 01:57:36,289
lt's a good thing we met...

1797
01:57:36,429 --> 01:57:38,397
l was thinking of
coming over to meet you.

1798
01:57:38,631 --> 01:57:41,031
Last night my men came to your shack...

1799
01:57:41,201 --> 01:57:43,669
...and suddenly Kaali dropped in.

1800
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:47,706
Do you know Kaali?

1801
01:57:48,575 --> 01:57:50,566
Because if you do...then tell me.

1802
01:57:50,777 --> 01:57:53,211
And l promise you my men
will never trouble you again.

1803
01:57:53,446 --> 01:57:55,846
Of course, will finish him.

1804
01:58:01,221 --> 01:58:03,189
Do you know Kaali?

1805
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,393
l don't know him!

1806
01:58:12,532 --> 01:58:15,330
Just once l lay my hand on Kaali...

1807
01:58:15,501 --> 01:58:19,528
You know what...l'll pray to
the Lord that you never find Kaali.

1808
01:58:20,006 --> 01:58:22,167
Who knows...what will happen...

1809
01:58:23,409 --> 01:58:25,070
To him...not you.

1810
01:58:25,211 --> 01:58:28,442
Yeah...Got to go, bro.
- Have a good day.

1811
01:58:38,925 --> 01:58:41,018
Oh my....

1812
01:58:43,863 --> 01:58:46,559
Veer...you did an amazing job.

1813
01:58:46,766 --> 01:58:49,030
You turned a landline
into a smartphone...

1814
01:58:49,202 --> 01:58:52,000
...and an old piece
of junk into lron Man.

1815
01:58:52,205 --> 01:58:53,832
You turned bat into Batman...

1816
01:58:54,007 --> 01:58:55,975
...and Spider into Spider' Man.

1817
01:58:56,376 --> 01:58:57,206
Oh my...

1818
01:58:57,310 --> 01:58:59,870
Blackberry at the bottom...
and Bappi Lahiri on top.

1819
01:59:00,213 --> 01:59:02,044
l'll sell this at
the rate of an airplane.

1820
01:59:02,215 --> 01:59:03,239
By the way...what's the
rate of airplanes nowadays?

1821
01:59:03,349 --> 01:59:06,250
Forget about airplanes
and just go sell this thing.

1822
01:59:06,386 --> 01:59:08,047
This is King's car.

1823
01:59:08,221 --> 01:59:10,917
lf he finds out...
- Then you'll disappear forever.

1824
01:59:11,024 --> 01:59:12,491
Oh... Correct.

1825
01:59:12,692 --> 01:59:14,489
Bravo my boy.

1826
01:59:14,594 --> 01:59:18,621
Keep this...Lux cozy...
Rupa's underwear.

1827
01:59:18,898 --> 01:59:19,922
Underwear.

1828
01:59:20,166 --> 01:59:22,191
Oscar bhai,
you look really happy today.

1829
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,357
What's the matter?

1830
01:59:23,536 --> 01:59:29,805
Bloody raincoat...l could've given
you any amount you had asked for.

1831
01:59:29,976 --> 01:59:30,738
Why?

1832
01:59:30,877 --> 01:59:32,970
Because my sister just told me...

1833
01:59:33,179 --> 01:59:35,010
...that she's in love with some boy.

1834
01:59:35,181 --> 01:59:37,706
Some boy...who owns a hotel.

1835
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:39,647
Ariel...and Harpic.

1836
01:59:39,752 --> 01:59:41,276
Yeah!

1837
01:59:41,487 --> 01:59:44,115
Tomorrow l am going to talk to his
family about their marriage.

1838
01:59:44,223 --> 01:59:45,986
And if it's fixed...

1839
01:59:46,192 --> 01:59:48,057
...then l am thinking
of presenting this...

1840
01:59:48,194 --> 01:59:50,958
...on their wedding.

1841
01:59:51,197 --> 01:59:52,459
Hold a second.

1842
01:59:52,732 --> 01:59:55,860
Should l present a gift?
Or gift a present?

1843
01:59:56,936 --> 01:59:57,834
lt's the same thing, Oscar bhai.

1844
01:59:57,937 --> 01:59:58,961
A gift is a gift after all...

1845
01:59:59,205 --> 02:00:01,730
Wow...you read my heart.

1846
02:00:01,874 --> 02:00:03,705
Mani you're just a honey.

1847
02:00:04,711 --> 02:00:06,508
Jenny's here, Siddhu.

1848
02:00:06,746 --> 02:00:07,735
Jenny?

1849
02:00:08,014 --> 02:00:10,175
Hi, hi...
- What's up, Jenny?

1850
02:00:10,283 --> 02:00:11,409
Jenny, you here?

1851
02:00:11,584 --> 02:00:13,484
You could've called.

1852
02:00:13,653 --> 02:00:14,881
Guess what?
- What?

1853
02:00:15,054 --> 02:00:17,249
l told my brother everything about us.

1854
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:19,358
And he's agreed to our marriage.
- What?

1855
02:00:19,525 --> 02:00:21,618
ln fact, he's come here to meet you.

1856
02:00:21,794 --> 02:00:22,920
What are you saying, Jenny?

1857
02:00:23,096 --> 02:00:26,554
Why are you still standing?
Where is he standing?

1858
02:00:26,666 --> 02:00:27,997
Brother-in-law.
- Siddhu.

1859
02:00:28,234 --> 02:00:29,792
Where are you brother-in-law?

1860
02:00:29,936 --> 02:00:32,598
Mona Lisa...

1861
02:00:33,106 --> 02:00:34,266
Oscar bhai.

1862
02:00:35,908 --> 02:00:38,342
What are you doing?
- What are you doing here?

1863
02:00:38,444 --> 02:00:40,708
l'm here to meet
my sister's boyfriend.

1864
02:00:40,913 --> 02:00:43,074
And l am here to meet
my girlfriend's brother.

1865
02:00:43,249 --> 02:00:44,944
Where is he? lntroduce me?

1866
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:46,582
He's the one.

1867
02:00:46,686 --> 02:00:48,051
lt's him.

1868
02:00:48,287 --> 02:00:49,652
You?
- You?

1869
02:00:49,822 --> 02:00:52,290
l guess you two know each other
from before.

1870
02:00:55,661 --> 02:00:57,458
They know each other too well.

1871
02:00:57,563 --> 02:00:58,427
ln and out.

1872
02:00:58,731 --> 02:01:01,564
Everything that he took
out...he would take in. Right?

1873
02:01:01,667 --> 02:01:03,464
ln and out.
What are you saying?

1874
02:01:03,603 --> 02:01:05,468
Sister, l'll tell you.

1875
02:01:05,605 --> 02:01:07,835
This guy's a down-market thief.

1876
02:01:08,007 --> 02:01:10,066
Bloody fool...colgate.. babul.

1877
02:01:10,209 --> 02:01:11,972
Thief.
Siddhu, you're a thief.

1878
02:01:12,211 --> 02:01:14,304
Well...your brother's a thief too.

1879
02:01:14,447 --> 02:01:16,415
And he's got a shop at the flea-market.
- Brother.

1880
02:01:16,582 --> 02:01:18,743
He used to buy all the goods l stole.

1881
02:01:19,352 --> 02:01:20,546
Forget your girlfriend's brother...

1882
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:21,880
Your brother's coming.
- Brother...

1883
02:01:22,155 --> 02:01:23,417
Stop him. He'll go berserk.

1884
02:01:23,623 --> 02:01:25,386
Brother...brother...

1885
02:01:25,491 --> 02:01:28,187
Shakti, please don't...

1886
02:01:28,594 --> 02:01:30,425
Did l starve him?

1887
02:01:30,696 --> 02:01:31,993
So what was the reason...

1888
02:01:32,231 --> 02:01:34,028
Brother, this girl...

1889
02:01:34,233 --> 02:01:36,201
This girl is the reason, brother.

1890
02:01:37,036 --> 02:01:39,197
Brother, in this era you can ask
any youth like me...

1891
02:01:39,305 --> 02:01:41,705
...and he'll tell
you that finding love...

1892
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:45,004
...has become so expensive and hard.

1893
02:01:45,244 --> 02:01:48,907
l mean...if we go watch a film
in the multiplex, that's 800 rupees.

1894
02:01:49,048 --> 02:01:51,380
And if you eat a combo
of popcorn and fritters...

1895
02:01:51,484 --> 02:01:52,576
...then it's 900 rupees.

1896
02:01:52,752 --> 02:01:55,619
And after that if your
baby says ''Baby, coffee''...

1897
02:01:55,755 --> 02:01:58,724
...then treating her to coffee
costs almost 1000 rupees.

1898
02:01:58,858 --> 02:02:00,223
And all night on your
prepaid card, we do...

1899
02:02:00,426 --> 02:02:04,385
''Hello...baby, sweety, love you...''

1900
02:02:04,497 --> 02:02:07,898
Then where the 2000 rupees go,
no one knows.

1901
02:02:08,267 --> 02:02:11,168
And...gift on her birthday.

1902
02:02:11,370 --> 02:02:12,701
Gift on Valentine's Day.

1903
02:02:12,905 --> 02:02:16,306
''And baby...we met for
the first time on Friday.''

1904
02:02:16,843 --> 02:02:20,677
Then every Friday...
there's a weekly anniversary gift.

1905
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:22,338
l mean like...really...

1906
02:02:22,548 --> 02:02:25,073
So many expenses?
- You don't know.

1907
02:02:25,218 --> 02:02:27,880
Brother...your era
was completely different.

1908
02:02:28,054 --> 02:02:29,316
Your date would mean
eating corncobs and having tea...

1909
02:02:29,422 --> 02:02:32,323
...and cozying up behind stones.

1910
02:02:32,558 --> 02:02:35,391
But the girls these days
are very high maintenance.

1911
02:02:35,528 --> 02:02:36,586
Ask us...

1912
02:02:36,762 --> 02:02:39,526
We've to pay weekly at multiplexes,
coffee shops...

1913
02:02:39,632 --> 02:02:41,862
...and malls to prove our love.

1914
02:02:42,034 --> 02:02:44,559
lt is not that easy.
lt's bloody extortion.

1915
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:45,568
Siddhu...

1916
02:02:45,671 --> 02:02:46,933
Relax, Siddhu...
or you'll blow a nerve.

1917
02:02:47,106 --> 02:02:48,596
Wait, l'll handle him now.

1918
02:02:48,741 --> 02:02:51,642
Siddhu .. we didn't know you were
going through so many troubles.

1919
02:02:51,811 --> 02:02:53,335
lt's so expensive.

1920
02:02:53,746 --> 02:02:56,544
Shakti, the poor boy's
stuck between love and expenses.

1921
02:02:57,049 --> 02:02:58,778
Puraskar bhai..
- Oscar bhai.

1922
02:02:58,918 --> 02:03:00,408
lt's the same thing.
You're an award after all.

1923
02:03:00,653 --> 02:03:03,247
Siddhu's a nice guy.
- Yeah.

1924
02:03:03,422 --> 02:03:05,515
For me, Siddhu is just like Veer.

1925
02:03:05,658 --> 02:03:07,091
Oscar bhai, he's my brother.

1926
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:09,888
We're a descent family.
No criminal records.

1927
02:03:10,062 --> 02:03:12,053
Forget that,
he loves your sister so much.

1928
02:03:12,198 --> 02:03:14,689
He's well to do.
The café, garage, property...

1929
02:03:14,867 --> 02:03:16,061
lt will all belong
to these two after us.

1930
02:03:16,202 --> 02:03:18,864
Please, say yes.
- But how can l say yes.

1931
02:03:19,038 --> 02:03:20,062
Why not?

1932
02:03:20,206 --> 02:03:20,695
Why not?

1933
02:03:20,873 --> 02:03:22,670
You two are already
a match made in heaven.

1934
02:03:22,808 --> 02:03:23,740
Us?

1935
02:03:23,876 --> 02:03:27,209
You two are sailing in the same boat.

1936
02:03:27,446 --> 02:03:29,471
Don't feel embarrassed.
Feel proud of him.

1937
02:03:29,615 --> 02:03:30,172
But...

1938
02:03:30,449 --> 02:03:33,350
Brother, please say yes.
- Come on, say yes.

1939
02:03:33,553 --> 02:03:37,011
Okay...l agree to this marriage...

1940
02:03:37,223 --> 02:03:38,554
Jackie Shroff lookalike.

1941
02:03:38,724 --> 02:03:40,385
But l have a condition.

1942
02:03:40,927 --> 02:03:42,792
ls someone going to ask what?
- What?

1943
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:44,897
The marriage takes
place in a church.

1944
02:03:45,031 --> 02:03:46,089
What are you saying?

1945
02:03:46,232 --> 02:03:48,325
Everyone agreed to Siddhu
and Jenny's marriage.

1946
02:03:48,601 --> 02:03:50,034
That's great news.

1947
02:03:50,236 --> 02:03:51,168
Their family said yes...

1948
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:53,067
...l wonder when will
our family say yes.

1949
02:03:53,239 --> 02:03:55,639
Don't worry,
Veer...they will say yes.

1950
02:03:55,908 --> 02:03:57,808
Tell Siddhu we want a party.

1951
02:03:58,110 --> 02:04:01,705
Let's all meet and celebrate.
What say?

1952
02:04:01,814 --> 02:04:03,111
Yeah, okay. Cool
- Bye.

1953
02:04:06,252 --> 02:04:09,744
l told you...not to keep
any kind of relation with them.

1954
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:12,350
Sis...

1955
02:04:14,727 --> 02:04:19,221
Sis...you've a problem
with that family. Not me.

1956
02:04:20,566 --> 02:04:24,468
And you're not telling
me what that problem is either.

1957
02:04:24,637 --> 02:04:28,004
l don't understand
why you're doing this, sis.

1958
02:04:32,044 --> 02:04:34,604
After mom and dad passed away...

1959
02:04:36,248 --> 02:04:40,082
...l've always fulfilled
all your wishes and wants

1960
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:44,184
And never asked why.

1961
02:04:45,224 --> 02:04:47,784
l even let you take
your own decisions.

1962
02:04:49,562 --> 02:04:51,530
And never asked why.

1963
02:04:52,298 --> 02:04:57,930
So today, for the first time, when
l am stopping you from something...

1964
02:04:59,238 --> 02:05:01,399
...can't you do this much for me?

1965
02:05:04,477 --> 02:05:08,709
Fine, sis...l'll do everything you say.

1966
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:11,716
l'll never ask anything, l promise.

1967
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:15,817
But if not Veer...

1968
02:05:16,522 --> 02:05:19,355
...then there won't be
anyone else in my life.

1969
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,547
lshita...

1970
02:05:43,949 --> 02:05:45,473
Call Veer home tomorrow.

1971
02:05:46,652 --> 02:05:49,212
l want to talk to him.
- You mean...

1972
02:05:49,422 --> 02:05:51,356
Ask him to come alone.

1973
02:05:53,726 --> 02:05:55,694
Thank you, Pogo... Ma'am.

1974
02:05:55,795 --> 02:05:57,092
Sorry...!

1975
02:05:57,463 --> 02:06:00,523
Brother will be really
happy to know that you said yes.

1976
02:06:01,834 --> 02:06:03,563
But now you must accept
one of my condition!

1977
02:06:03,769 --> 02:06:04,326
Done.

1978
02:06:04,437 --> 02:06:05,563
l mean...whatever it is, l agree.

1979
02:06:05,738 --> 02:06:08,366
You can say it for formality,
but done.

1980
02:06:08,774 --> 02:06:11,140
After the marriage,
you must live here.

1981
02:06:15,581 --> 02:06:19,540
lf you want to be with lshita...
you must leave your brother.

1982
02:06:22,722 --> 02:06:24,485
Sis...what are you saying?

1983
02:06:26,192 --> 02:06:28,160
Are you joking?

1984
02:06:35,801 --> 02:06:37,701
lshu...this is a big issue.

1985
02:06:38,738 --> 02:06:40,968
Meera's asking me
to leave my brother.

1986
02:06:41,207 --> 02:06:45,041
See, l really love you...
but he isn't just my brother.

1987
02:06:45,277 --> 02:06:48,075
He's my father,
mother, friend...everything.

1988
02:06:48,781 --> 02:06:51,477
All his life he has only
cared about my happiness.

1989
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:53,242
And she wants...

1990
02:06:58,591 --> 02:07:02,220
Sorry madam...you might
own a restaurant.

1991
02:07:02,361 --> 02:07:05,262
But this is not some
home-delivery or take-away.

1992
02:07:12,471 --> 02:07:13,938
lshita, l am sorry.

1993
02:07:17,376 --> 02:07:20,174
But nothing is more
important than a brother.

1994
02:07:22,381 --> 02:07:23,507
Not even you.

1995
02:07:31,857 --> 02:07:32,551
Veer!

1996
02:07:36,061 --> 02:07:38,291
You're leaving her
for that brother of yours.

1997
02:07:38,564 --> 02:07:40,657
He isn't even your blood brother.

1998
02:07:44,336 --> 02:07:47,305
Your dad picked him
up from the streets.

1999
02:07:47,873 --> 02:07:49,204
lshita...

2000
02:07:50,709 --> 02:07:53,473
You don't believe me.
Ask him yourself.

2001
02:07:53,579 --> 02:07:54,477
Enough!

2002
02:08:35,487 --> 02:08:36,545
Where were you Veer?

2003
02:08:36,689 --> 02:08:38,088
l've been asking around for you.

2004
02:08:38,224 --> 02:08:39,885
Come, let's eat...

2005
02:08:43,429 --> 02:08:44,589
What happened?

2006
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:51,199
l wanted to ask you something.
- Ask. Why are you standing like that?

2007
02:08:51,503 --> 02:08:54,370
ls there something you've ever hidden
from me?

2008
02:08:54,907 --> 02:08:56,875
What could l ever hide from you?

2009
02:08:57,042 --> 02:09:00,534
No! There's nothing
l have hidden from you.

2010
02:09:01,213 --> 02:09:03,306
You're not my blood brother.

2011
02:09:12,157 --> 02:09:15,126
Who told you that?
- lshita's sister.

2012
02:09:18,697 --> 02:09:20,187
Why are you quiet?

2013
02:09:20,466 --> 02:09:23,264
Just tell me, you have my swear

2014
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:30,167
lt's true that l am not
your blood brother.

2015
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:39,442
lt's a different thing that
l love you more than a blood brother.

2016
02:09:41,387 --> 02:09:45,949
And it's true that
l hid this fact from you.

2017
02:09:46,892 --> 02:09:51,454
lt's a different thing...
l didn't want to lose you.

2018
02:09:57,970 --> 02:10:00,837
lshita's sister has a
condition for our marriage.

2019
02:10:01,707 --> 02:10:03,174
That l should leave you.

2020
02:10:08,047 --> 02:10:13,508
So...what did you say?

2021
02:10:14,586 --> 02:10:15,848
Get lost...

2022
02:10:16,488 --> 02:10:18,217
l left lshita, brother.

2023
02:10:22,061 --> 02:10:24,188
Brother...l'll find someone else.

2024
02:10:24,296 --> 02:10:27,356
But first l'll make sure that
she doesn't have an elder sister.

2025
02:10:32,738 --> 02:10:36,196
Don't forget to check.

2026
02:10:37,676 --> 02:10:38,802
Who knows...
l might have an affair...

2027
02:10:38,978 --> 02:10:41,242
...with every beautiful
girl's elder sister.

2028
02:10:50,622 --> 02:10:52,590
You bluntly said no?

2029
02:10:57,763 --> 02:10:59,230
Do you really love me so much?

2030
02:11:03,569 --> 02:11:05,935
Don't just stand there,
come here.

2031
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:30,889
What did you want to do?

2032
02:11:31,296 --> 02:11:32,854
You wanted to separate two brothers.

2033
02:11:33,232 --> 02:11:34,699
Did it pain that much?

2034
02:11:35,067 --> 02:11:37,558
The very thought of separating
from your kin was painful.

2035
02:11:37,936 --> 02:11:41,929
Think about what l went
though...when you killed my dad.

2036
02:11:42,374 --> 02:11:43,568
Did you think about it..
- l didn't kill your dad.

2037
02:11:43,742 --> 02:11:45,539
You're lying.
- lt's true!

2038
02:11:45,978 --> 02:11:47,707
lt's true ! Look into my eyes.

2039
02:11:48,947 --> 02:11:52,576
l swear on my brother that
l didn't kill your father.

2040
02:11:52,985 --> 02:11:55,385
Look into my eyes Meera...
this is the truth.

2041
02:11:57,222 --> 02:11:59,281
We were the ones who were betrayed.

2042
02:11:59,558 --> 02:12:00,752
Us.

2043
02:12:01,627 --> 02:12:04,221
And if you still don't believe me,
then take this...

2044
02:12:04,463 --> 02:12:06,363
...and end this matter right now.

2045
02:12:06,732 --> 02:12:09,223
Shoot, Meera. Shoot.

2046
02:12:09,701 --> 02:12:11,896
l won't survive from
this close, Meera.

2047
02:12:12,071 --> 02:12:13,197
Shoot!

2048
02:12:15,474 --> 02:12:16,236
Shoot!

2049
02:12:43,769 --> 02:12:50,538
''Why do they hold back
the love in your heart?''

2050
02:12:52,377 --> 02:12:58,646
''Why do they hold back
the love in your heart?''

2051
02:12:59,918 --> 02:13:04,082
''Boundaries.''

2052
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:07,855
''Boundaries.''

2053
02:13:08,393 --> 02:13:12,489
''Boundaries.''

2054
02:13:12,898 --> 02:13:15,594
''Boundaries.''

2055
02:13:17,436 --> 02:13:24,604
''Why do they bring
a distance in love?''

2056
02:13:25,811 --> 02:13:33,115
''Why do they bring
a distance in love?''

2057
02:13:33,385 --> 02:13:37,981
''Boundaries.''

2058
02:13:38,357 --> 02:13:41,155
''Boundaries.''

2059
02:13:42,094 --> 02:13:45,996
''Boundaries.''

2060
02:13:46,498 --> 02:13:49,558
''Boundaries.''

2061
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:16,652
''Our dreams were delicate like glass.''

2062
02:14:17,162 --> 02:14:24,295
''They shattered as
soon as we touched them.''

2063
02:14:25,337 --> 02:14:33,472
''The one whose company
l prayed for...''

2064
02:14:33,845 --> 02:14:41,342
''...that companion separated.''

2065
02:14:41,787 --> 02:14:43,812
''Dying isn't right...''

2066
02:14:43,956 --> 02:14:49,622
''...but living isn't an option either.''

2067
02:14:50,162 --> 02:14:51,993
''Dying isn't right...''

2068
02:14:52,097 --> 02:14:57,364
''...but living isn't an option either.''

2069
02:14:57,803 --> 02:15:01,933
''Boundaries.''

2070
02:15:02,374 --> 02:15:05,366
''Boundaries.''

2071
02:15:06,111 --> 02:15:10,445
''Boundaries.''

2072
02:15:10,716 --> 02:15:14,208
''Boundaries.''

2073
02:15:41,213 --> 02:15:43,340
Malik sir was the
one who betrayed them.

2074
02:15:44,216 --> 02:15:46,684
Whatever Kaali said is true.

2075
02:15:48,754 --> 02:15:51,484
Raghav, why didn't
you tell me this before?

2076
02:15:51,690 --> 02:15:54,158
l couldn't
go against Malik sir.

2077
02:15:55,193 --> 02:15:58,162
And l didn't want
a daughter to find out...

2078
02:15:58,563 --> 02:16:00,030
...what her father has done.

2079
02:16:04,770 --> 02:16:07,034
You don't know what you've done.

2080
02:16:08,907 --> 02:16:10,807
You don't know what you've done.

2081
02:16:35,534 --> 02:16:37,729
You love your brother a lot,
don't you?

2082
02:16:40,539 --> 02:16:41,164
Yes!

2083
02:16:42,741 --> 02:16:44,436
And my lshita too.

2084
02:16:46,378 --> 02:16:49,677
Then marry her and stay here.

2085
02:16:50,482 --> 02:16:52,382
With your brother.

2086
02:16:57,289 --> 02:16:58,347
What?

2087
02:16:58,724 --> 02:17:01,488
You mean...l won't die a bachelor.

2088
02:17:01,693 --> 02:17:03,388
l'll get married too.

2089
02:17:03,495 --> 02:17:05,827
l'll go on a honeymoon too.
- Veer.

2090
02:17:07,065 --> 02:17:09,499
l mean...would you like some tea.

2091
02:17:09,601 --> 02:17:10,693
You must have tea.

2092
02:17:10,869 --> 02:17:13,337
l suggest that you have
breakfast instead, Pogo.

2093
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:15,337
lshita, come.
We'll go to the kitchen and make tea.

2094
02:17:15,474 --> 02:17:16,304
Come...

2095
02:17:16,508 --> 02:17:17,839
Brother, don't just stand there...

2096
02:17:18,043 --> 02:17:19,670
Pogo's come home for the first time.

2097
02:17:19,811 --> 02:17:22,405
Show her the garage,
the house, the sofa...

2098
02:17:22,514 --> 02:17:23,640
Come on, brother.

2099
02:17:43,935 --> 02:17:45,061
Nice house.

2100
02:17:46,405 --> 02:17:47,337
lt's new.

2101
02:17:50,075 --> 02:17:51,042
Thank you.

2102
02:17:58,984 --> 02:18:01,350
That's...our garage.

2103
02:18:02,187 --> 02:18:03,313
We modify car...

2104
02:18:03,422 --> 02:18:04,889
Designing... styling...

2105
02:18:05,424 --> 02:18:07,221
Fiber...the works...

2106
02:18:09,528 --> 02:18:11,689
You always loved cars.

2107
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,769
That's Anwar and Shakti.

2108
02:18:20,272 --> 02:18:21,000
Remember?

2109
02:18:21,273 --> 02:18:22,535
Now they run a café.

2110
02:18:22,808 --> 02:18:24,776
Still multi-talented l guess.

2111
02:18:36,354 --> 02:18:38,788
Raghav told me the truth.

2112
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:42,958
That's true.

2113
02:18:44,062 --> 02:18:48,556
You haven't changed at all.
- Except for a little beard.

2114
02:18:50,068 --> 02:18:51,831
Actually...you haven't changed either.

2115
02:18:52,771 --> 02:18:55,740
Maybe l've put on a little weight.
- Yes, a little...

2116
02:18:57,309 --> 02:18:59,277
l...l didn't mean that.

2117
02:18:59,478 --> 02:19:02,879
You...do look fine, same like before.

2118
02:19:03,081 --> 02:19:04,810
Really?
- No!

2119
02:19:06,685 --> 02:19:07,549
Only a little.

2120
02:19:09,888 --> 02:19:10,786
l am sorry.

2121
02:19:13,959 --> 02:19:15,449
lt's been 15 years Kaali.

2122
02:19:20,265 --> 02:19:20,890
15 years...

2123
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:22,826
4 months...

2124
02:19:23,502 --> 02:19:24,161
10 days!

2125
02:19:29,207 --> 02:19:30,970
The rest of the garage's ours too.

2126
02:19:31,076 --> 02:19:33,306
Engineering department...AutoCAD...

2127
02:19:33,512 --> 02:19:34,501
The whole...

2128
02:19:37,482 --> 02:19:38,972
l am so sorry!

2129
02:19:40,218 --> 02:19:41,549
l am so sorry!

2130
02:19:42,687 --> 02:19:45,815
l thought what l saw was the truth.

2131
02:19:46,591 --> 02:19:48,559
l didn't give you a chance to explain.

2132
02:19:49,661 --> 02:19:51,356
l didn't believe you.

2133
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:54,261
l wanted to tell you, Meera.

2134
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:57,561
But you were already gone. And...

2135
02:19:58,303 --> 02:19:59,201
l came here.

2136
02:20:00,071 --> 02:20:01,561
But you know what...

2137
02:20:02,407 --> 02:20:04,705
Let's forget all this now.

2138
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:08,976
We...we don't need to look back now.

2139
02:20:09,314 --> 02:20:11,339
But it was entirely my fault.

2140
02:20:11,616 --> 02:20:12,844
l can't...

2141
02:20:13,218 --> 02:20:16,949
lt wasn't your fault...nor mine.

2142
02:20:19,524 --> 02:20:20,957
The circumstances were to be blamed.

2143
02:20:27,232 --> 02:20:28,893
Meera, l...
- l ...

2144
02:20:37,909 --> 02:20:39,570
Good morning, Raj bhai.

2145
02:20:39,878 --> 02:20:42,108
Here comes the wedding
days...Kurkure and Lays (Wafers).

2146
02:20:42,247 --> 02:20:44,977
Come with me...
The wedding procession is coming.

2147
02:20:45,116 --> 02:20:46,913
Raj bhai, let's go.
- Where?

2148
02:20:47,118 --> 02:20:49,052
To make the wedding guest list.

2149
02:20:49,187 --> 02:20:51,781
lf l make one, only thieves
and criminals will come.

2150
02:20:51,957 --> 02:20:54,517
And they'll even steal the cutlery.

2151
02:20:55,126 --> 02:20:58,391
Raj bhai...who is she?

2152
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:59,927
Your wife?
- No..

2153
02:21:00,131 --> 02:21:01,894
No no, you're not married yet.

2154
02:21:02,067 --> 02:21:03,432
Your girlfriend.
- No...

2155
02:21:03,568 --> 02:21:05,058
No...you don't have a girlfriend either.

2156
02:21:06,404 --> 02:21:07,200
What?

2157
02:21:07,372 --> 02:21:10,205
After seeing the wedding procession. Are you
dreaming of Becoming a groom as well.

2158
02:21:10,342 --> 02:21:12,708
What are you saying? What are you doing?
- Speak up naughty fellow.

2159
02:21:12,844 --> 02:21:14,209
Come on, let's go and talk there.

2160
02:21:14,579 --> 02:21:16,638
Okay.
By the way, l am Oscar.

2161
02:21:17,115 --> 02:21:19,310
What do l call her?
Can l call her sister-in-law?

2162
02:21:19,751 --> 02:21:24,654
''Walk with me...in every lifetime.''

2163
02:21:25,090 --> 02:21:29,959
''Promise me...
you'll come back to me right here''

2164
02:21:30,328 --> 02:21:35,356
''We're one soul...
even if we're two bodies.''

2165
02:21:36,101 --> 02:21:40,970
''Always be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

2166
02:22:17,375 --> 02:22:18,307
Pogo, thank you.

2167
02:22:18,510 --> 02:22:20,068
Now even l can get
married because of you.

2168
02:22:20,211 --> 02:22:22,042
l did nothing.

2169
02:22:22,547 --> 02:22:24,447
When there's love...then
you should get married.

2170
02:22:24,549 --> 02:22:26,210
Then why didn't you get married yet.

2171
02:22:26,351 --> 02:22:29,149
There's a reason, l can't tell you.

2172
02:22:29,254 --> 02:22:30,721
But can l tell you something?

2173
02:22:30,889 --> 02:22:32,857
When l came here with
Siddhu to book this place...

2174
02:22:33,091 --> 02:22:34,581
...l got a wonderful news.

2175
02:22:34,726 --> 02:22:38,594
Even if you hold two weddings here,
the price of the hall is still same.

2176
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:42,962
And...the expenses for decorator
and caterer is also the same.

2177
02:22:43,268 --> 02:22:44,599
Very enticing.

2178
02:22:45,103 --> 02:22:46,570
But tell me one thing...

2179
02:22:47,005 --> 02:22:50,463
Does my face tell you l am a miser?

2180
02:22:50,742 --> 02:22:51,674
No.

2181
02:22:51,876 --> 02:22:53,503
That's not it.

2182
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:55,579
But there has to be some excuse...

2183
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:57,108
...to take things forward.

2184
02:23:12,430 --> 02:23:13,397
Look.

2185
02:23:14,299 --> 02:23:15,891
They look so happy.

2186
02:23:16,701 --> 02:23:18,134
Yes, they are.

2187
02:23:18,636 --> 02:23:21,400
Soon lshita and Veer
will get married too.

2188
02:23:21,973 --> 02:23:23,634
You will miss lshita a lot.

2189
02:23:23,775 --> 02:23:24,400
A lot.

2190
02:23:24,576 --> 02:23:27,101
Actually you can come
home everyday to meet lshita.

2191
02:23:27,412 --> 02:23:30,279
ln fact, l can even
pick you up from the shack.

2192
02:23:30,849 --> 02:23:32,680
You can have dinner with us.

2193
02:23:32,817 --> 02:23:35,115
Nowadays l even cook well.

2194
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:36,444
Really?
- Really.

2195
02:23:36,554 --> 02:23:40,820
So taxi, catering,
escort service...whatever.

2196
02:23:41,259 --> 02:23:42,123
Wow!

2197
02:23:45,430 --> 02:23:49,594
But...pickup and drop every day.

2198
02:23:51,903 --> 02:23:55,134
l must think of another
way to meet lshita every day.

2199
02:23:56,107 --> 02:23:58,473
Actually, l do have a way.

2200
02:23:59,377 --> 02:24:00,435
What?

2201
02:24:03,114 --> 02:24:05,878
Can you meet me for
five minutes tomorrow?

2202
02:24:06,818 --> 02:24:07,807
Huh?

2203
02:24:20,565 --> 02:24:22,032
l'll think about it.

2204
02:24:41,386 --> 02:24:43,183
This is my car.

2205
02:24:43,454 --> 02:24:44,580
Open the boot!

2206
02:24:47,992 --> 02:24:53,953
Joshua...who is the man here,
claiming this car to be his car?

2207
02:24:55,099 --> 02:24:56,066
You.

2208
02:24:57,902 --> 02:24:59,961
You only said it...

2209
02:25:00,305 --> 02:25:03,638
Go and bring that guy.

2210
02:25:03,808 --> 02:25:04,502
Yes, sir.

2211
02:25:04,742 --> 02:25:07,575
Whiter than white...
that's Oscar family.

2212
02:25:07,745 --> 02:25:10,145
Where are you taking me?
ls there less salt in the food.

2213
02:25:12,317 --> 02:25:13,614
Hail Mother Mary.

2214
02:25:14,986 --> 02:25:16,146
When asked,
He said that he owns the car.

2215
02:25:16,287 --> 02:25:17,117
Yeah...

2216
02:25:17,288 --> 02:25:19,518
When the dog's about the die...

2217
02:25:19,858 --> 02:25:23,658
...the Thakur's manager says,
''Thakur's dead''.

2218
02:25:23,795 --> 02:25:25,422
That's nothing orginal.

2219
02:25:25,597 --> 02:25:27,758
lt's a dialogue from
Karan-Arjun (Bollywood film).

2220
02:25:27,932 --> 02:25:30,765
Maybe you don't know who l am.

2221
02:25:31,069 --> 02:25:32,627
l am King. King.

2222
02:25:32,837 --> 02:25:36,273
So do you want me to make your
adhaar card, son of burger king.

2223
02:25:36,474 --> 02:25:37,372
This car...

2224
02:25:37,575 --> 02:25:42,069
Don't even dream about this car.

2225
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:44,375
l won't sell it at any cost.

2226
02:25:44,616 --> 02:25:48,950
And anyway, Oscar never
deals with the likes of you.

2227
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:50,587
Have your food and leave quietly.

2228
02:25:51,322 --> 02:25:54,621
Forgive me...it's not my fault.

2229
02:25:54,859 --> 02:25:57,760
Mani stole this car
and brought it to me.

2230
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:07,968
When the dog's about the die...

2231
02:26:08,206 --> 02:26:12,575
...the neighboring puppy
eyes his young widow.

2232
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:14,141
How nice, sir...

2233
02:26:14,412 --> 02:26:16,937
Neighboring puppy...
young widow

2234
02:26:17,181 --> 02:26:18,910
What a message.

2235
02:26:20,151 --> 02:26:21,209
Where's everyone?

2236
02:26:21,319 --> 02:26:23,287
Hello...one, two, three, four...

2237
02:26:23,688 --> 02:26:25,656
Widow... puppy...

2238
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:27,519
Everyone's right here, Mani.

2239
02:26:27,692 --> 02:26:31,093
Just that...my right and your
left indicator is switched on, son

2240
02:26:31,195 --> 02:26:36,098
Mani...there were drugs
worth millions in the boot!

2241
02:26:36,834 --> 02:26:41,396
Veer found those packets.
l don't know what he did with it.

2242
02:26:41,572 --> 02:26:43,938
Ask him and he'll tell you.

2243
02:26:44,175 --> 02:26:45,437
Hello.

2244
02:26:45,944 --> 02:26:47,741
Get Veer!

2245
02:26:49,213 --> 02:26:50,612
What's all this, King?

2246
02:26:50,848 --> 02:26:52,543
Why bring me here like this?

2247
02:26:53,117 --> 02:26:56,177
When the dog's about the die...

2248
02:26:58,957 --> 02:27:01,118
Joshua, l am out of stock.
Have you got anything?

2249
02:27:01,292 --> 02:27:03,123
l have with a cat.
- Shut up!

2250
02:27:03,861 --> 02:27:06,921
Mani bhai. Oscar bhai, why are you both
looking in the opposite directions?

2251
02:27:07,098 --> 02:27:08,156
Are you angry with each other?

2252
02:27:08,299 --> 02:27:10,130
No, they were being stiff with me.

2253
02:27:10,301 --> 02:27:12,269
So...l stiffened their neck.

2254
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:14,233
King, you're crossing your limits.

2255
02:27:14,372 --> 02:27:15,566
l am.

2256
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:18,235
Because back in college...

2257
02:27:19,043 --> 02:27:21,603
...Seema and Rekha didn't
let me cross my limits.

2258
02:27:22,013 --> 02:27:24,743
lt happens with everyone, King.
Don't get emotional.

2259
02:27:24,949 --> 02:27:27,918
What did you do with my drugs, Veer?

2260
02:27:28,586 --> 02:27:30,144
Whatever l did,
you were involved in it too?

2261
02:27:30,288 --> 02:27:30,913
Meaning?

2262
02:27:31,089 --> 02:27:35,082
Your drugs were burning
in the same bonfire...

2263
02:27:35,193 --> 02:27:37,821
...where you were keeping
your hands warm.

2264
02:27:38,096 --> 02:27:41,930
l kept asking you
''Was there something in the car''.

2265
02:27:42,166 --> 02:27:44,134
Hello, One, two, three, four...

2266
02:27:44,302 --> 02:27:48,102
Are you crazy?
You burned away drugs worth millions.

2267
02:28:01,652 --> 02:28:03,449
Veer. Veer.

2268
02:28:09,460 --> 02:28:10,484
Kaali!

2269
02:30:23,461 --> 02:30:25,326
We know the truth, sis.

2270
02:30:25,630 --> 02:30:27,291
Brother told us everything.

2271
02:30:27,498 --> 02:30:28,760
Don't worry.

2272
02:30:29,033 --> 02:30:31,297
Yeah...you were right
and brother was wrong.

2273
02:30:31,502 --> 02:30:32,992
You left him because...

2274
02:30:33,204 --> 02:30:36,605
...brother turned from washer man Ramlal
into Kaali for money.

2275
02:30:37,441 --> 02:30:40,205
And you didn't want his
bad influence on my upbringing.

2276
02:30:40,344 --> 02:30:41,311
So you...

2277
02:30:41,445 --> 02:30:43,811
Pogo, please rest. Would
you like some juice? l'll go get it.

2278
02:30:43,981 --> 02:30:45,278
Have an apple too.
Come lshu come.

2279
02:30:45,683 --> 02:30:47,275
Brother..
- Yeah...got it.

2280
02:30:50,655 --> 02:30:52,623
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

2281
02:30:53,524 --> 02:30:55,287
Because we shouldn't
tell them in the first place.

2282
02:30:55,393 --> 02:30:56,655
What's the point, Meera?

2283
02:30:56,794 --> 02:30:58,421
The enmity between our dads...

2284
02:30:58,529 --> 02:31:01,293
Killing each other... Why?

2285
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:05,301
Actually,
we should all start afresh.

2286
02:31:05,636 --> 02:31:08,605
And no one needs to look back.

2287
02:31:10,841 --> 02:31:13,969
But why did you prove yourself wrong,
and me right?

2288
02:31:19,083 --> 02:31:20,482
You see...

2289
02:31:21,953 --> 02:31:25,912
ln big countries...
these small things often happen...

2290
02:31:26,490 --> 02:31:27,923
Senorita.

2291
02:32:03,661 --> 02:32:06,653
''lt's the night to celebrate.''

2292
02:32:07,164 --> 02:32:10,156
''lt's the night to celebrate.''

2293
02:32:10,434 --> 02:32:13,528
''Sway to the beat,
O my tormentor.''

2294
02:32:21,012 --> 02:32:24,345
''Your mischief lights up the place.''

2295
02:32:24,448 --> 02:32:27,576
''You went crazy, and l got attitude.''

2296
02:32:27,718 --> 02:32:31,017
''Let the world be jealous.''

2297
02:32:31,289 --> 02:32:34,315
''Let the world be jealous.''

2298
02:32:34,692 --> 02:32:37,786
''And the beloved dances
all night with her sweetheart.''

2299
02:32:52,276 --> 02:32:55,575
''Life is like a saga.''

2300
02:32:55,746 --> 02:32:58,977
''The style of big-hearted people.''

2301
02:32:59,216 --> 02:33:05,121
''When l grab the opportunity.''

2302
02:33:05,890 --> 02:33:09,223
''The way to live freely.''

2303
02:33:09,493 --> 02:33:12,724
''Learn this method from us.''

2304
02:33:12,863 --> 02:33:18,802
''We have all the fun in a moment.''

2305
02:33:20,104 --> 02:33:23,073
''Come and have fun with us.''

2306
02:33:23,607 --> 02:33:26,940
''Come and have fun with us.''

2307
02:33:27,044 --> 02:33:30,343
''Or just stay away
and watch us have fun.''
