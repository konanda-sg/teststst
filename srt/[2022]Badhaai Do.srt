1
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,833
How many more cups of tea
before you wake up?

2
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,791
Do you come to my parents'
only to drink tea?

3
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,458
Just take a laxative!

4
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,291
Mummy, can I skip school today?

5
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,375
No! You are not skipping school anymore!

6
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,416
So, it's decided, right?

7
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:28,875
Yes, sure.

8
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,916
Mom, if you've already decided,
then why have this family meeting?

9
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,333
We dropped all our
morning chores to be here!

10
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,000
When it came to our marriages,
there was no such discussion!

11
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,250
But of course…

12
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,833
he's the son of the house!

13
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,125
When it comes to his marriage,
caste, religion, nothing matters!

14
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,916
Auntie, they're even ready to
let him marry a Muslim girl!

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,416
I wasn't even allowed to choose
a boy from our own caste.

16
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,166
You had an affair before our marriage?

17
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,666
It was just an example!

18
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,333
You really have zero imagination!

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,916
-Look…
-Yes.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,416
it's not like we readily agreed, right?

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,416
He's been adamant since four years

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,250
that he won't marry anyone except her.

23
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,708
So, what should we do?

24
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,875
Let him remain a bachelor forever?

25
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,125
And can't you see
how noble your brother is?

26
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,250
He's upheld our family honor
for the last four years.

27
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,500
Absolutely, Mom!

28
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,666
He's been living alone
in Dehradun all this while.

29
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,291
He could've easily eloped if he wanted.

30
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,208
But, did he?

31
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,166
Baby…

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,875
what do you think?

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,333
What will Auntie say?

34
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,625
It's been a year
and she still can't decide

35
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,750
whether she wants her cataract
operated or not.

36
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,208
Enough, now!

37
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,916
Auntie Baby, please speak up.

38
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,791
What can I say?

39
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,625
If his father were around,
he'd have counseled him.

40
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,416
He passed away eight years ago.

41
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,958
Is it still his responsibility?

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,291
Baby, say something.

43
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,125
He is your only son!

44
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,916
You seem to have lost two biscuits.

45
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,791
Really?

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,458
Really?

47
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,625
A naughty bunny
nibbled them away last night!

48
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,708
Come on, sir!

49
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,333
Any more photos?

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,583
Can't see any more.
She's not on my friend list.

51
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,833
You think they're a good match?

52
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,250
I mean, our brother's so fit
and she's kinda plump, no?

53
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,500
So what? Nothing like some
meat to grab onto!

54
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,791
I meant…

55
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,791
I was just trying to say that…

56
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,000
She should be healthy, right?

57
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,458
You tell us.
What do you think?

58
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,625
I think…

59
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,916
That we should meet Naaznin's family.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,083
-No!
-Yes.

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,541
-And fix a date!

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,041
Yes.

63
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,041
He says we should
fix a wedding date!

64
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,541
Very well, then.

65
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,875
You'll gorge on sweets soon.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,625
WOMEN POLICE STATION

67
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,750
Sir's here.

68
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,833
-<i>Jai hind</i>, sir!
-<i>Jai hind</i>!

69
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,333
<i>Jai hind</i>, sir!

70
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,791
WOMEN HELPLINE

71
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,083
Hello, Women Police Station.

72
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,958
Madam, Sections 354, 368, 498A…

73
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,500
I'm bored dealing
with domestic squabbles.

74
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,708
If I had Section 302, 307…
that would be exciting.

75
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,916
What's your problem?
Why do you want a transfer?

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,166
Other men would kill to get posted
at a Women's Police Station.

77
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,875
Let me open that for you.

78
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,208
And there's you, playing saint
in a garden of temptation!

79
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,250
People only come here
to rant about their in-laws,

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,458
or swap knitting
patterns and recipes.

81
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,291
And now there's a nursery
right behind my cabin.

82
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,791
Those yelling kids make my ears bleed.

83
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,083
I'm not enjoying it here, ma'am.

84
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,333
Are you here for enjoyment or work?

85
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,708
Tell me!

86
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,250
Have you seen the FIR
your team has typed?

87
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,541
Do you know how much the state
spends on Computer Training?

88
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,583
Go, get it redone!

89
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,750
Give that back.

90
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,458
It's stuck.

91
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,500
I'll get it opened.

92
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,791
Go.

93
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,458
OFFICE INCHARGE

94
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,416
That's the mouse, keep it down.

95
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,625
Naaznin.

96
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,041
Yes, sir?

97
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,791
What's this?

98
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,500
It's the report, sir.

99
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,041
You call this a report?

100
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,166
There are six fonts on one page.

101
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,833
Spacing, alignment…
it's all a mess.

102
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,958
Come on, put your heart into it.

103
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,458
But it's an FIR, sir…
Not a love letter.

104
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,750
-You think that's funny?
-Sorry, sir.

105
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,083
Hey, kiddos!

106
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,875
SUB INSPECTOR'S ROOM

107
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,375
Watch your tongue.

108
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:08,916
I'm your senior officer.

109
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,666
Redo this.

110
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,458
-Hold on a second.
-Okay, sir.

111
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,750
Hello, Auntie.

112
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,708
Hello, Shardul.

113
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,083
So, we had a discussion at home,

114
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,625
about you marrying Naaznin.

115
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,458
One moment.

116
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,041
Open this and give it to ma'am.

117
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,083
Okay.

118
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,041
Yes, Auntie.

119
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,625
Well, everyone's agreed!

120
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,458
What's the matter?
Aren't you happy?

121
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,041
How can I be happy, Auntie?

122
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:54,083
You all took so long to say yes,
she said yes to someone else.

123
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,041
Oh, God!

124
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,750
He's saying Naaznin got married.

125
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,916
Hello, Shardul.

126
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,375
What happened?
Did she really get married?

127
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,666
Yes Mom, do you want to
see her marriage certificate?

128
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,958
He hung up!

129
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,208
What now, Mom?

130
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,125
Why are you all so sad?

131
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,166
This is great news!

132
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,833
Let's find him a girl
from our own caste now!

133
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,666
Yes.

134
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,500
AMIRAH
IT SUITS YOU WELL

135
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,333
What are you doing?

136
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,333
Papa, the under-18
team selection is on.

137
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,416
The coach asked us
to shave our arms and legs.

138
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,958
Selectors are strict these days.

139
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,125
Check this out!

140
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,833
Everyone thinks I'm
your older brother.

141
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,125
We pointlessly got you
a fake underage certificate.

142
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,250
What is it?

143
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,625
Sumi?

144
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,791
"Tell her…"
What do I tell her?

145
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,000
"Shave?"

146
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,666
Why would Sumi shave Naman's arms?

147
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,250
Text me. I'm running late.

148
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,916
Mom's vow of silence
includes texting as well!

149
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,333
Did she leave again?

150
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,208
Good going! Concentrate!

151
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,916
Well done, Kavita, Simran!

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,500
Vishakha, pass it to Vaishnavi!

153
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,458
Vaishnavi, shoot!

154
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,208
Come on Vaishnavi, concentrate!

155
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,125
Pass the ball.

156
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,708
Everyone, assemble here.

157
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,000
Get started.

158
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,125
Rotate!

159
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,666
Clockwise.

160
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,250
Anti-clockwise.

161
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,916
That dating app you told me to join.

162
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,500
A guy wants to meet up.

163
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,666
Go ahead!

164
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,583
Or do you want to chat endlessly?

165
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,083
Right!

166
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,833
Just don't get physical
on the first date.

167
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,833
Left!

168
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,750
Switch!

169
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,833
-Sir.
-I'll break your legs!

170
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,583
Wait till your Dad discovers your antics!

171
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,875
Think you can outrun me?

172
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,416
-Get in line!
-Sir.

173
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,708
Another Runaway Romeo, sir!

174
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,208
He left that girl and ran!

175
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,500
Sir.

176
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,208
Cops appear and love disappears?

177
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,500
-Sorry, sir.
-You think he'll be loyal?

178
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,416
One more?

179
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,458
Hey, stop!

180
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,458
Catch them!

181
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,000
Sir!

182
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,750
-What?
-"Laasbian", sir!

183
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,291
Lesbians? Get them out!

184
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,041
Come out, quick!

185
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,875
Come out now!
Why so shy?

186
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,250
Sir, please!

187
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,666
They're homos!

188
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,875
Sir!

189
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,375
We caught two homos.

190
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,250
Come on! Get in line!

191
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,791
Hey! Get lost, you two. Scoot!

192
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,708
Such people are
ruining this country.

193
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,500
But, sir…

194
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,958
Shall I call your mother?

195
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,666
Do it properly.

196
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,041
-What's up?
-Go on, have a look!

197
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,583
-Sorry, sir.
-Here you go.

198
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,291
-Think you're in a park?
-Sorry, sir!

199
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,708
Left!

200
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,541
Left, right, left! Left!

201
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,250
-Ms. Suman!
-Left, right, left! Left!

202
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,708
Someone's here for you.

203
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,250
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning, ma'am.

204
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,416
Sumi's a very senior teacher here.

205
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,750
Didn't you say she's very fair?

206
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,916
She looked very different in the photo.

207
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,958
She's much darker in person.

208
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
Not at all!

209
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,750
-Sumi, unzip your jacket.
-What?

210
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,708
Don't be shy, it's just us!

211
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,625
See!

212
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,500
What are you doing?

213
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,000
See how fair she is!

214
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,125
Come with me!

215
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,125
She's just got a bit tanned
being on the field everyday.

216
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,083
She won't be working
after marriage anyway.

217
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,375
Why would I quit my job?

218
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,375
Then who'll take care
of the house?

219
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,583
Whose house is it?

220
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,500
As of now, it's a rented place.

221
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,000
But my Sanju has bought
a big plot of land in Daalanwala!

222
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,458
-Really! In Daalanwala?
-Yes.

223
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,000
Can I see his picture?

224
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,083
I meant Sanju's picture,
not your husband's!

225
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,166
This is Sanju!

226
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,125
Oh!

227
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,833
By the way,
auntie probably didn't tell you…

228
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,958
I was engaged once before.

229
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,833
But just before the wedding,
the boy passed away.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,791
Sanju's your only child, right?

231
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,750
Are you willing to take such a big risk?

232
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,583
Hey, Kusum!

233
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,875
Tell your mother
to never call me again!

234
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,625
Kusum! Listen to me!

235
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,541
What did you say to Auntie Priya?

236
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,708
Did you see the guy's picture?
He was an uncle!

237
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,041
You're 31 already.

238
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,458
Are you expecting young boys?

239
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,583
You'd be lucky to even get an "uncle."

240
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,041
New excuses every time!

241
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,333
What excuses?

242
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,666
I did like a boy once, right?

243
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,458
Agreed to marry him as well.
Remember what happened?

244
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,500
He's been dead for six years!

245
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,333
Even his parents
would've moved on by now.

246
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,791
But you still won't let go!

247
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:24,041
Am I destined to remain
a wedding guest forever?

248
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,041
What future do you have?

249
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,083
Couldn't you become
a Math or Science teacher?

250
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,875
Became a sports teacher instead!

251
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,666
You can't even take up private tuition!

252
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,041
So, now you're concerned
about my future?

253
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,708
Why didn't you let me pursue handball?

254
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,375
I was selected for the nationals!

255
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,500
I could've landed a job
in the railways.

256
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:44,000
You went out of your way to get
this loser a fake certificate.

257
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,375
Was he selected?
What did he achieve?

258
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,291
Want a loudspeaker?

259
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,166
Go on, tell the entire neighborhood!

260
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,166
Don't you act cheeky with me.

261
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,583
Didn't you tell him?
I paid for your fake certificate!

262
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,375
Whiny little Mama's boy!

263
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,333
-Mom!
-Tell me something.

264
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,541
Why can't you play with boys your age?

265
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,041
Because he's a duffer!

266
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,208
My colleague Urvashi,
she stays near the school.

267
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm moving in with her.

268
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,708
We'll split the rent.

269
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,291
Papa, are you listening to me?

270
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,375
-Prem?
-I'm leaving!

271
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,625
-Always after me--
-Hi!

272
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,666
Those documents I gave you…

273
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,625
Here.

274
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,375
All done?

275
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,041
How much?

276
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,166
Bye!

277
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,041
Saw that?

278
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,458
She's younger than you.

279
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,000
See how she flirts with me!

280
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,458
Papa, I'm serious!

281
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,541
I'm leaving home.

282
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,541
I can't take your wife's
daily taunts anymore.

283
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,166
What will people say?

284
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,083
Couldn't get our girl married,
so we washed our hands off her?

285
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,916
Why do you take
mom's words to heart?

286
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,458
Learn from your father.
Turn a deaf ear to her.

287
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,708
And we can live in peace.

288
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,875
Peace will arrive in our house
only once she departs.

289
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,166
That's going to be one helluva long wait!

290
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,000
You should also move with me!

291
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,291
Why be stuck with that old hag?

292
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,833
Maybe you'll find someone
to flirt with as well.

293
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,541
Yeah, right!

294
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,208
What is it?

295
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,625
-It's Sumu.
-Hello!

296
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,041
Hello, Nonu!

297
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,166
Ask, "How are you?"

298
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,125
How are you?

299
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,458
I'm great! How about you?

300
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,833
I'm fine as well.

301
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,625
-Bye.
-What?

302
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,250
Damn, she ran away!

303
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,250
She misses you a lot.

304
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,166
-Keeps asking, "Where's Sumu?"
-Why have you called?

305
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,250
I'm coming home next week.

306
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,083
Let's meet?

307
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,333
Don't avoid me this time.

308
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,333
Just focus on your family, okay?

309
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,250
CAN WE MEET?

310
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,333
-Hello.
-Sorry, but I'm waiting for someone.

311
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,250
Suman Singh?

312
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,416
Raju.

313
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,083
Surprised?

314
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,916
Suman!
Hold on for a moment, please!

315
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,625
Suman! Hear me out.

316
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,458
Just listen for a bit?

317
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,000
You don't like boys at all?

318
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,583
Try me out once!

319
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,666
Get away from me!

320
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,208
And don't try to
contact me ever again!

321
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,000
Have some roti.

322
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,875
-Hello?
-<i>Hello, Suman. Raju.</i>

323
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,208
I've got your number
with great difficulty.

324
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:22,791
Yes?

325
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,250
Photocopy this, please.

326
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,000
Chapter 16.1 to 16.3.

327
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,208
Go away or I'll report you.

328
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,250
Oh, really?

329
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,291
Go ahead.

330
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,875
I'll expose you as well.

331
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,166
Buddy!

332
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,416
Make it two copies.

333
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,875
Look…

334
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,416
I'm requesting you.

335
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,250
Please stop bothering me.

336
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,791
I'm also requesting you.

337
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,166
I'm not asking
you to be my girlfriend.

338
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:08,958
Just do it once.

339
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,375
20 rupees.

340
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,375
20?

341
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,958
Bye, ma'am!

342
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,958
Who was that?

343
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,833
Ex-student.

344
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,000
-Name?
-Suman.

345
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,625
Ti--

346
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,083
Hello, Mom. What is it?

347
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,208
No, I've not seen the photos.
I'm on duty.

348
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,625
My heartbreak's still fresh.
I'm not done grieving yet.

349
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,583
At least let my wounds heal!

350
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll call you later.
I'm busy.

351
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,458
Yes, later. Bye.

352
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,250
-Title?
-Singh.

353
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,583
-Punjabi?
-No, I'm a Thakur from UP.

354
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,166
Gender?

355
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,041
Take a guess?

356
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,833
Female… of course.

357
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,666
This boy harassing you,
what's his name?

358
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,500
Rajeev Paadi-set…

359
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,208
Paddisetti, sir.
Rajeev Paddisetti.

360
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,541
Squat!

361
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,708
Now that you look like a cock,

362
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,208
you better lay some eggs
for our dinner.

363
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,250
But hens lay eggs, not cocks.

364
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,791
Sorry, sir.

365
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,875
Being cheeky with a cop, engineer?

366
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,708
Should I wrench out your nuts?

367
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:40,916
Come on, show me your hand.

368
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,375
-Hand in front, now!
-Sir, please, not my hands.

369
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,416
Sir, please.

370
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,666
-Do it now!
-Sir, please!

371
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,541
Sir, please, not the right hand.
I have an exam tomorrow.

372
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,083
Ma'am!

373
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,333
-Namaste, sir.
-Namaste.

374
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,166
-Did you find him?
-Of course!

375
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,833
He won't bother you again.

376
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,208
I told him off.

377
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,833
-Just told him off?
-Yes.

378
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,333
Why didn't you beat him
naked on an ice-slab?

379
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,750
You could've broken his limbs at least!

380
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,458
I…

381
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,291
"Told him off…"

382
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,750
I mean…

383
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,333
Don't worry.

384
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,041
He won't harass any lady again.

385
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,250
Sorry! "Lady" suits older women…

386
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,125
You are…

387
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,583
you're young. A girl.

388
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,250
Fresh as a daisy!

389
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,208
Sir, I--

390
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,125
What do you teach?
Social Sciences?

391
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,875
No. Physical Education.

392
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,500
Oh, P.T!

393
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,916
I'll get going.

394
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,250
Yeah, sure.

395
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,041
I'm never assigned any senior classes.

396
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,083
She doesn't tell me a word.

397
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,625
I'll be back.

398
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:17,958
Hello!

399
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,833
What are you up to?

400
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,916
Are you stalking me?

401
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,416
Women go to the police
for their safety.

402
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,250
Where do we go if
policemen start stalking us?

403
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,291
Hey…

404
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,208
It's not what you think.

405
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,250
-This isn't a police matter.
-Then, what is it?

406
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,875
Can I speak to you
for two minutes? Alone?

407
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:38,791
Why?

408
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,416
It's kind of a private matter.

409
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,250
First of all, thanks for
coming here with me.

410
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,208
Couldn't you find a better place?

411
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,666
There won't be any disturbance here.

412
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,666
Like I said, it's a personal matter.

413
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:58,833
Go on.

414
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,166
Sure.

415
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,875
So, as you mentioned in the report,

416
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,083
you're from the Thakur caste,
female, age 31.

417
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,625
There must be pressure
from your family to get married?

418
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,333
I'm 32, the same caste.

419
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,916
What are you suggesting?

420
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,625
That we get married?

421
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,750
Damn, I was so nervous!

422
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,958
You just spoke my mind!

423
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,500
This is great!

424
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:25,958
Look, brother…

425
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,833
I was engaged once

426
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,041
and the groom died two
weeks before the wedding.

427
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,208
How?

428
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,416
In an accident!

429
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,625
Was he driving? Where?

430
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,750
Which police station?

431
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,916
Is this an interrogation?

432
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,833
Don't you get it?

433
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,166
I'm cursed. Deadly cursed!

434
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,500
Hey, one second!

435
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:47,875
Hold on.

436
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,541
Please sit.
Two minutes, please.

437
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,166
Look, I…

438
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,458
Sorry. Protein shake.

439
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,958
Look, I'm pretty broad-minded.

440
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't believe in curses!

441
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,541
And honestly, I feel we are…

442
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,583
a match made in heaven.

443
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,666
Don't you get it?

444
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,416
I have no interest in marriage.

445
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,791
-I don't want to get married!
-I know!

446
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,416
What do you know?

447
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,291
Raju told me…

448
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,916
that you have zero interest in men.

449
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,916
I get it.

450
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,041
That's fine by me!

451
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,166
Look…

452
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,875
just like you're
not interested in men… right?

453
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,291
But…

454
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,416
What?

455
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,000
You know…

456
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,666
I…

457
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,166
You know what I mean…

458
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,250
-What?
-I'm… I'm just like you.

459
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,125
I'm homosexual.

460
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,500
-What are you?
-Homosexual!

461
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:51,458
Who's there?

462
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,041
Sirohi!

463
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:54,875
Sirohi!

464
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,083
-<i>Jai hind</i>, sir!
-Wha… what did you hear, Sirohi?

465
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,125
Nothing, sir.

466
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,791
But don't worry,
your secret's safe with me!

467
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,500
What… what secret, Sirohi?

468
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,375
That you and ma'am…

469
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:12,625
here…

470
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,125
Yeah, we were just…

471
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,375
-Now scoot, come on!
-Carry on, sir!

472
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,708
Get going!

473
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,375
Actually…

474
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,500
You think he heard me?

475
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,125
-So…
-Water?

476
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,625
Yes, water…

477
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,041
No, it's okay. Thanks.

478
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,291
-So, what was I saying?
-That you're gay.

479
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,500
Yes, I am…

480
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,041
So, I was saying that if we get married…

481
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,750
our families will get off our backs.

482
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:03,416
Right?
And then we can live in peace.

483
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,833
Live freely, together…

484
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,750
Like roommates?

485
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,208
How can I be sure you're gay?

486
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:19,416
The state doesn't give certificates
to prove it, right?

487
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,666
I am what I am. Right?

488
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,833
Anyway, why would someone
just say they're… gay?

489
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,083
Doesn't make sense, right?

490
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:34,916
What do you say?

491
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,791
Plus, you'll be under my protection!

492
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,583
-Ma'am, a bit to the left.
-Yes.

493
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,916
A little more.

494
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,416
Raise your legs. Outward!

495
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,958
And smile!

496
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:56,125
What a pretty pair of swans!

497
00:26:56,916 --> 00:27:00,375
Sarita, Vinita, Nishita, Udita,
and myself Rekha.

498
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,250
Dad finally gave up his dream
of having a son after me.

499
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,291
I'm Dr. Anup Parihar.
Doctor of Homeopathy.

500
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,916
-My brother-in-law.
-Namaste.

501
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,500
<i>Let's raise a toast!</i>

502
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:15,166
<i>Let's raise a toast!</i>

503
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,916
<i>Let's raise a toast!</i>

504
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,125
<i>Oh, no!</i>

505
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,000
<i>Oh, no!</i>

506
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,250
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no! No!</i>

507
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:32,833
<i>Where did our prince</i>
<i>Find this pretty little bride?</i>

508
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,458
<i>Where did our prince</i>
<i>Find this pretty little bride?</i>

509
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:41,333
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

510
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:47,583
<i>The moon and lovebird</i>
<i>Entwined by a thread of fate</i>

511
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:55,000
<i>Families have joined the party</i>
<i>Uncles let loose and gyrate</i>

512
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:59,583
<i>The couple have blissfully wed</i>
<i>Look how the bride blushes red</i>

513
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:04,625
<i>This moonfaced lass would pick our boy</i>
<i>Could anyone have guessed?</i>

514
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,708
<i>Oh, no! No!</i>

515
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:10,666
<i>Where did our prince</i>
<i>Find this pretty little bride?</i>

516
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,333
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

517
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:18,041
<i>Where did our prince</i>
<i>Find this pretty little bride?</i>

518
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:22,000
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

519
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,166
Shanti, you're here.

520
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,416
Sir, please have a seat!

521
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,583
Please come.

522
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,125
Naaznin didn't come?

523
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:44,541
<i>A heaven-made union</i>
<i>Never to be undone</i>

524
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:51,750
<i>No one quite knows</i>
<i>Where the plots lead here-from</i>

525
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,833
<i>A couple of parched souls in heat</i>

526
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,666
<i>Here comes the proverbial twist</i>

527
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,208
<i>Quickly gather cotton</i>
<i>Assemble a fluffy quilt</i>

528
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,791
<i>Oh, no! No!</i>

529
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,750
<i>Where did our prince</i>
<i>Find this pretty little bride?</i>

530
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,375
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

531
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:17,166
<i>Where did our prince</i>
<i>Find this pretty little bride?</i>

532
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,250
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

533
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:24,333
Sir, now that the kids are married…

534
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:28,083
if you could get them
a flat at the police colony.

535
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,291
<i>Dance and raise a toast!</i>

536
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:43,000
<i>Dance and raise a toast!</i>

537
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,666
<i>Dance and raise a toast!</i>

538
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,000
<i>Dance and raise a toast!</i>

539
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:53,041
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

540
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,000
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

541
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,500
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

542
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,375
<i>Raise a toast!</i>

543
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:42,666
26…

544
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,125
Hi. Are you ready?

545
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,416
Yeah.

546
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,583
Shall we head out?

547
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:59,416
No, actually Kabir's coming,
so… I'll be with him.

548
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,250
Oh…

549
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,916
so you're on a real honeymoon!

550
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,291
Good for you.

551
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,541
How much?

552
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,625
-Hi.
-Yeah?

553
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:46,041
Your family wants a selfie,
shall we take one?

554
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,666
Selfie? Yeah, sure.

555
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,833
This hotel's pretty fancy.

556
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,125
Must be expensive, right?

557
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,541
It's Kabir's choice, after all.

558
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,916
Where's Kabir?

559
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,291
Kabir…

560
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,875
I've been calling and
texting him since morning.

561
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,083
No response.

562
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,750
No idea where he is, or what he's up to.

563
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:29,208
You know, I've never spoken
about Kabir to anyone till date…

564
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,250
except you.

565
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,541
Thank you!

566
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,541
-The selfie?
-Come--

567
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,041
Yeah, of course!

568
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,666
Let me put this glass away…

569
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,625
or they'll think I've been drinking.

570
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,250
A bit closer.

571
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,166
Sorry.

572
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,083
You know what?
Let's do this tomorrow.

573
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,125
Sure, tomorrow it is!
No big deal.

574
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,083
Where are you going?

575
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,208
Sit for a while!

576
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:07,416
No, I'll carry on.

577
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,083
I'm a cop!

578
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:11,666
Don't be nervous!

579
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,125
Come! Come, sit.

580
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:29,125
So did you always
want to join the police?

581
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,375
Police?

582
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,166
Are you kidding?

583
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,250
I just…

584
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,125
I wanted to be this.

585
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,375
One second, wait.

586
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,000
What are you doing, Shardul?

587
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,333
-Please! It's okay.
-Wait a minute.

588
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:55,958
Look here.

589
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,916
See?

590
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,750
See those pecs.

591
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,666
Yeah!

592
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,041
Look, triceps.

593
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,875
These were double the size
a decade ago!

594
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,291
Look at this.

595
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:23,708
Touch it?

596
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,083
Hard as a rock!

597
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:26,583
Back.

598
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,458
Can you see it?

599
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:34,166
Abs… see these abs?

600
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,416
This…

601
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,916
See?

602
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,250
This…

603
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,291
See what I wanted to be…

604
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,250
"Mr. India"!

605
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,791
How can I see?

606
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,333
Mr. India's invisible, right?

607
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,208
-You're making fun of me…
-No.

608
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:57,750
Fine, go ahead.

609
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,333
Make jokes.

610
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:04,541
Destiny already played
the biggest joke on me.

611
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,208
Although…

612
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,916
I trained my ass off for three years.

613
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,125
Sweat it out at the
gym for six hours, daily!

614
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,416
Never took steroids or anything.

615
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,541
You know <i>Pumping Iron</i>?

616
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:19,833
I watched it 35 times!

617
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,208
I flicked the VCD from a store.
Watched it every day!

618
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,666
What?
Did you say something?

619
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:30,833
-No.
-Okay.

620
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,833
And then the year I was
to enter the competition…

621
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,416
my father kicked the bucket!

622
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,166
He was martyred, right?

623
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,375
Yeah, he was martyred.

624
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:50,458
My dream of becoming Mr. India

625
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:53,875
was also martyred with him.

626
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:00,125
The government offered me this job.

627
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,708
People in our country don't
even let go of a bus seat.

628
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,708
Would you?
Of course, you wouldn't!

629
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,625
How could I let go
of a government job?

630
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:16,375
Imagine, a gay man in the police!

631
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,625
I fear the police
more than criminals do.

632
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:25,125
What if someone finds out?

633
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,166
Have you watched <i>Robocop</i>?

634
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
<i>Robocop</i>?

635
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:31,916
<i>Robo…</i>

636
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,125
Well, I'm…

637
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,541
<i>Homocop!</i>

638
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,791
That's right, I'm <i>Homocop</i>!

639
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,791
Who am I? <i>Homocop</i>!

640
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,000
And if…

641
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,083
-Shardul?
-It's okay. I'm okay.

642
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,041
Did I not eat last night?

643
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,291
Right there.

644
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,041
Hi.

645
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,875
Kabir. He arrived this morning.

646
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,375
Suman.

647
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:23,083
I'll grab some breakfast, and then
we can all honeymoon together?

648
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,291
Tiger!

649
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,041
I'll be back.

650
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:31,875
Hey!

651
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,083
Is he a schoolboy?

652
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,833
He looks so young!

653
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,208
Of course not!

654
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,291
He's doing his MBA.

655
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:04,000
<i>Even alone in my room</i>
<i>It's your presence I feel</i>

656
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:13,416
<i>Upon the cradle of my thoughts</i>
<i>I carry you with me</i>

657
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:22,083
<i>When you put your palm on mine</i>

658
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:28,541
<i>Our lifelines shall intertwine</i>

659
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,166
<i>Now all that separates us</i>

660
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:39,500
<i>Is a distance of few steps</i>

661
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:44,583
<i>Seeking assent</i>

662
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:50,375
<i>Seeking assent</i>

663
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:57,875
<i>Seeking assent</i>

664
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:04,291
<i>Assent, yours and mine</i>

665
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:11,416
<i>Amid tiny window panes</i>
<i>In the verandah of my heart</i>

666
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:17,625
<i>Peeking mischief a pair of eyes truant</i>

667
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:23,916
<i>Scribbling a request</i>
<i>With crooked alphabets</i>

668
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:30,166
<i>A song of love</i>
<i>Whispering sweet nothings</i>

669
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:35,250
<i>A silken thread away</i>

670
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:40,916
<i>This breathy distance</i>

671
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,791
<i>Seeking assent</i>

672
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:52,416
<i>Seeking assent</i>

673
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:58,916
<i>Seeking assent</i>

674
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:05,708
<i>Assent, yours and mine</i>

675
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,291
You've been together for three years.

676
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,458
Doesn't he have any problem
with this marriage?

677
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,000
No. Why would he?

678
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,375
How did you two meet?

679
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,791
Blow into this.

680
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:34,666
Blow into this.

681
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,041
Carry on.

682
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:42,958
This isn't working. Hold this.

683
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,583
Stop the car. Stop!

684
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,250
Are you drunk?

685
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:56,750
No, sir.

686
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,083
Really?

687
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,583
In my hand.

688
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,458
Now.

689
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,583
Do it!

690
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,791
But sir, you told me to…

691
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,583
I asked you to blow, not spit!

692
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,208
-Get some water! Come out!
-Sorry, sir. Really sorry!

693
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,583
-Get out!
-I'm very sorry, sir.

694
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,666
He spat!

695
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,666
Bye!

696
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,125
At least say bye properly.

697
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,625
I did, of course! Let's go.

698
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,333
-How much?
-1,000 rupees.

699
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:53,625
Got 500 bucks?

700
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I don't.

701
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,125
All expenses will be split equally.

702
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,916
We're roommates, after all…
not an actual couple.

703
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,500
That's your room…

704
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,583
and this is mine.

705
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,833
Aren't we a little
too cut off from the city?

706
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,291
It's better this way.
No one knows us here.

707
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,916
There's zero risk.

708
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,333
Let's move to Siberia then!

709
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,333
There's no one there.

710
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,708
I've been waiting since
7:00 p.m., Shardul!

711
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,125
Why are you making
a big deal out of it?

712
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,500
I'm sorry I got late.

713
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,916
Let's move on, please!

714
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:39,583
Why are you ruining the mood?

715
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,208
Come on…

716
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,791
Why does it always have to be me?

717
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,458
Shardul, you know I have a problem.

718
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,166
Why do you say
we're versatile then!

719
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,208
Versatile, my foot!

720
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,333
This isn't fair.

721
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,166
I also feel like…

722
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,916
Look, if it's such a problem,
then let it be!

723
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,708
-I'll leave.
-Kabir!

724
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,208
Get up.

725
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,666
Prem, your entire machinery
is rusting from inside.

726
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,666
You only look young on the outside.

727
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,791
Hello…

728
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,000
I've come to the doctor with Papa.

729
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,666
No, I won't come today.

730
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,333
Ask Shardul to come home.

731
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,125
Okay, bye.

732
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:26,958
I've prescribed some tests.

733
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,125
Let's find out
where the problem lies.

734
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:31,250
Naman!

735
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,250
Naman?

736
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:34,625
Naman?

737
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,583
Where did he disappear?

738
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,250
What?

739
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,625
Now, I…

740
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,791
Listen.
The clinic's on your way, right?

741
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,291
What's this?

742
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,750
The doctor asked for a stool test.

743
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,791
What the hell, Papa!
At least pack it discreetly!

744
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,041
What's wrong?

745
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,458
-It's an airtight container!
-Please!

746
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,750
Millennium Pathology.

747
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,833
Yes sir, we have all the tests.

748
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:08,416
Yes, sir.

749
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,708
I need a urine test.

750
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:19,416
You can put your sample in this
and go to that cabin over there.

751
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,333
Okay.

752
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,708
Sample?

753
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,166
Here.

754
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,666
This much!

755
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:35,583
-Sorry.
-No. One second.

756
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,625
This much is enough for a sample.

757
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:41,750
If you could…

758
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:43,750
-Okay.
-Yeah.

759
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,458
Must be half a kilo of shit!

760
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,541
I've kept the sample.

761
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:05,125
What about the rest?

762
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,000
I flushed it down.

763
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,083
Okay.

764
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:18,291
Rimjhim, when shall I come
to collect the test results?

765
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:19,500
You needn't come.

766
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:20,750
Why?

767
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,208
You'll get the reports online.

768
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:44,250
<i>While on the straight and narrow</i>

769
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:50,791
<i>Our eyes committed an offense</i>

770
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:56,958
<i>At night they break the law</i>

771
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:03,500
<i>By day they feign defense</i>

772
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:09,291
<i>While on the straight and narrow</i>

773
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:16,750
<i>Our eyes committed an offense</i>

774
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:23,833
Again?

775
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,541
This isn't mine!

776
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:26,750
This is for Pinky.

777
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,625
Okay.

778
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,708
Pinky!

779
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:36,375
Didn't you get the reports?

780
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,041
I did.

781
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:39,125
Then?

782
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:42,666
I wanted to get a test.

783
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,208
Which one?

784
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:50,875
There are many different kinds of tests.

785
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:54,500
Blood sugar, blood culture,
sugar, hypoglycemia.

786
00:46:56,083 --> 00:47:01,666
Eye test, hearing test, urine test,
CT scan, MRI, PT scan, ECG, EEG, X-ray.

787
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:05,958
Or AIDS?

788
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:09,125
Why would I get tested for AIDS?

789
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:10,875
No.

790
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,375
I'll get this one, for 299 rupees.

791
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:38,666
<i>You flowed into my life</i>

792
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,416
<i>Like a cool evening breeze</i>

793
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:45,041
<i>You're a knock that bruised me</i>

794
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:48,208
<i>And the balm that soothes me</i>

795
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:51,083
<i>You flowed into my life</i>

796
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,958
<i>Like a cool evening breeze</i>

797
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,625
<i>You're a knock that bruised me</i>

798
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,250
<i>And the balm that soothes me</i>

799
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,791
Feeling scared?

800
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,833
You can hold my hand.

801
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:10,875
<i>Your beauty's boundless</i>

802
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:18,416
<i>And I'm obsessed</i>

803
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:24,875
<i>The eyes, once restless</i>

804
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:31,458
<i>Focus on you, relentless</i>

805
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:37,333
<i>While on the straight and narrow</i>

806
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,958
<i>Our eyes committed</i>

807
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,375
Sure you want to give blood?

808
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,583
<i>An offense</i>

809
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:46,083
We could have coffee instead.

810
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:54,000
So, fully legal?

811
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:57,958
There were about 500 guests
at the wedding.

812
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:02,916
You live like a normal couple?

813
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,250
More like flatmates.

814
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,208
We even have separate rooms.

815
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,250
We're not even friends, really.

816
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:15,208
And your families?

817
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:16,958
They have no idea?

818
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,750
Look I wanted to be
completely honest with you

819
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,791
so, we don't have problems later.

820
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:30,125
That's cool.

821
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,958
My parents don't even speak to me.

822
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,958
I thought my sister
would understand…

823
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,916
but she won't even let me
near my niece now.

824
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,416
Why did you tell them?

825
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:54,000
I thought they're family,
they'd understand.

826
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,375
But, no.

827
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,000
No one understands, man.

828
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:09,041
Because we're different,

829
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,416
they think we're perverts.

830
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,750
And why must we
explain ourselves, anyway?

831
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:19,875
This is just a part of us.

832
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:21,375
It doesn't define who we are.

833
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:41,250
Get away from the railing!
Move back!

834
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,583
No, we won't come down!

835
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,375
Hey, get away from the railing!
Move back!

836
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,083
Move back from the railing!

837
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,000
Sirohi, don't scold them.

838
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:51,708
Cajole them.

839
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:52,791
Yes, sir.

840
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,458
Look kids…

841
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,416
life is a God-given gift.

842
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,291
Don't throw it away in a fit of passion!

843
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:01,625
And suicide is a crime.
You know that, right?

844
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,541
We've called your parents.

845
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:05,541
-They've agreed to your demands.
-<i>Jai hind</i>, sir.

846
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,666
Are these lovebirds
building a nest up there?

847
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,083
Get them down!

848
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,375
Call them if you don't believe us.

849
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:14,500
Shardul, call for sweets.
Your work is done!

850
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,250
Get ready to shift.

851
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,625
Thank you, sir!
Thank you, ma'am!

852
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,666
Why, ma'am?

853
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,625
Thank your aunt!

854
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,208
She's the one who requested me.

855
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,500
My aunt?

856
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:30,500
She asked me to get a flat allotted
for you in the police colony.

857
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,166
You can shift on Monday.

858
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,833
Don't mess up your lives.

859
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,875
All eyes are on you!

860
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:38,833
All eyes are on you!

861
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:44,458
Great! At least we're in the city now.

862
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,000
Good morning, sir.

863
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:05,916
Start unpacking.

864
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:07,625
-Shardul.
-Yeah?

865
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,666
-What the hell?
-What?

866
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,541
I got the smaller room in Goa,
the last house, and here as well?

867
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:15,375
Yeah! The house is allotted to me,
as part of my allowance.

868
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,375
Fine.

869
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,708
My rent contribution
will be smaller as well.

870
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,458
Hey!

871
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:24,375
Where are the car keys?

872
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,083
In my pocket.

873
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:29,208
What happened?

874
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:31,541
It's a gift from my father,
not your dowry!

875
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:36,708
-Hello!
-Hello!

876
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,041
-Why don't you drop by sometime?
-Yes, of course.

877
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,666
But first, you must
come over with sir!

878
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:47,583
We can't hire housemaid here.
It's risky!

879
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,791
Fine. All chores will be split equally.

880
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:58,625
Nice!

881
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,416
<i>Traffic control, please take note.</i>

882
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,000
I sent my maid to your place.
You didn't hire her?

883
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,541
-Yes, actually--
-We don't need one!

884
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,166
She does all the work!

885
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:09,291
School gets over by afternoon anyway.

886
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:11,083
She gets bored at home.

887
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,125
-<i>We're getting repeated calls</i>
-Sir.

888
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,291
<i>from number 420.</i>

889
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:16,250
-Ma'am, please sit.
-Please come.

890
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,791
<i>Alpha three, come in.</i>

891
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,333
Go make us some tea!

892
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:28,166
Ma'am, we got this flat.
Thanks to sir.

893
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,083
Now if you put in a word,

894
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,875
I could get a transfer from
the Women's Station.

895
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,166
It's been three years.

896
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,458
No kickbacks, no income.
It's parched out there, sir!

897
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,166
Now that you're living above me,

898
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,416
you think you can
dance on my head?

899
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,250
Sir…

900
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:59,791
<i>Cheetah one to Tango three.</i>

901
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,500
<i>Tango three to Cheetah one, copy.</i>

902
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,083
<i>Street dogs have wreaked havoc</i>
<i>in the neighborhood.</i>

903
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:15,000
<i>Swing your batons at them.</i>
<i>That'll scare the dogs away.</i>

904
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:22,541
-I'll be back in a second.
-Okay.

905
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,458
Why aren't you making tea?

906
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:28,291
It's your turn today. You make it!

907
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:30,375
Keep it low, I have a
reputation to maintain!

908
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,958
If you hold your reputation
so dear, watch your tongue!

909
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,791
Got it?
I'm not your servant.

910
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,666
Acting cocky in front of your boss!

911
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,583
Of course not!

912
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:39,791
It's just to make us look
convincing as man and wife!

913
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:42,583
Really? Should I chase
you with a broom then?

914
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,166
You'll do all the chores today.

915
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,958
Wash the dishes and the bathroom.

916
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,583
For the entire week.

917
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,958
Okay?

918
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:54,916
Say, "you will."

919
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,083
Say it!

920
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:01,333
I will.

921
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,458
Please have some.

922
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:07,208
Sumi makes amazing fritters.

923
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:09,416
Ketchup?

924
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,958
<i>Dogs are roaming in a pack,</i>
<i>five or six of them.</i>

925
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,916
<i>Please reassure the public</i>
<i>that the police is at their service.</i>

926
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,916
Hello?

927
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:21,125
<i>The public and the dogs,</i>
<i>they're both a nuisance.</i>

928
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,958
The green chutney? Get it.

929
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:29,291
<i>Scare both the public and dogs with</i>
<i>batons if needed, to maintain order.</i>

930
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,125
You've really given him free rein!

931
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,041
Take charge, or he'll lord over you!

932
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,500
Very impressive!

933
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,333
Best to grab the reins early,

934
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:42,166
then they stay under control!

935
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,791
<i>Control room, please note--</i>

936
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:17,708
Occupied!

937
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,041
<i>The next destination</i>

938
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,625
<i>You alone know</i>

939
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:54,166
<i>Every hidden treasure</i>

940
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:57,625
<i>You alone know</i>

941
00:56:57,708 --> 00:57:00,625
<i>To find daylight in darkness</i>

942
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,458
<i>You alone know</i>

943
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:07,000
<i>How we pacified the heart</i>

944
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,958
<i>You alone know</i>

945
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:14,375
<i>We are contented</i>

946
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:19,375
<i>You are stupendous</i>

947
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:22,791
<i>You are stupendous</i>

948
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:31,708
<i>Bringing calm to the mind</i>

949
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:38,416
<i>You are that soothing thought</i>

950
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,583
<i>I was an obedient one</i>

951
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,916
Want to come home?

952
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,250
<i>But…</i>

953
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:50,791
<i>But my eyes have captivated you</i>

954
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,500
<i>Yes, they have</i>

955
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:12,333
Hi.

956
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,000
Rimjhim.

957
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,750
Title?

958
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:17,916
What?

959
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:20,833
Title?

960
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,625
Miss?

961
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:31,291
-Surname.
-Jongkey.

962
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:38,416
Who's that?

963
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,875
Who's she?
Ms. Bathroom?

964
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,125
She's a friend.

965
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:46,750
Really?

966
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Here, at home?

967
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,250
Does she know about us?

968
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:53,583
You told her?

969
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,750
So, Kabir knows about us as well!

970
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,166
But I've never brought Kabir here!

971
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,500
So, get him!

972
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,791
Have I stopped you?

973
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:02,916
Are you crazy?

974
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:05,208
This is a police colony.
I'm a cop!

975
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,041
What if someone finds out?

976
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:09,875
What's the big secret?

977
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:12,458
Is there some "good news"?

978
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:15,208
No, of course not!
We're still kids ourselves!

979
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,666
I got you temple offerings from Shirdi.

980
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:18,875
Cousin just got back.

981
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:20,583
-Sir's cousin?
-My cousin.

982
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:21,583
Your cousin!

983
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:29,916
Who's she?

984
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,041
-She's--
-Cousin.

985
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:35,541
Whose cousin?

986
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:36,583
Your cousin.

987
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:39,750
Yours got back from Shirdi, right?

988
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:41,125
This one's Sumi's cousin.

989
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:43,541
Her real cousin!

990
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,583
Timtim… Jhilmil.

991
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,666
-Rimjhim.
-Rimjhim.

992
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,875
So, she's Sumi's sister?

993
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:56,916
Yes.

994
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:57,958
Namaste.

995
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:58,958
Good morning.

996
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:01,333
She's convent-educated,
so, she speaks in English!

997
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,916
What's this?
Is she going to stay here?

998
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,500
She's my cousin, right?
So, she can stay with me.

999
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,583
Those bags there,
put them up in the loft.

1000
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,250
-One second. What?
-Bye.

1001
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,750
Hey, please keep that over there.

1002
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:38,750
-This?
-Yeah.

1003
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,208
Passport!

1004
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:48,500
It's blank! You didn't go anywhere?

1005
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:50,333
Then, why'd you get one made?

1006
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:54,125
I told you about Komal, right?

1007
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:56,708
Komal.

1008
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:59,791
A few months after marriage,

1009
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,791
she came back pregnant.

1010
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:05,833
Her parents live two streets away.

1011
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,541
Obviously, we started meeting again.

1012
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,625
She made me do all the
chores during her pregnancy.

1013
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,041
Nonu was born to her,

1014
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,958
but she felt like my own child.

1015
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,166
She was so tiny when she was born!

1016
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:27,416
Such tiny little hands and feet.

1017
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,541
When she got her first shot,
I cried louder than her.

1018
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:36,000
That baby-smell of hers, Rimjhim…

1019
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:37,666
wow!

1020
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,916
I would hold her
in my arms for hours.

1021
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,000
Only I could put her to sleep.

1022
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:47,958
Then Komal's husband came

1023
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:51,875
and took them both back to Delhi.

1024
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,875
I didn't feel as bad
about Komal's marriage…

1025
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:14,541
as I did about being
separated from that child.

1026
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,833
I wanted a child…

1027
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,375
so, I agreed to get married.

1028
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:45,875
Whenever that guy touched me…

1029
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:50,291
I felt so repulsed…

1030
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,375
and sick.

1031
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:58,416
I even contemplated suicide.

1032
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,291
Look at the irony.

1033
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,083
Two weeks before marriage, he died.

1034
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,125
Poor guy.

1035
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:21,000
That's when I realized…

1036
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:25,125
that if I want a child…

1037
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,916
I'd have to move abroad.

1038
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:33,208
So, I got a passport made.

1039
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,416
I tried my best.

1040
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,291
Filled many applications…
but nothing happened.

1041
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,541
I don't have any suitable qualifications.

1042
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,875
Well, you shouldn't have
any problem now.

1043
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:55,875
You have a husband.

1044
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,041
You can go for IVF.

1045
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,083
I want to adopt.

1046
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:10,291
A child will get a home,
and my dream will be fulfilled as well.

1047
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,083
I have a passport.

1048
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,375
So do you.

1049
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:19,833
Let's go abroad…

1050
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,541
and have a child!

1051
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:35,166
If she stays here, expenses
will be split three-ways.

1052
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:42,375
A kid with him?

1053
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:45,458
She'll have to do the dishes as well.

1054
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:59,000
<i>Dude, mommy had warned</i>
<i>No romantic shenanigans</i>

1055
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:02,750
<i>Get into an arranged and simple alliance</i>

1056
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,541
<i>Like the neighbor's kid who eloped and ran</i>

1057
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:09,833
<i>Told you not to follow after that dunce</i>

1058
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:14,000
<i>Dude, mommy had warned</i>
<i>No romantic shenanigans</i>

1059
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:17,916
<i>Get into an arranged and simple alliance</i>

1060
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:21,541
<i>By God, rightly, destiny would have it not</i>

1061
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,958
<i>The heart beats wild</i>
<i>Says love you lots</i>

1062
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,208
Should we add her name as well?

1063
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:28,541
<i>My head flew in a tizzy</i>
<i>So hard this heart was shot</i>

1064
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,000
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1065
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,708
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1066
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,208
<i>So hard this heart was shot</i>

1067
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:37,500
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1068
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:39,833
Hi!

1069
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,333
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1070
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:45,125
-Hello, how are you?
-That's fine.

1071
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,375
I'll get Sumi.

1072
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,166
We've come to meet you as well.

1073
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,041
Namaste.

1074
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:57,833
Mom, how come you're here suddenly?

1075
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,125
Who's this?

1076
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,833
-She's--
-She's Sumi's cousin.

1077
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:01,833
What?

1078
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,666
What?

1079
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:06,416
Come on!
How can she be Sumi's cousin?

1080
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:09,250
She's my cousin!
Real cousin!

1081
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,708
<i>That which is to happen will happen</i>

1082
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:20,083
<i>Why shed tears, worry without cause</i>

1083
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:23,166
<i>What we have today</i>
<i>We may not tomorrow</i>

1084
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,916
<i>Embrace this joy, it's now or never</i>

1085
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,458
Such a gay thing!

1086
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:29,083
<i>Go with the flow!</i>

1087
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:32,458
-Hello.
-Kabir, can't hear you!

1088
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:33,541
Hello?

1089
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,083
<i>Let me in your heart now</i>

1090
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:39,541
<i>By God, rightly, destiny would have it not</i>

1091
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:43,333
<i>The heart beats wild, says love you lots</i>

1092
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,083
<i>This crazy head spins like a top</i>

1093
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,791
When are you giving
us some "good news"?

1094
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,208
Everyone's waiting here!

1095
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:49,875
Did you book your tickets?

1096
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:51,500
-It's Sumi's first Diwali with us!
-Yes.

1097
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,125
<i>This crazy head spins like a top</i>

1098
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,458
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1099
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,750
Have some.

1100
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,291
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1101
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,708
<i>This crazy head spins like a top</i>

1102
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:03,083
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1103
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:12,333
<i>This pairing of yours and mine</i>

1104
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:16,000
<i>This love story, crazy, yea crazy bro</i>

1105
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,791
<i>Freedom newfound, unfurling</i>

1106
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:23,875
<i>Every shackle is shattering</i>

1107
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,875
<i>I'm so confused, yeah</i>

1108
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,791
<i>Everything's new, yeah</i>

1109
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,875
<i>What shall I do, yeah</i>

1110
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,750
<i>O God, show me the way</i>

1111
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:35,791
<i>By God, rightly, destiny would have it not</i>

1112
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:39,666
<i>The heart beats wild, says love you lots</i>

1113
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,750
<i>This crazy head spins like a top</i>

1114
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,208
<i>So hard it was got</i>

1115
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:44,541
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1116
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:48,208
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1117
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,833
<i>This crazy head spins like a top</i>

1118
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,208
<i>Lassie's hot!</i>

1119
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:57,250
How do you do all this?

1120
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:58,875
What?

1121
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,708
Whatever you were doing out there.

1122
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,208
All that cringy PDA,

1123
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,291
eating from the same plate.

1124
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:07,708
-How do you do it?
-It's just an act, Rimjhim.

1125
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,083
People must be convinced
that we're a real couple.

1126
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,750
So, why don't you just
have sex in public?

1127
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,625
Their doubt will be cleared forever!

1128
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,375
Why are you shouting?

1129
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,333
This is a police colony.

1130
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:19,791
And what do you expect me to do?

1131
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,291
Sit in your lap and shout,

1132
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:24,208
"Rimjhim is my real partner,
not Shardul!"

1133
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,250
Don't even try.

1134
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,583
You don't have the courage.

1135
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:28,166
Whatever drama you're playing,

1136
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,958
I don't wanna be
a part of this anymore!

1137
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:31,875
One day I'm your cousin,
the next day I'm his.

1138
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:32,958
I can't do this anymore!

1139
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:36,708
It's thanks to this "drama"
that we can stay together!

1140
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,916
For the first time in my life, I'm
living in my own house on my terms.

1141
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,416
It's a huge deal for me!

1142
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:46,541
And for this, I will lie if I have to!

1143
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:53,041
Thank God you are
just a sports teacher…

1144
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:55,625
or you'd definitely turn
all the kids into liars.

1145
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,375
At least I'm a sports teacher.
What are you?

1146
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,208
You just collect
people's poop and piss!

1147
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:10,791
Is she leaving?

1148
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:11,833
Why will she leave?

1149
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:13,333
Don't couples argue?

1150
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,208
But aren't we the couple here?

1151
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,791
Three bedrooms, two parking slots.

1152
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,166
There's no stamp duty either.

1153
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:04,625
And the best part is that it's on
the way to your college in Mussoorie.

1154
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,083
It's a great deal.

1155
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:11,916
Once I get that house…

1156
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:14,791
CALL ME, MAN!

1157
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:17,208
You could move there as a paying guest.

1158
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,875
Kabir?

1159
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,333
Kabir, are you listening?

1160
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:27,666
What did I just say?

1161
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:33,583
Two bedrooms, fab deal,
something like that.

1162
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,166
Two bedrooms?

1163
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,166
Hello?

1164
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:39,041
Hey, bro.

1165
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:42,125
What!

1166
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:43,666
No, shit!

1167
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,208
What are you saying!

1168
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,500
Now?

1169
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,583
Cool, I'm coming.

1170
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:53,875
Thanks, bro.

1171
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,500
I got to leave, man.

1172
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,333
They revised the deadline,
submission's tomorrow now.

1173
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:01,166
Sorry, man.

1174
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:09,041
Where's your phone?

1175
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,166
-Why?
-Show me your phone.

1176
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:12,583
-I won't!
-Show me your phone.

1177
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:15,250
-Why should I?
-I want to see it.

1178
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,500
-Why?
-Show me your phone.

1179
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,541
-I can't--
-Show me the phone!

1180
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,541
Show me your phone!

1181
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,208
What are you doing, Shardul? Let go!

1182
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:26,708
Do you take me for an idiot?

1183
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,958
Are you fooling around with me?

1184
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,791
I'd been planning this for a month.

1185
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,708
Especially took leave from office
to be with you, and you're…

1186
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,625
-Let go, Shardul, you're hurting me.
-Tell me, who is it?

1187
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:41,541
-Leave me!
-Show me your phone.

1188
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:43,541
-What are you--
-Show me the damn phone!

1189
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:47,250
Sorry. Sorry.

1190
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:49,833
Kabir. Kabir, sorry.

1191
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,583
Kabir, I…
I did it by mistake.

1192
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:54,791
I didn't mean to hit you, Kabir.

1193
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,541
Kabir! Kabir, sorry!

1194
01:11:56,750 --> 01:12:00,250
Kabir, sorry.
You can hit me back, Kabir!

1195
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:01,833
Kabir…

1196
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:45,125
You know, this entire obsession
with bodybuilding and gymming…

1197
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:48,208
I got it from Dheeraj.

1198
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,291
He was my first boyfriend.

1199
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,500
My gym trainer.

1200
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,291
He was ten years older than me.

1201
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,291
Married, with kids.

1202
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,250
Two of them.

1203
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:10,083
He even took me on holiday
with his family once.

1204
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:19,333
But we looked at life very differently.

1205
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:24,125
After a point, I started resenting him.

1206
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:25,791
I got bored.

1207
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:30,750
Then I started avoiding him.

1208
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:35,875
I'd keep ignoring his calls.

1209
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:40,416
He called so many times, man!

1210
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:44,625
Tried so hard to meet me….

1211
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,333
I even changed my gym.

1212
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,750
And you know what's funny?

1213
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,375
Now I'm the Dheeraj…

1214
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,708
in Kabir's life.

1215
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,375
But it's okay.

1216
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:21,250
It really is. I deserve this.

1217
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,458
I totally deserve it.

1218
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:03,125
Bye, Sister!

1219
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,750
HALDWANI

1220
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,875
Greetings.

1221
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,083
Is everyone here?

1222
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:30,333
Yes! It's her first Diwali
here, we'll all celebrate together.

1223
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:32,916
-Look, they're here!
-They are here.

1224
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,458
-Greetings.
-How are you?

1225
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,666
-May God bless you with a son!
-Greetings.

1226
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:39,000
-Greetings, Uncle.
-Greetings.

1227
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:40,958
Bless you.

1228
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:43,458
May you have many sons!

1229
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,083
Go, show them their room!

1230
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,541
Why the special treatment?

1231
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:50,708
I'll sleep in the room
with all the other men.

1232
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:52,083
Don't act all innocent now.

1233
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:54,000
Like we don't know what you're up to!

1234
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,125
You really have no idea what he's up to!

1235
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:57,750
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

1236
01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,291
Why don't you have water?

1237
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,625
Come on!

1238
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:04,625
For a boy, for a girl.

1239
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:08,083
She's been prepared for 12 years now.

1240
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,791
Now you need to do your bit.

1241
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,500
So? It's almost been a year!

1242
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:13,958
You've had your fun.

1243
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:17,041
This lovey-dovey romance
doesn't last long.

1244
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,708
You don't know our brother.

1245
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:21,500
He's been a ladies' man
since his school days!

1246
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,250
Oh, come on, you…

1247
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:26,833
Let me tell you one thing.

1248
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:30,541
A child is the glue that
keeps a marriage intact.

1249
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,625
One must have one's own kid.

1250
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:38,208
Children are the greatest investment.

1251
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:41,458
After a certain age,
who do you depend on?

1252
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:44,541
On them?

1253
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:48,083
It's only your child
who will look after you.

1254
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:53,333
Where are you going?

1255
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:54,833
To watch TV.

1256
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:56,291
Look!

1257
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:58,750
Wants to sleep during study-hours.

1258
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:00,708
And when it's bed-time,
he wants to watch TV!

1259
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:02,666
Kids are a headache!

1260
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:04,083
You have no life left,

1261
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,708
apart from running after them.

1262
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,083
You're confusing me now.

1263
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:10,125
Should one have kids or not?

1264
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,333
Anshu!

1265
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,458
Anshu! Where's this brat!

1266
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:17,666
I'll remove the batteries
from the remote!

1267
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Anshu!

1268
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:31,708
Your family's putting so much
pressure to have a baby.

1269
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,625
Why don't we adopt a child?

1270
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:36,916
Adopt? Are you nuts?

1271
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:38,416
What do you mean?

1272
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,166
Have you lost it? My family
doesn't believe in all this.

1273
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,125
It's your folks who've lost it.

1274
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,916
Going on and on
about having a baby.

1275
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:46,500
Is there nothing else to talk about?

1276
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:49,250
Well, they complain that
you backchat too much.

1277
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:52,000
What do you expect me to do?
Be a mute doll?

1278
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:53,791
It's just a matter of few days.

1279
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:55,625
Play the dutiful daughter-in-law.

1280
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:57,291
-Why are--
-Stop the rickshaw.

1281
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:59,166
-Stop the rickshaw, now!
-What happened?

1282
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,291
What happened?

1283
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:04,625
Hey!

1284
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:06,250
Where are you going?
What happened?

1285
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:09,041
I thought gay men are more
sensitive than straight men.

1286
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,750
But you're a total MCP!

1287
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:13,083
MC-- What?

1288
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,708
I said "MCP"!

1289
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,958
Men who consider women
to be inferior beings!

1290
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,416
Oh, that!
That's cool.

1291
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:24,250
What does being gay have
to do with it? All men believe that!

1292
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,833
Nonsense!

1293
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:26,750
Hold on.

1294
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,250
Being gay doesn't mean
one forgets one's values!

1295
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:34,416
Really? If you have
such strong values,

1296
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:38,416
why don't you go tell
your family the truth?

1297
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:43,375
Tell them that the light of their
clan is a torch with no flame.

1298
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:49,000
And that you cannot light
the hearth of their home!

1299
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,666
-You're crossing a line now.
-Am I, really?

1300
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:51,750
-Shardul!
-Really?

1301
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,958
-You're here!
-Hey!

1302
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:54,000
-Shardul--
-Greetings.

1303
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:56,125
-Hello. God bless you.
-God bless you.

1304
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:58,333
-Namaste.
-That's Mr. Sharma and Mrs. Sharma.

1305
01:18:58,416 --> 01:18:59,500
They live two houses away.

1306
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,458
This is Suman.

1307
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:04,083
Stay blessed, my dear.
She's so pretty!

1308
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:05,708
You're very lucky, son.

1309
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,375
Hey, mister!

1310
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:14,041
How long will you take? Come on!

1311
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,333
I'll be there in two minutes.

1312
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,916
<i>Both defending champions</i>
<i>are baying for each other's blood!</i>

1313
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,208
Here.

1314
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:20,833
<i>What will be today's result?</i>

1315
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:21,750
Does it hurt a lot?

1316
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:23,500
<i>Will this truly become</i>
<i>hell in a cell!</i>

1317
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:28,458
<i>This is where men mount</i>
<i>other men night after night!</i>

1318
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:30,125
<i>He tries to treat him like a kid--</i>

1319
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:32,583
What's all this violence?
Don't you watch films?

1320
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:33,791
I do.

1321
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:35,625
Okay.

1322
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:38,416
Who's your favorite actress?

1323
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,041
Tiger Shroff's my favorite.

1324
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,250
Favorite actress?

1325
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:44,333
Don't have one!

1326
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:47,791
Do you have a girlfriend?

1327
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,041
I don't like girls.

1328
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,375
Really?

1329
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:55,208
His teacher told me that
he kissed a girl in class.

1330
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,125
What's her name?

1331
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:00,250
Hey.

1332
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:03,250
-He kissed a girl?
-That's right!

1333
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:04,583
Anshu!

1334
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:10,375
<i>The bout which began aggressively</i>
<i>has seen everything now!</i>

1335
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:14,208
<i>But the defending champion</i>
<i>cannot escape humiliation now!</i>

1336
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:16,666
<i>And you thought he was</i>
<i>up against a kid!</i>

1337
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:19,875
Where have you been, man?
I poured myself a drink already.

1338
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:23,500
Sumi has a headache.
I just went to give her balm.

1339
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,541
Your brother-in-law's a doctor,
and you're depending on balm?

1340
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:29,791
No, I just--

1341
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:34,416
Let me have a look.
I'll fix the root cause of the pain!

1342
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,291
-What is it, migraine?
-No, not a migraine.

1343
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,333
Then what?

1344
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,958
It's just, since we got here.

1345
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:43,750
What?

1346
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:47,208
Everyone's after her to have a baby.
It's stressing her out.

1347
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,541
But they're right, aren't they?

1348
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,541
Tell me.

1349
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:56,500
It's almost a year since
you got married, right?

1350
01:20:58,875 --> 01:20:59,833
Look at me.

1351
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,791
First night, single shot.
Job done!

1352
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:05,416
She was like…

1353
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:09,916
It's my sister you're talking about!

1354
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,458
What?

1355
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,541
No! I'm not talking about…

1356
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,041
that kind of sex.

1357
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:21,750
Sex for procreation
doesn't count as sex anyway.

1358
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:25,416
It's a moral duty…

1359
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:27,500
towards your family.

1360
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:29,125
Understood?

1361
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:32,625
Let's have a drink?

1362
01:21:33,583 --> 01:21:34,708
Here's a piece of advice.

1363
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,750
Have a kid while you're still young.

1364
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:41,625
Or else imagine, you're
on your way to the funeral pyre,

1365
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:45,750
and your son is so small,
that he's clapping,

1366
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:49,208
"Papa is dead!
Papa is dead! Papa--"

1367
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:50,625
Now you're killing me?

1368
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,708
You're in some mood today.

1369
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:59,750
What's… Sumi's age, by the way?

1370
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,583
Sumi's… almost 32.

1371
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:05,291
Don't forget that…

1372
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:09,041
after a certain age, women
start having complications.

1373
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:14,166
By the way, your equipment's
working, right?

1374
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:19,291
Of course! I'm perfectly fine!

1375
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:21,583
What's the matter then?

1376
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:23,458
What is the problem?

1377
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:24,666
The problem, well…

1378
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:31,375
Come on, you can tell me.

1379
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:36,541
No, you'll tell someone.

1380
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:38,916
Of course not. I'm a doctor.

1381
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,875
Many patients confide in me.

1382
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,083
Tell me.

1383
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,291
I've never told this to anyone.

1384
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,041
Actually, I took Sumi to a doctor.

1385
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:03,458
He said that Sumi
can't have a child.

1386
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:05,625
She's barren?

1387
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,041
Please don't tell anyone.

1388
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,541
Of course not!

1389
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:15,958
Whom would I tell?

1390
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:27,041
-Hurry up, Nishi!
-Greetings.

1391
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:28,583
Where's she stuck?

1392
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:30,916
There…

1393
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:33,833
-Hey, Baby!
-See you!

1394
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:35,458
Come on!

1395
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:37,125
Do I have to come as well?

1396
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:39,416
Yes! Come, get inside.

1397
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:41,333
What will I do there?

1398
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,000
Come, quick!

1399
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:47,916
Why are we here?

1400
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:51,166
Just meeting the
doctor for two minutes.

1401
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,375
Then we'll go shopping.

1402
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,666
Looks like a boy to me.

1403
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:00,833
No, Mom. You were just
like this during Chutki.

1404
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,458
It's going to be a girl.

1405
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:03,500
Rekha!

1406
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,708
Let's go.

1407
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,458
Will all of you come along?

1408
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,208
Sumi, come.

1409
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,208
Come on.

1410
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:13,000
Why didn't you tell me?

1411
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:14,250
Tell you what?

1412
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:17,166
That you're having issues
regarding the "issue"!

1413
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,291
Issue?

1414
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:20,000
"Issue"!

1415
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,166
-Where are they?
-28…

1416
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:26,583
Call them and ask,
what's the issue?

1417
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:31,708
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Where are you?

1418
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:34,083
In the bathroom, giving a sample.

1419
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,125
Bathroom?

1420
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:39,041
Didn't you go to the market?
And, what sample?

1421
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,375
Urine sample?

1422
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,458
Why are you giving a
urine sample in the market?

1423
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:46,666
I'm not at the market.
I'm in a hospital bathroom…

1424
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,541
where I'm supposed
to give a urine sample.

1425
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,250
Why? What's the issue?

1426
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,583
Forgot what you did last night?

1427
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:54,041
You told your brother-in-law
that I can't get pregnant.

1428
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:56,166
<i>So, your family lied</i>
<i>and brought me here.</i>

1429
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,333
Now what?

1430
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,041
Hang up, what else!
Or will you help me pee?

1431
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:14,666
Couldn't hold it in, right?

1432
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:19,666
-Stop the car.
-Aunt.

1433
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,250
-I need to pee!
-Go on.

1434
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,708
Told you I wasn't needed.

1435
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,083
-Hang the flowers.
-No, give it to me.

1436
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:26,166
-Give me the lights!
-But you--

1437
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:28,833
-Shardul.
-I want to--

1438
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:32,875
I'll be back.

1439
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,625
Put it over here.

1440
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:45,750
-Get the other one.
-Okay.

1441
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,083
-Lower. Keep the gaps equal.
-There is a gap.

1442
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:50,000
-Shardul!
-The leaves as well.

1443
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:51,458
Shardul!

1444
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:53,250
Come down!

1445
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,000
Can't you see I'm busy?

1446
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:58,375
Will you come down,
or should I come up?

1447
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:01,125
Go downstairs, I'll come.

1448
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,500
Why are the flowers so dry?

1449
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,625
-Hey!
-Come down!

1450
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:09,041
I'll fall! What are you doing!

1451
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,250
Where will you run?

1452
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,375
I'm a sports teacher.
I run after kids all day!

1453
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:15,833
I have lots of stamina!

1454
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:18,875
What did you tell your brother-in-law?

1455
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:20,625
What did you say?

1456
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:22,875
Don't you think before you speak?

1457
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:23,916
Shardul, stop!

1458
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,750
Shardul Thakur, I said stop!

1459
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:31,750
This was your plan?

1460
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:32,916
Now everyone knows.

1461
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:35,375
Soon it'll be on your
"Thakur Rocks" WhatsApp group.

1462
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,791
What will you do
once the reports arrive?

1463
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:41,333
-Have you thought of that?
-Here you are!

1464
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:42,458
It's time for the prayer ceremony.

1465
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:45,166
And here's a gift for you.

1466
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,666
-Thank you, Auntie.
-And this is for you.

1467
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:49,541
Wear them.

1468
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:58,875
Consistent with the tested sample…

1469
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,583
this specimen--

1470
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:02,583
The reports are all fine!

1471
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:05,458
So, was Shardul lying?

1472
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:06,458
No!

1473
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:08,750
Our boy would never lie!

1474
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:10,208
Right, Baby?

1475
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:18,083
No.

1476
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:22,416
The girl must've said something.

1477
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:24,583
Whenever you bring up the baby,
she starts sulking.

1478
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:26,708
You think Shardul is a saint?

1479
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,666
I think they're hand-in-glove.

1480
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:30,291
But how?

1481
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,916
Ever seen them talk
nicely to one another?

1482
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:34,250
They're always fighting.

1483
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,375
Pihu has noticed as well.
Tell them?

1484
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:37,958
Yes! There's something fishy.

1485
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:40,041
I even offered them my room.

1486
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:41,458
They didn't even take it!

1487
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:43,875
-They sleep separately.
-Tell me.

1488
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:47,166
Which man keeps his hands
off his wife in the first year?

1489
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:55,458
I think one of us
needs to go to Dehradun…

1490
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:58,000
to keep a watch on them.

1491
01:27:58,625 --> 01:27:59,500
You go.

1492
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:04,916
I'm talking to you!

1493
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:06,416
You're his mother, for God's sake!

1494
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:09,416
Of course!

1495
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:19,416
-Alright, Auntie.
-God bless!

1496
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:22,750
Thank God the reports are fine.

1497
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:24,916
Next time we meet,

1498
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:28,208
the baby should be
in your arms, not your womb!

1499
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:31,583
Let's go!

1500
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:32,708
Yes.

1501
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:35,583
Someone take my bags, please!

1502
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,375
I'll help you.

1503
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:39,291
Where are you going?

1504
01:28:39,541 --> 01:28:41,541
-To keep watch!
-I will take it.

1505
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:45,708
She kept saying that she
wants to see her son's house!

1506
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:50,666
So I said, you don't need
anyone's permission! Go ahead!

1507
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:52,583
But what about her ticket?

1508
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:54,166
I got her a quota ticket.

1509
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:55,583
Pulled a few strings!

1510
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:58,833
Okay hurry up,
or you'll miss the train!

1511
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:02,041
Auntie, don't forget your BP medicine!

1512
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:03,416
What will we do now?

1513
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,916
Who are you calling?

1514
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,541
Don't we need to inform Rimjhim?

1515
01:29:06,666 --> 01:29:08,208
God knows what will happen now.

1516
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,041
Shall I sit in front?

1517
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:12,000
Keep in touch!

1518
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,500
Can't reach her.

1519
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,208
HALDWANI

1520
01:29:18,791 --> 01:29:21,166
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

1521
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:28,583
What's up?

1522
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,416
God knows why she's
switched off her phone!

1523
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:33,166
-That Timtim!
-Her name's Rimjhim!

1524
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,791
-Why don't you call her lab?
-I don't have the number.

1525
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:38,333
-Search the internet then!
-My data isn't working.

1526
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:40,583
-How the hell is it not working?
-What are you doing?

1527
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:05,416
Oh, yeah! Mine isn't working either.

1528
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:17,958
Sumi…

1529
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:22,250
Sumu!

1530
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,750
Give me her number.
I'll try calling her.

1531
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,291
If I knew it, would I be sitting
here twiddling my thumbs?

1532
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:37,583
Thank God, just the phone fell.

1533
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,208
What if I had fallen too?

1534
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,083
Look at the bright side!

1535
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:50,375
Sir, is the train on time?

1536
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,833
It'll reach in an hour.

1537
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:03,750
-<i>Jai hind</i>, sir.
-Hi, Naaznin.

1538
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,083
Hold on a second.

1539
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,125
Naaznin, you know Millennium Lab,
at the Jogiwallah crossing?

1540
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:12,166
Yes, sir.

1541
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,833
Okay, go there and ask for Rimjhim.

1542
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,291
Call me when you meet her.

1543
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,041
Who's Rimjhim?

1544
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:19,916
-She's a cousin.
-Whose cousin? Yours?

1545
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:24,000
Whether she's my cousin, your cousin,
Sumi's cousin or my Dad's cousin…

1546
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:26,375
who gives a shit!
Just do as I say!

1547
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:28,333
<i>Jai hind!</i>

1548
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:33,916
You still talk to Naaznin?

1549
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,791
She works with me at the station.

1550
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:37,666
Should I not maintain law and order?

1551
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:49,333
Hello, ma'am.
Does Rimjhim work here?

1552
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,250
What are we doing?

1553
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,416
We're waiting for a porter.

1554
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:04,666
Yeah, Naaznin.

1555
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,833
Yeah, give her the phone.

1556
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:11,750
Hello?

1557
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,458
I've been trying
to call you for hours.

1558
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:14,625
Why's your phone switched off?

1559
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:15,916
I'm getting my number ported.

1560
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Couldn't you do it another day?

1561
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:18,416
Was I supposed to
ask your permission?

1562
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:20,875
Listen, stop arguing now
and quickly pack your bags.

1563
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,250
-Mom's coming over.
-Whose Mom?

1564
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,791
God, my Mom!

1565
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,333
Nice try!

1566
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,125
I'm not lying, swear on my mum!

1567
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,833
-I don't trust you!
-What?

1568
01:32:39,916 --> 01:32:40,958
She wants to talk to you.

1569
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:48,291
She talks to Naaznin as well?

1570
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:52,041
Yeah, we're all friends now.

1571
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:56,416
Let's go.

1572
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:57,750
Let's go.

1573
01:32:58,791 --> 01:32:59,958
-Taxi?
-Yes, sir?

1574
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,416
-Are you available?
-Absolutely.

1575
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:03,875
Take it via the toll!

1576
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:06,875
But that's a longer route, sir.

1577
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,333
It'll have less traffic,
take it from there.

1578
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:12,166
I can take it via the clock
tower, it'll be quicker.

1579
01:33:12,416 --> 01:33:14,291
You'll teach a cop
what route to take?

1580
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:15,375
Show your ID!

1581
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:22,708
ID.

1582
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:25,458
Show it to him, not me!

1583
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:29,583
Okay, sir.

1584
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,333
One second, take this turn.

1585
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:37,500
No, actually take that turn.

1586
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:41,125
What are you doing?
Turn in your direction.

1587
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:47,541
No, go back!
Take that turn. What are you doing?

1588
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:48,750
We're stuck in traffic now!

1589
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:57,333
<i>Jai hind</i>, sir.

1590
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,083
-Yeah, tell me.
-<i>She's leaving, sir.</i>

1591
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,208
I've booked her an auto.

1592
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:02,125
Okay, great.
Thank you, Naaznin.

1593
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,666
<i>Jai hind.</i>

1594
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,083
Why are you taking such a long route?

1595
01:34:06,291 --> 01:34:07,416
Take this left, it's a shortcut.

1596
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:12,958
Sir, stop!

1597
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:18,750
We've reached, Mom!

1598
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:24,375
There's a beautiful park.
All facilities, no stress.

1599
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:29,916
Take it easy, Mom.

1600
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:31,875
SHARDUL THAKUR
S.I, UTTARAKHAND POLICE

1601
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,375
You are here!

1602
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:41,458
What the hell are you doing here!

1603
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:43,458
You scared me!

1604
01:34:44,916 --> 01:34:46,375
Mom's here! You--

1605
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:47,958
Breathe.

1606
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:50,583
I can't find my wallet.

1607
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:51,666
You are--

1608
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:54,541
Mom's here.
Get out!

1609
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:56,333
Actually, go inside!

1610
01:34:56,416 --> 01:34:57,875
-Don't step out!
-My wallet…

1611
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,625
-We're here.
-Hey--

1612
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,916
This isn't our house!

1613
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,416
-What?
-Our house is upstairs!

1614
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:07,916
It's been such a long vacation,
Sumi must be confused.

1615
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,375
-Which floor do you live on?
-Mom, let's go up.

1616
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:11,541
Let's go.

1617
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:13,625
My back hurts.

1618
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,625
Just a bit more.
Come on, Sumi!

1619
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,000
How could we forget our house!

1620
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:20,458
Don't know what's going on.
Can't remember anything nowadays!

1621
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:25,541
Mom, can you soak almonds
for me like you used to before?

1622
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:27,250
-Sumi, you must have them as well.
-Yes!

1623
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,500
They just melt in your mouth!

1624
01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:30,958
-How much further up?
-We're almost there.

1625
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:35,125
Who knows, one day Sumi
might forget I'm her husband!

1626
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,791
Here we are.

1627
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:41,416
-The terrace?
-We've reached?

1628
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:43,291
-It's the terrace!
-We have reached.

1629
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:46,291
Look Sumi, Mom!
We're on the terrace!

1630
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:49,416
-Wow, the terrace!
-What a beautiful view!

1631
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,583
Mom! Those mountains there,
that's Mussoorie!

1632
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,583
Do I have to trek
up to Mussoorie now?

1633
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:57,125
Of course not!

1634
01:35:58,958 --> 01:36:00,041
That tall building there…

1635
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:02,000
Already scaled a mountain…
I'm done.

1636
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:03,166
Our police station's right behind it.

1637
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,750
And behind that is our school!

1638
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:07,375
And Mom, that's-- Mom?

1639
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:11,416
That's the one!

1640
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:12,791
SHARDUL THAKUR
S.I, DEHRADUN POLICE

1641
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:24,750
Who's she?

1642
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:27,833
-She's--
-A cousin!

1643
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,041
Whose cousin?

1644
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:34,791
The DSP's wife…

1645
01:36:35,083 --> 01:36:37,375
Her cousin! She has the duplicate keys.

1646
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,833
-Yes.
-Oh.

1647
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:40,750
Right.

1648
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:44,958
They don't have a western
toilet, so she uses ours at times.

1649
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:48,958
How is ma'am?

1650
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:51,375
-She's good.
-Great!

1651
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:56,333
Oh, God!

1652
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:58,791
Take your time.

1653
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:07,708
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

1654
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:08,791
Bye!

1655
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:22,458
They stay in a tiny
room, with a small bed.

1656
01:37:22,583 --> 01:37:25,500
If it's a small bed, why
aren't they having a baby?

1657
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:34,458
Baby, you must talk to
Sumi's family about the issue.

1658
01:37:34,541 --> 01:37:36,291
They must bear some
responsibility as well!

1659
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:38,541
<i>And don't keep napping.</i>

1660
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,250
<i>Do what you've been sent to do.</i>

1661
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:42,500
Sumi.

1662
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:51,375
-Milk?
-Yes.

1663
01:37:51,791 --> 01:37:52,750
Drink up!

1664
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:55,083
-Namaste!
-Namaste.

1665
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:58,500
-This is Naaznin. She works with Shardul.
-Namaste.

1666
01:37:58,583 --> 01:37:59,916
This is my son, Zoheb.

1667
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,708
Children grow up so fast these days!

1668
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,000
Who knows when she will go?

1669
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,250
How is Mom?

1670
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:11,375
She's exactly like Shardul.
Just the same, no differ--

1671
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:18,750
Baby, listen to me.

1672
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:21,333
Just sit there and watch TV all night.

1673
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:22,583
Don't budge.

1674
01:38:23,458 --> 01:38:24,875
Watch any channel you want…

1675
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:27,125
You need me to tell you this as well?

1676
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:35,083
Mom!

1677
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:43,333
It's okay. We're all adults here.

1678
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:57,625
What are you up to? Go, sleep inside!

1679
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:58,791
Yes.

1680
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:03,208
But I'm not sleepy at all.

1681
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:06,375
I was watching this film.
I really like…

1682
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:09,083
Why are you snooping on us?

1683
01:39:10,416 --> 01:39:11,875
Will your sitting here help us conceive?

1684
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:14,416
We are trying.

1685
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:16,208
And if there's such a
hurry, we'll adopt a child!

1686
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,708
-Should we?
-Adopt a child?

1687
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,833
Adopt a child? Why?

1688
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:26,125
She'll lose her figure by
bearing one, that's why!

1689
01:39:26,291 --> 01:39:28,333
How will she flaunt her jeans then?

1690
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:31,708
Listen Baby. Enough of being a mother.

1691
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,541
It's time to be a mother-in-law!

1692
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:36,250
Be a mother-in-law? How?

1693
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:41,291
Baby, go and get a pen and paper.

1694
01:39:42,041 --> 01:39:43,875
Can't I get her to
speak to you directly?

1695
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:45,416
Just write!

1696
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:47,208
Okay, one minute.

1697
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:49,750
I'll note it down.

1698
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:55,750
Yes, tell me.

1699
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:09,416
Sumi, you should come home on time now.

1700
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:12,875
If you spend all your…

1701
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:16,208
energy in school, then

1702
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:19,541
what will be left for home and…

1703
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,500
And stop wearing
pant-shirt all the time.

1704
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,333
Doll up a little… because, you know…

1705
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:47,541
after all, it's a wife's duty
to entice her husband!

1706
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,583
Is there more?

1707
01:40:55,041 --> 01:40:56,125
Shall I read it?

1708
01:41:06,291 --> 01:41:07,333
It is--

1709
01:41:07,416 --> 01:41:09,666
Is the handwriting legible?

1710
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:15,208
"Turn off the lights while sleeping.

1711
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:18,625
-It's because--"
-"Even men feel shy at times!"

1712
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:26,750
-Can I keep this?
-Of course. It's for you, after all.

1713
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:36,375
Thank God!

1714
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:38,666
Just look at this!

1715
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,666
Like my school sends a circular…

1716
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,083
your family has sent this.

1717
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:43,708
A manual on "How To Have a Baby"!

1718
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:48,375
Prayers in the morning,

1719
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:50,958
adult talk in the evening,
and spying at night!

1720
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:53,375
They're after my life!

1721
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:55,833
She even spoke to my parents.

1722
01:41:55,958 --> 01:41:57,250
Now they're hounding me as well.

1723
01:42:01,166 --> 01:42:02,125
What did you tell them?

1724
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:06,125
Told them off, what else?

1725
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:07,833
I'm not like you!

1726
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:12,666
Going on and on about a baby.
How do I give them a baby?

1727
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:14,208
Should we have sex for them now?

1728
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:29,541
Should we?

1729
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:31,333
What?

1730
01:42:31,666 --> 01:42:33,250
Have sex.

1731
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:35,916
I mean a child.

1732
01:42:37,666 --> 01:42:39,291
Our families will stop cribbing.

1733
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:44,500
We could try.

1734
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,583
You want to have a child.
Basically you want to have sex?

1735
01:43:56,916 --> 01:43:58,541
I always had my doubts about him!

1736
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:00,583
-Quiet.
-I think he's Bi.

1737
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:02,416
He stares at me when I wear shorts.

1738
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,166
-I stare at you?
-Yes, you do!

1739
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:06,333
She roams around in such tiny shorts.

1740
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,333
I'm worried about what people will say!

1741
01:44:08,625 --> 01:44:10,333
And who are you calling "Bi"?

1742
01:44:10,416 --> 01:44:11,541
Who got drunk and forced her?

1743
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:13,708
I forced her? Will you say something?

1744
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:15,375
She's accusing me in public.

1745
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:16,791
My colleagues will throw me behind bars!

1746
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:17,958
They should!

1747
01:44:18,083 --> 01:44:19,833
All you do is talk rubbish
and make rubbish plans.

1748
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:21,125
So, my plan was rubbish?

1749
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:23,291
And what about you? Even made a plan?

1750
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:25,208
No, because you're brainless!

1751
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:26,416
You have dung for brains!

1752
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:27,833
Go make dung-cakes, not plans!

1753
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:29,875
What cakes?

1754
01:44:30,666 --> 01:44:31,666
Dung cake--

1755
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:34,791
Dried cakes of cow-dung used
as fuel, with fingerprints all over?

1756
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,041
Am I here to explain dung-cakes to you?

1757
01:44:37,416 --> 01:44:38,708
Go, make a better plan!

1758
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:07,875
-What are they doing?
-Ma'am, stop these guys!

1759
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:10,833
They can't marry like this!
It's illegal, right?

1760
01:45:10,916 --> 01:45:13,500
Don't get bothered.
They're just kids partying.

1761
01:45:13,583 --> 01:45:16,250
What party? It's a whole-ass
wedding procession!

1762
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:17,833
They're dancing and mocking our culture!

1763
01:45:17,916 --> 01:45:20,666
-Do you see a groom on a horse?
-Get back!

1764
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:23,250
Drums are played even during
India-Pakistan cricket matches!

1765
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:24,625
Have faith in the law.

1766
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:26,500
Such a marriage isn't
recognized by courts.

1767
01:45:26,583 --> 01:45:30,083
-Damn right, it isn't!
-Yeah, relax, why make a ruckus--

1768
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:31,083
Get back!

1769
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:36,875
Come, dance with me! Join the celebration!

1770
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,041
-Sir, that guy there.
-Yes.

1771
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,291
-Don't be shy, come on!
-Look at that guy.

1772
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:45,666
-Dance and enjoy!
-What's your problem?

1773
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:48,375
That guy looks high.
He'll cause trouble.

1774
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:50,708
He must be a junkie.

1775
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,541
Really? Dimri!

1776
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,166
Yes, sir?

1777
01:45:54,666 --> 01:45:56,541
Call that guy, the one in the jacket.

1778
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,208
Sir is calling you.

1779
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:03,708
Sir's calling you!

1780
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:30,750
Why are you wearing a mask?
Are you ashamed?

1781
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:41,250
Sir?

1782
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:42,750
Yes.

1783
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:46,375
Name?

1784
01:46:47,333 --> 01:46:48,291
Unnamed!

1785
01:46:50,916 --> 01:46:51,916
Title?

1786
01:46:52,625 --> 01:46:53,708
Tytler.

1787
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:59,500
Sir, he's definitely drunk.

1788
01:47:01,458 --> 01:47:03,125
-Are you drunk?
-No.

1789
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:05,083
Here, in my hand.

1790
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,666
Here. Blow, don't spit.

1791
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:34,875
<i>A turn upon a criss-cross path</i>

1792
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:40,791
<i>Fireflies flit a luminous swath</i>

1793
01:47:41,416 --> 01:47:46,666
<i>When impish eyes flout every rule</i>

1794
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:54,083
<i>Barriers break, mischief unspools</i>

1795
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:58,125
<i>The mind is hooked</i>

1796
01:47:58,625 --> 01:48:01,625
<i>This sucker-mind's hooked</i>

1797
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:04,208
<i>It's dazzled and shook</i>

1798
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:07,583
<i>This sucker-mind's hooked</i>

1799
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:10,291
<i>The mind is hooked</i>

1800
01:48:10,375 --> 01:48:13,083
<i>This sucker-mind's hooked</i>

1801
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:16,250
<i>It's dazzled and shook</i>

1802
01:48:16,333 --> 01:48:19,750
<i>This sucker-mind's hooked</i>

1803
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:25,208
<i>This love has me caught in a loop</i>

1804
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:30,541
<i>Let's hold hands and fly the coop</i>

1805
01:48:31,583 --> 01:48:36,791
<i>This love has me caught in a loop</i>

1806
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:44,000
<i>Let's hold hands and fly the coop</i>

1807
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:51,791
Mom?

1808
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:53,583
Mom!

1809
01:49:04,208 --> 01:49:05,291
Is this fine?

1810
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:09,541
Point number nine was
"entice your husband."

1811
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:10,666
So, will this work?

1812
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:13,541
Yes?

1813
01:49:13,666 --> 01:49:16,083
Yes? Then let's take a picture.

1814
01:49:16,333 --> 01:49:19,000
We can send it to Auntie.
Take a full-length one.

1815
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:23,416
-Let's not send it to her.
-Why?

1816
01:49:25,166 --> 01:49:26,708
-Should it be shorter?
-No, no, no!

1817
01:49:26,791 --> 01:49:30,916
-I can make it shorter. No worries!
-No! This is fine.

1818
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,541
The <i>kheer</i> is getting burnt.

1819
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:40,583
Mom, I've been following
all your instructions…

1820
01:49:40,666 --> 01:49:42,750
but it's futile.

1821
01:49:45,958 --> 01:49:47,125
Actually, Mom…

1822
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,916
it's your gun that's firing blanks.

1823
01:49:55,625 --> 01:49:56,708
What?

1824
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:58,541
You know what I mean?

1825
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,416
Your young gun…

1826
01:50:03,833 --> 01:50:04,958
Shardul.

1827
01:50:16,125 --> 01:50:17,916
Oh, wow, <i>kheer</i>!

1828
01:50:22,166 --> 01:50:23,166
What happened?

1829
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:24,916
Couldn't resist overeating?

1830
01:50:25,708 --> 01:50:26,875
Okay then, go take a run.

1831
01:50:33,583 --> 01:50:34,625
Will you have some?

1832
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:43,375
Mom, what happened?

1833
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:48,458
What happened? What--

1834
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,333
Sumi? Mom?

1835
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:51,375
Sumi?

1836
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:52,708
Sumi!

1837
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:54,791
Sumi!

1838
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:59,041
I'm looking for you all over
and you're here, jogging!

1839
01:50:59,125 --> 01:51:00,083
What?

1840
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:01,833
Drop the act!

1841
01:51:02,208 --> 01:51:04,041
Mom told me.
You lied about me to her!

1842
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,333
So? You also told
everyone that I was infertile.

1843
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:09,458
So, is this revenge?

1844
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:11,791
I made a good plan.

1845
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,541
It didn't work, but it
was well intended!

1846
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:15,833
What the hell is this?
What have you done!

1847
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,250
Why are you getting so stressed?
This time, the plan will work.

1848
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:21,416
The report will say
your sperm count is low.

1849
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:22,875
My sperm count?

1850
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:26,708
We'll leave on Sunday, right?
My sperm count?

1851
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:28,125
Have you seen my family?

1852
01:51:28,458 --> 01:51:30,458
We're like a child-rearing factory!

1853
01:51:30,875 --> 01:51:33,125
Papa was in the forces,
so he wasn't home often.

1854
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:34,708
Or I would've had a bunch of siblings!

1855
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:36,041
My sperm count!

1856
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:41,791
Dude, your test will happen
in Rimjhim's lab, right?

1857
01:51:42,208 --> 01:51:46,041
So? Do men's sperm counts
dry up in Rimjhim's lab?

1858
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:49,333
You're just like your mother!

1859
01:51:53,541 --> 01:51:55,625
But who is Shardul firing at?

1860
01:51:56,333 --> 01:51:58,250
Shardul, if the test
happens in Rimjhim's lab,

1861
01:51:58,333 --> 01:52:00,875
then the results will
be in her control, right?

1862
01:52:12,458 --> 01:52:14,958
But that's illegal! And I'm a cop!

1863
01:52:19,375 --> 01:52:21,500
And then you'll prove that I'm impotent?

1864
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:24,416
I'm not impotent. Important--

1865
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,375
It's very important that we go!

1866
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:29,875
I'm not impotent, Sumi!

1867
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:41,000
-I'll stay at my folks' today.
-Why?

1868
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:44,583
Your report arrives today,
I might burst out laughing.

1869
01:52:46,541 --> 01:52:47,791
Did you pass the test?

1870
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:51,541
It's not a civil services exam!

1871
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:54,291
I saw your report, buddy.

1872
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:58,375
Man, there's no scope
of passing the test.

1873
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:07,333
Don't be disheartened…

1874
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,333
I've spoken to everyone.

1875
01:53:10,875 --> 01:53:12,208
And they've agreed.

1876
01:53:13,166 --> 01:53:14,208
Agreed to what?

1877
01:53:19,083 --> 01:53:21,583
Sumi, Shardul's here!

1878
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,583
It's all God's will.

1879
01:53:30,708 --> 01:53:32,208
We just found out.

1880
01:53:36,333 --> 01:53:38,041
It hasn't shrunk.

1881
01:53:40,666 --> 01:53:42,000
Oh, his heart!

1882
01:53:42,583 --> 01:53:44,166
Don't let this shrink your heart, son.

1883
01:53:46,375 --> 01:53:47,500
Tonsils?

1884
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,958
No, it's just her ritual vow of silence!

1885
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:52,375
What are you doing here?

1886
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:55,333
Can we talk?

1887
01:53:55,916 --> 01:53:57,208
-Please go ahead.
-Come.

1888
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:02,000
Shrink-- Your brain has shrunk!

1889
01:54:02,458 --> 01:54:03,458
What happened?

1890
01:54:03,583 --> 01:54:05,708
-I kind of screwed up.
-What now?

1891
01:54:06,708 --> 01:54:08,916
You know how Mom
was always snooping on us…

1892
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,708
-Yes.
-and you were really stressed.

1893
01:54:11,875 --> 01:54:14,750
So one night, I just told her…

1894
01:54:16,083 --> 01:54:17,458
Now what did you tell her?

1895
01:54:18,583 --> 01:54:21,208
Didn't you once say that
we could adopt a child.

1896
01:54:21,291 --> 01:54:22,208
Yes?

1897
01:54:22,666 --> 01:54:27,125
So, everyone's now on
board with the idea of adoption.

1898
01:54:30,333 --> 01:54:31,458
They agreed?

1899
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:40,250
We can adopt a kid?

1900
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:42,250
Yeah.

1901
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:45,000
Did you really want a child?

1902
01:54:45,125 --> 01:54:47,500
Of course, since forever!

1903
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:48,916
Really?

1904
01:54:49,666 --> 01:54:50,750
Why, you don't want one?

1905
01:54:51,916 --> 01:54:54,916
No, I mean I never
really thought about it.

1906
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:57,583
It wasn't really possible, so…

1907
01:54:59,791 --> 01:55:03,416
Sumi! I'm so happy!

1908
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:08,958
Yeah?

1909
01:55:10,833 --> 01:55:12,250
NIBHA DEVI PANT ADOPTION CENTER

1910
01:55:12,333 --> 01:55:15,083
The adoption process is online now.

1911
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:18,458
That's the official website.

1912
01:55:19,458 --> 01:55:22,000
You both can fill in your details on it.

1913
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:24,041
Anyway, your case is genuine.

1914
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:26,666
So, I think you should be
able to adopt a baby soon.

1915
01:55:27,041 --> 01:55:28,041
Thank you, sir.

1916
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,083
Here it goes.

1917
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:35,833
Oh, she's hungry.

1918
01:55:35,916 --> 01:55:38,541
Yes, looks like it.

1919
01:55:39,083 --> 01:55:40,208
Shall we go?

1920
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:41,375
She is looking at you.

1921
01:55:41,458 --> 01:55:43,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1922
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:51,458
Bye.

1923
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:53,416
-Bye, Varnika!
-Bye.

1924
01:56:00,125 --> 01:56:01,250
To Junior Thakur!

1925
01:56:02,416 --> 01:56:04,416
Why Thakur? Why not Singh?

1926
01:56:05,791 --> 01:56:07,458
-The child gets the Dad's surname!
-Hey!

1927
01:56:07,958 --> 01:56:08,833
Why?

1928
01:56:08,916 --> 01:56:10,958
-It will be my child as well.
-Absolutely!

1929
01:56:11,291 --> 01:56:12,708
In that case, he's the Dad as well!

1930
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,333
No.

1931
01:56:15,416 --> 01:56:17,583
I'm only interested in Senior Thakur!

1932
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:21,708
Okay enough, it's a public place.

1933
01:56:26,166 --> 01:56:27,250
Sumi.

1934
01:56:33,791 --> 01:56:34,958
Let me tell you…

1935
01:56:35,958 --> 01:56:39,500
I'll be a… very strict Dad.

1936
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:52,500
-Mom, hurry up!
-It's already on the move!

1937
01:56:52,583 --> 01:56:54,000
-Run faster!
-This--

1938
01:56:54,083 --> 01:56:56,875
-How much faster? It's gone!
-Hey!

1939
01:56:57,208 --> 01:56:58,416
Let it be now.

1940
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:02,583
You barely brought anything.
How long does it take you to pack?

1941
01:57:02,666 --> 01:57:05,416
Why are you so hassled?
As if you booked the ticket.

1942
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:08,000
Anup did it, he'll do it again.
I'll let him know.

1943
01:57:08,083 --> 01:57:10,333
Yeah, Anup can do everything, right?
It's not that easy.

1944
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:13,166
I was just texting you.
You've got to leave.

1945
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:15,666
-Why?
-We missed the train. Mom's with me.

1946
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:17,875
Hello, Auntie!

1947
01:57:18,125 --> 01:57:19,708
Oh, no! You missed the train!

1948
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:23,500
Well, at least I got a
chance to meet you.

1949
01:57:24,666 --> 01:57:26,833
-Won't you introduce us?
-He's my friend, Guru.

1950
01:57:28,291 --> 01:57:29,833
So, you're old friends?

1951
01:57:29,916 --> 01:57:31,416
No, we met pretty recently.

1952
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:32,958
But we became really thick very soon.

1953
01:57:33,583 --> 01:57:35,333
Almost like a married couple!

1954
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:40,250
You see, I'm a lawyer, he's a cop.

1955
01:57:40,375 --> 01:57:41,958
It's a love-hate relationship…

1956
01:57:42,041 --> 01:57:43,250
just like husband and wife.

1957
01:57:43,333 --> 01:57:44,416
Right, Tiger?

1958
01:57:47,958 --> 01:57:49,333
So, you met in court?

1959
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:51,291
No! At Amit and Harsh's wedding.

1960
01:57:51,375 --> 01:57:54,458
-Amita and Harsh's wedding!
-Amita?

1961
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:57,291
Yeah, poor Amita.
He keeps calling her Amit!

1962
01:57:57,666 --> 01:58:01,208
How come you never told me about him?

1963
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:02,916
Yeah, I…

1964
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:07,333
Auntie, you know what!
I don't believe in hiding my feelings.

1965
01:58:07,666 --> 01:58:10,041
-Oh, God!
-We've reached.

1966
01:58:10,125 --> 01:58:11,750
Wait, we're still talking!

1967
01:58:13,333 --> 01:58:14,625
Hold on.

1968
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:19,958
Can I call you Mom?

1969
01:58:22,625 --> 01:58:24,041
I lost my mother, you see.

1970
01:58:26,083 --> 01:58:29,125
-Of course, you can call me Mom!
-Mom!

1971
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:31,000
How sweet!

1972
01:58:31,291 --> 01:58:32,416
Come, Mom.

1973
01:58:33,625 --> 01:58:35,666
Please come.
Have a cup of tea.

1974
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:37,375
Oh, no!
He's getting very late.

1975
01:58:38,166 --> 01:58:40,458
-You carry on, I'll get your luggage.
-Alright then.

1976
01:58:40,875 --> 01:58:42,791
-See you later, Mom!
-Yes.

1977
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,375
What the hell was that?

1978
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:46,333
I was just pulling your leg!

1979
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:48,000
Why, can't I?

1980
01:58:49,666 --> 01:58:51,000
Can't I?

1981
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,333
You're pointlessly getting hyper!

1982
01:58:53,833 --> 01:58:55,333
So today's plan is…

1983
01:58:55,583 --> 01:58:58,916
No, why? I'll be right back.

1984
01:58:59,666 --> 01:59:00,833
Wait.

1985
01:59:25,291 --> 01:59:26,208
What happened?

1986
02:00:12,666 --> 02:00:13,625
What?

1987
02:00:41,541 --> 02:00:42,666
Yeah.

1988
02:00:43,791 --> 02:00:44,750
Sumi…

1989
02:00:45,708 --> 02:00:48,833
don't tell them about me.

1990
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:50,791
Please.

1991
02:01:08,291 --> 02:01:09,291
Pervert.

1992
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:12,416
What did you just say?

1993
02:01:15,541 --> 02:01:17,916
Say it again! I dare you!

1994
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,041
Isn't that what you really are?

1995
02:01:21,166 --> 02:01:23,000
What do I tell my friends,
that my sister's a lesbian?

1996
02:01:23,916 --> 02:01:25,000
Sick freak!

1997
02:01:25,458 --> 02:01:28,000
Watch your mouth,
or I'll smash your face!

1998
02:01:28,083 --> 02:01:29,750
You'll teach him how to behave?

1999
02:01:30,125 --> 02:01:32,083
-You?
-He's ten years younger than me!

2000
02:01:32,708 --> 02:01:34,708
How can he talk to me like that?

2001
02:01:40,125 --> 02:01:42,458
Look at her! Just look at her.

2002
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:45,333
She doesn't have an ounce of shame!

2003
02:01:48,166 --> 02:01:49,083
Lower your eyes.

2004
02:01:50,333 --> 02:01:51,416
Lower them!

2005
02:01:54,958 --> 02:01:58,708
You've been cheating
your parents all your life.

2006
02:02:00,208 --> 02:02:01,500
Why didn't you just die?

2007
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:03,125
I wish you died!

2008
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,833
Will you say something?

2009
02:02:15,291 --> 02:02:16,750
Why are you silent?

2010
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:22,916
I'm going to the shop.

2011
02:02:30,833 --> 02:02:34,458
What happened at home today,
it didn't surprise me one bit.

2012
02:02:35,458 --> 02:02:38,583
I had replayed this situation
in my head so many times.

2013
02:02:40,458 --> 02:02:42,791
How all of you would react…

2014
02:02:42,875 --> 02:02:44,875
whether you'd even understand me.

2015
02:02:45,875 --> 02:02:47,833
Everything Mom said today,

2016
02:02:48,583 --> 02:02:50,666
I felt I had heard it before.

2017
02:02:51,708 --> 02:02:54,166
I felt really mad at Naman…

2018
02:02:54,250 --> 02:02:57,708
but I knew he'd probably
say something like that.

2019
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:04,708
But when it came to you…

2020
02:03:06,583 --> 02:03:09,666
I thought that like always,
you'll wrap me in a hug and say,

2021
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:12,583
"Sumi, no matter what happens…

2022
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:16,958
no matter what the world
says, your Papa has your back."

2023
02:03:29,916 --> 02:03:31,500
You're struggling to say it, right?

2024
02:03:36,958 --> 02:03:38,375
I understand.

2025
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:46,208
But can't you still say it
once, just for my sake?

2026
02:03:48,208 --> 02:03:49,625
Please, Papa?

2027
02:03:57,083 --> 02:03:58,083
Scold me…

2028
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,083
if you're angry.

2029
02:04:08,416 --> 02:04:10,291
But please don't be like this?

2030
02:04:13,416 --> 02:04:15,250
Please say something, Papa.

2031
02:04:24,666 --> 02:04:26,208
Why did it have to be us?

2032
02:05:14,166 --> 02:05:16,833
Man, you're an experienced guy.

2033
02:05:17,208 --> 02:05:18,166
How could you not sense it?

2034
02:05:19,375 --> 02:05:21,041
Even while getting intimate?

2035
02:05:28,458 --> 02:05:30,500
Did anything even
happen between you two?

2036
02:05:33,416 --> 02:05:35,125
What kind of policeman are you?

2037
02:05:35,541 --> 02:05:39,041
You were being robbed in broad
daylight, and you just sat quiet.

2038
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:45,125
He was quietly suffering for her sins.

2039
02:05:46,875 --> 02:05:49,666
I changed my clothes so
many times in front of her!

2040
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:50,833
Imagine…

2041
02:05:51,291 --> 02:05:52,958
she used to sleep next to me!

2042
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:54,750
I feel repulsed thinking of it.

2043
02:05:55,875 --> 02:05:58,375
Even Homeopathy has
no cure for this disease.

2044
02:06:01,791 --> 02:06:03,208
What?

2045
02:06:05,041 --> 02:06:07,583
Do you all hear yourself?

2046
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,750
You feel repulsed. Why?

2047
02:06:18,291 --> 02:06:19,750
And you're a doctor, Brother-in-law.

2048
02:06:20,666 --> 02:06:22,625
You should at least
know this isn't a disease.

2049
02:06:24,333 --> 02:06:25,541
It's perfectly natural.

2050
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:34,166
No one asks you to decide and
choose between men and women.

2051
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:36,875
The feeling comes from within, right?

2052
02:06:38,916 --> 02:06:40,750
God created them this way.

2053
02:06:45,583 --> 02:06:47,958
Homosexuals are as human as all of you.

2054
02:06:54,625 --> 02:06:55,875
And you know…

2055
02:06:58,083 --> 02:06:59,000
who Sumi is?

2056
02:07:01,375 --> 02:07:02,791
She's a really nice girl.

2057
02:07:05,291 --> 02:07:06,541
She hasn't cheated me.

2058
02:07:09,625 --> 02:07:10,833
I knew everything.

2059
02:07:17,708 --> 02:07:20,000
This big family of mine…

2060
02:07:23,583 --> 02:07:25,625
it's always given me
more love than I deserve.

2061
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:35,208
And yet I've… always felt alone.

2062
02:07:35,583 --> 02:07:37,708
I could never share
my truth with anyone.

2063
02:07:39,083 --> 02:07:40,375
There was no one…

2064
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:44,708
other than her.

2065
02:07:55,708 --> 02:07:58,791
So, if you're so repulsed by her…

2066
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:02,083
you should be repulsed by me as well.

2067
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:08,708
If you think she's sick…

2068
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:12,916
Then I'm sick as well.

2069
02:08:18,416 --> 02:08:21,958
Because gay, homo, homosexuals…

2070
02:08:22,041 --> 02:08:24,000
whatever you want to call it…

2071
02:08:26,208 --> 02:08:27,208
it…

2072
02:08:30,125 --> 02:08:31,250
I am that as well.

2073
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:36,666
I'm gay.

2074
02:09:32,166 --> 02:09:33,125
Hello?

2075
02:09:34,083 --> 02:09:35,166
<i>Hello, Shardul?</i>

2076
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:37,500
I can't hear you.

2077
02:09:40,416 --> 02:09:41,416
<i>Hello?</i>

2078
02:09:56,666 --> 02:09:57,625
Hello.

2079
02:09:58,583 --> 02:09:59,625
Sumi, I told them.

2080
02:10:01,625 --> 02:10:02,750
I told everyone.

2081
02:10:40,041 --> 02:10:42,416
Shardul, I'll call you later.

2082
02:10:42,583 --> 02:10:45,583
In the evening, okay?
It's time for my class.

2083
02:10:46,458 --> 02:10:48,750
Yeah, alright.

2084
02:12:15,791 --> 02:12:21,250
<i>Our world is just as beautiful</i>

2085
02:12:21,666 --> 02:12:26,166
<i>As we are within</i>

2086
02:12:27,583 --> 02:12:30,541

2095

2097

2099
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:37,583
<i>From the sea drawn</i>

2100
02:13:37,666 --> 02:13:41,125
<i>Lifted off the dawn</i>

2101
02:13:41,291 --> 02:13:44,166
<i>A color sweet</i>

2102
02:13:44,291 --> 02:13:47,166
<i>A savory treat</i>

2103
02:13:47,291 --> 02:13:50,125
<i>The color of the moon</i>

2104
02:13:50,291 --> 02:13:52,916
<i>From a star strewn</i>

2105
02:14:03,833 --> 02:14:06,916
DON'T BE AFRAID TO FALL IN LOVE

02:16:23,916 --> 02:16:26,000
The DSP's wife really misses you.

2125
02:16:26,708 --> 02:16:28,666
Keeps asking, "Where's Sumi?"

2126
02:16:28,791 --> 02:16:31,416
Really? What did you tell her?

2127
02:16:31,916 --> 02:16:35,041
The truth! That you're a hoe
who ran off with her cousin!

2128
02:16:39,291 --> 02:16:41,500
-Did you get the message?
-What message?

2129
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:44,750
We have an appointment on Monday,
2:00 p.m. with the divorce counselor.

2130
02:16:47,666 --> 02:16:49,458
Am I such a bad husband,
that you're divorcing me?

2131
02:16:51,625 --> 02:16:53,041
Actually I got a message as well.

2132
02:16:54,583 --> 02:16:57,250
Our adoption application
has been approved.

2133
02:17:03,083 --> 02:17:05,000
Couldn't you avoid
getting caught a bit longer?

2134
02:17:05,958 --> 02:17:07,125
At least we would have a child.

2135
02:17:19,666 --> 02:17:22,000
Sumi and I have decided
not to get divorced.

2136
02:17:23,583 --> 02:17:24,583
We'll live together like before…

2137
02:17:25,875 --> 02:17:26,958
as husband and wife.

2138
02:17:27,833 --> 02:17:30,625
Because we both want a
child, we're adopting a baby.

2139
02:17:31,791 --> 02:17:34,750
Single women can adopt,
but because I'm lesbian,

2140
02:17:34,833 --> 02:17:36,458
I don't have the legal right to.

2141
02:17:36,625 --> 02:17:37,791
So, we're adopting together.

2142
02:17:39,375 --> 02:17:43,833
Our country's law says that only
"normal" married couples can adopt.

2143
02:17:45,666 --> 02:17:48,041
Now how do we convince everyone
that we are as normal as anyone.

2144
02:17:50,041 --> 02:17:56,000
Now it's up to you whether you
want to accept our marriage or not.

2145
02:17:56,458 --> 02:17:59,541
This marriage was a compromise
before, and it remains a compromise.

2146
02:18:00,833 --> 02:18:02,250
Earlier it was because of all of you,

2147
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,625
and now because of the law.

2148
02:18:28,916 --> 02:18:30,833
-Please sit.
-Okay.

2149
02:18:32,208 --> 02:18:33,708
King-King can happen.

2150
02:18:34,125 --> 02:18:36,541
King-Queen can happen.
But Queen-Queen can't happen.

2151
02:18:37,666 --> 02:18:38,666
But these two?

2152
02:18:39,125 --> 02:18:40,166
They're women.

2153
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,625
I was talking about men.

2154
02:18:43,291 --> 02:18:44,541
-Shall we begin?
-Absolutely.

2155
02:18:44,833 --> 02:18:46,625
Parents, please extend their hands.

2156
02:18:55,041 --> 02:18:56,333
Please continue, sir.

2157
02:18:57,708 --> 02:18:58,958
Fold your hands.

2158
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,208
-Go there.
-Namaste. Please come.

2159
02:19:21,291 --> 02:19:23,083
The ceremony's still on?

2160
02:19:25,291 --> 02:19:27,500
-Have a seat.
-Namaste.

2161
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:33,500
Tea?

2162
02:19:34,083 --> 02:19:35,291
No, I don't--

2163
02:20:13,791 --> 02:20:14,916
Rimjhim.

2164
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:17,583
Rimjhim.

2165
02:20:19,458 --> 02:20:20,541
Go sit next to Sumi.

2166
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:25,458
Go!

2167
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:27,458
Go on.

2168
02:20:27,875 --> 02:20:29,791
A mother must be
present at the ceremony.

2169
02:21:00,416 --> 02:21:03,958
Mr. Tytler, you also come and sit.

2170
02:21:06,208 --> 02:21:08,916
I'm not asking you to be a father.
I just want you by my side.
