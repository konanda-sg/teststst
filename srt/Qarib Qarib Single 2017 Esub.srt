00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,080
<i>My heart is racing</i>

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
The same complaints, mom!

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,280
How do you expect dad
not to eat the <i>payasam</i> you make?

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,080
Do I need to come to Trivandrum
to deal with this?

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>Come over.</i>

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,960
Don't post my pictures
on that WhatsApp group.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,680
Aunt picked my brains over it
for half an hour.

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,880
"You're looking so beautiful.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,400
-Are you seeing someone?"
-Jaya!

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,000
Come on.

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,040
Mom, I'll call you later. Bye!

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,720
You're looking so lovely!

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,520
I am actually getting married.

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,160
Who'd have thought I'd find
a husband on <i>Tinder</i>?

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
Especially in this suit.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,800
It's been ten years now.

17
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,440
<i>My near and dear ones</i>

18
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,600
<i>Are far away</i>

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,000
Here.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,320
<i>My near and dear ones</i>

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,320
<i>Are far away</i>

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,000
Can I get the bill?

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,800
Two hundred and forty rupees.

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,840
<i>My near and dear ones are far away</i>

25
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,360
<i>I brew my own cup of tea</i>

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
<i>Do my own shopping</i>

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
<i>I compliment myself</i>

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,440
<i>I'm lonesome and lonely</i>

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,880
<i>I chat with myself</i>

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
<i>Keep myself busy, running pillar to post</i>

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
<i>Take myself on long drives</i>

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,200
<i>I'm lonesome and lonely</i>

33
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,320
<i>Night and day in the balcony</i>

34
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,560
<i>I wave an electric racket</i>
<i>To slay mosquitoes</i>

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,360
<i>No one comes to meet me!</i>

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,680
<i>My near and dear ones are far away</i>

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,080
I hope you're eating well.

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,320
Just because there's no one
to prod you...

39
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
<i>And what's this act about being sick?</i>

40
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,200
<i>That's why you're in my room.</i>

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
Get lost, kid!

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,840
I've finally got my freedom.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,600
<i>I'd like to drive someone crazy, too</i>

44
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,160
<i>I'd like to be the reason for desire, too</i>

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,160
<i>Stay up talking through the night</i>

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,400
<i>In this big, bad world</i>

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,800
<i>No one to call my own, dammit</i>

48
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,720
<i>Lights out on romance!</i>

49
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,520
<i>It's me, it's me</i>
<i>Lonesome and lonely!</i>

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>Cloaked in the blues</i>

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,120
<i>I'm lonesome and lonely!</i>

52
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,320
<i>The broken pieces of my heart!</i>

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,480
<i>My near and dear ones</i>

54
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,880
<i>Are far away</i>

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,040
<i>My near and dear ones are far away</i>

56
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,320
Mukesh, I want that report in an hour.

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,800
<i>Open your heart for love</i>

58
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,080
<i>Don't be lonely!</i>

59
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
Your brother was around all this while.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,440
Eventually your friends' kids
will leave the nest too.

61
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,600
And Komal's cat.
What's her name?

62
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,920
-Zinky?
-Zinky.

63
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,160
She'll also go to heaven in a few years.

64
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,120
When will you stop making excuses?

65
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,240
-What if you become a virgin again?
-What?

66
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,480
The gates can grow back, girl!

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
What gates...

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,920
That guy, Saurabh. Remember?

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,480
He's still single.

70
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,600
-Why don't you meet him?
-He wants to remain single.

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,680
There's a new girl
on his profile picture every week.

72
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,680
Oh, you've already stalked him?

73
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,320
Just get some extracurricular action.

74
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,160
You have the whole house to yourself.

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
But the diary is chockablock.

76
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,160
Yes, of course.
What a blemish on your record!

77
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,240
Go ahead, spend your whole life
insuring others' lives.

78
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,680
Don't live for yourself.

79
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,680
Jaya!

Bloody!

Still Single

89
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,799

<i>MA?</i>

91
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,040
<i>Will you teach me a thing or two?</i>

92

<i>What does TK mean?</i>

93
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,600
<i>Do erotic postures interest you?</i>

"Your profile is very different
from the others.

95
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,040
I'd like to meet you if that's possible.

96
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,280
If you find my profile acceptable,
let me know.

97
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,200
We can give a coffee shop some business.

98
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,880
Yogi."

99
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,960
Meena!

100
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,600
I have to attend an event.

101
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,480
Didn't you recommend a hair treatment?

102
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
Hey, Jaya!

103
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,960
-Weren't you here last week, too?
-Yes.

104
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,120
What's cooking? You seem to be visiting
the salon a lot.

105
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,360
Some important office meeting?

106
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,440
No. I'm just learning a thing
or two from you, Mrs. Saluja.

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Meena...

108
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,200
My eyebrows and upper lip as well.

109
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,560
But, didn't you do your
upper lip just last week?

110
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes.

111
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,400
Yes.

112
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,600
Okay.

113
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
In Mumbai?

114
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,080
My brother's studying at Princeton.

115
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,560
I have a lot of friends.

116
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,640
I won't be able to babysit today.

117
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
I'll take them to shopping tomorrow.

118
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,560
Come on.

119
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,400
Ms. Jayashree?

120
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,680
This is so mean of you.

121
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,120
The others get turned off looking at me.
You were leaving without even seeing me.

122
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
You are?

123
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,600
Didn't you recognize me?

124
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,960
I recognized you from your eyes.
Come on.

125
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,760
Time to rest my legs.
I've had a good work out.

126
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
-Let's go in.
-Yes.

127
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,880
Come on.

128
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,240
-Here?
-This table, please?

129
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,240
You made me run an extra 50 meters today.

130
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,280
Do you go for a run every day?

131
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Yes, ma'am. I make a round
of Carter Road every day.

132
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,640
Training for the marathon.

133
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
-Marathon?
-Yes.

134
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,440
But, Carter Road is barely two kilometers.

135
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,280
Who wants to run
the whole marathon, Ms. Jayashree?

136
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,960
I haven't been punished.

137
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,480
I'll run a little.
Then back to home.

138
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,120
Then I'll watch the results on TV.

139
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,800
Find out who ran so much!

140
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,800
Welcome, mate.

141
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
What will you have?

142
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
-Get us two lattes.
-Yes.

143
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,480
That's two mugs of lattes,
but we don't want to get mugged.

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
You are a chemical engineer?

145
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Yes, people would say that.

146
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
What do you mean?

147
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,480
I've studied cylinders and pipes,
but I don't work with them.

148
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,600
So what do you do?

149
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,600
I don't do anything.

150
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,960
It just came to my mind.

151
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,280
They choose their profession
but call themselves tortured slaves

152
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,320
If I may recite, with your permission.

153
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,600
They choose their profession
but call themselves tortured slaves

154
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,000
But lovers like me
are willing slaves to poetry.

155
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,320
Kudos to me!

156
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,080
I thought poetry was just a hobby.

157
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,080
My first girlfriend would call me
Sir Poet, Ms. Jayashree.

158
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,840
I go by the pseudonym of Viyogi.

159
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,720
I have published six books.

160
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,760
-Really?
-Yes.

161
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
-Oh.
-None of them sold.

162
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
I gave them for free to friends.
Idiots didn't read a leaf.

163
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,040
It's the age of the Internet.
Who reads these days?

164
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,760
Poets like me are thirsting for praise.

165
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,960
This same couplet on Facebook

166
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,160
would've fetched you thousands of likes.

167
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,120
I don't know much about Facebook,

168
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,560
but you get one big like!

169
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,040
Tell me, Ms. Jayashree TK.

170
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,280
How come a woman like you still single?

171
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,280
Were you busy with work,

172
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,440
or was it heartbreak?

173
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,400
-Here's your order.
-Thank you, mate.

174
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,280
-Online dating for the first time?
-Yeah.

175
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,160
There aren't many worth meeting.

176
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,720
There was an assault
of cheap messages last night.

177
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,160
Really?

178
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,880
-Yes.
-Let's have a look!

179
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,960
Come on, log into the website,

180
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,680
I'll straighten them out.

181
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,160
Why is it okay?

182
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,280
I never thought they could stoop so low.
These men!

183
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,760
I'd like to know. Come on.

184
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
Your voice is hesitant,
but your fingers are expressive.

185
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,280
Would you please look the other way?

186
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,600
Why? What's there?

187
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,200
Oh I see!

188
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm just saying.

189
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,560
"Exciting eyes!
Can I see a picture of your lips, too?"

190
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,480
What's this other guy saying?

191
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,880
Let's go to a disco and grind our hips.
Damn!

192
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,240
Let me look at this.

193
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,280
I'll sort him out.

194
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,400
-You...
-What are you doing?

195
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,800
Your eyes are fascinating, too.

196
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,840
Just a minute.

197
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,520
-Would you please type? I'm slow.
-Okay.

198
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,520
-Your eyes are exciting, too.
-Fine.

199
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,840
Meet me at Vashi station tomorrow
at 9.30 a.m., near the phone booth.

200
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,240
I'll be waiting. Muah!

201
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,520
Just type that. Okay?

202
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,960
We'll send the hip grinder even further!

203
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,600
We'll send him to Khandala.
Just type it.

204
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,800
I don't want to go, Mr. Yogi.

205
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,480
You don't have to meet them.
They'll come to meet you.

206
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,120
They'll say hello to someone
with pretty eyes.

207
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,480
They may get slapped. It will be fun!

208
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,160
Come on. Get those fingers to work.

209
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,359
Has the doctor forbidden you
from having fun?

210
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,560
What do you have to lose?

211
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,000
They'll come and wait.
What happened?

212
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,040
It means I'm going to
have to delete my profile.

213
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,119
So where would you like to go for dinner?

214
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,720
No...

215
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,839
I know a very...
Don't stop those fingers.

216
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,319
Call the hip grinder to Khandala
under the bridge at 11.

217
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,480
Told him?

218
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,800
What are your feelings
toward char-grilled lamb?

219
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
Very negative feelings.

220
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,200
Ah! So sorry to hear that.

221
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,520
Shall we have a sandwich here?

222
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,080
Sandwich for dinner?

223
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,320
How about some poison instead?

224
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,920
There's a great restaurant,
it's Friday night.

225
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,560
There's great food, great music.

226
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
How did you get here?
By cab or rickshaw?

227
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,200
Great! Follow me then.

228
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
-Mr. Yogi...
-Mate!

229
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,200
Money for the lattes.

230
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,240
It's gonna be a fun night.

231
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,600
-Come.
-I'm coming.

232
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,560
Come.

233
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm in a fix.

234
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,120
There should be a helpline
on this dating website.

235
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
You think there is?

236
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,920
Go, go.

237
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
Speed. Ms. Jayashree, hurry.

238
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,320
Or we'll miss the dinner reservation.

239
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,320
-Ready, one, two, three, come!
-I'm coming.

240
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,680
Come.

241
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Follow closely... Keep driving.

242
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,560
A betel leaf?

243
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,880
So same old hangout tomorrow?
Or someplace new?

244
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,800
Would you message me
through the website?

245
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,240
We'll chat and figure it out.

246
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,920
-Let me do it right away, reply him.
-Huh?

247
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
Battery's gone.

248
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,360
Give me yours.

249
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
Give me your phone.

250
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,880
Why?

251
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,560
I'll call my driver.
How else will I get home?

252
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
Oh... sure.

253
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,400
Here.

254
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,000
Is there a problem with the touch screen?

255
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
No, it's okay.

256
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,000
Dillu, mate...

257
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,040
It's your boss.

258
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,240
Waiting with your food at the gate.
Hurry!

259
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,440
Here you go. Thank you!

260
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,520
Ms. Jayashree, do you eat mangoes?

261
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,680
-What?
-Mango, mangoes?

262
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,800
How did you get my number?

263
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,080
From Dillu.

264
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,240
This is his phone.

265
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,320
<i>-What variety of mangoes do you prefer?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

266
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,360
Some varieties, you squeeze and slurp.

267
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,160
And some others, eaten in pieces.

268
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,680
But mangoes when squeezed
and slurped, it's divine!

269
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,720
Please! I don't slurp my food.

270
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,280
Mangoes were made to slurp,
Ms. Jayashree TK.

271
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,440
<i>You've missed out on one</i>
<i>of the best things in life!</i>

272
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
This man is nuts!

273
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,240
Enjoying the jog, Dillu?

274
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,720
-Won't stop driving now, will you?
-No.

275
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,880
Will you become a rickshaw driver?

276
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
Not at all.

277
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
Won't leave me, will you?

278
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,520
Never, never.

279
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,400
This way.

280
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
-Turn right here, mate.
-Okay.

281
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
Now you can return.

282
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,720
The good life!
These are from our orchards.

283
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,400
For you, slurping practice.

284
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,720
By the way,
I've ordered two mugs of latte.

285
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,040
Time to get mugged, then.

286
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,280
And have those two apes replied?

287
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,120
I haven't checked. Why?

288
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,480
Just asking.

289
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,440
He said, "Sorry".

290
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,360
And deactivated his account.

291
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
Did you do something?

292
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
Your mug of latte.

293
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,240
-Are you one of those stalker types?
-Yes?

294
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,040
No, I'm not.

295
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,480
I can't stand people being
disrespectful to women.

296
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,640
He'll forever have nightmares
about dating sites.

297
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,200
My second girlfriend...

298
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,640
she'd say, "Viyogi...

299
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,560
there are barely a
few honorable men left.

300
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,800
Soon, they'll be banned, too."

301
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
She was right!

302
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,040
You are right. It's this face.
I look like a stalker.

303
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,840
Who's Manav?

304
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,880
How do you know?

305
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,560
You saw my password?

306
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,080
Was he your husband?

307
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,040
This is the problem with Indian women.

308
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,080
-What?
-Well...

309
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,840
Get married. Spend your whole life
with him or his memory!

310
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,800
Earlier, you'd attach them to your name.

311
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,400
Now they're stuck as your passwords.

312
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,280
-The same problem.
-Why taunt me?

313
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
You bring up your ex-girlfriends
every two seconds.

314
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,120
Who knows how many you've had!

315
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,840
Just three.

316
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,240
Been in love three times.

317
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,080
And all three... mad, crazy love.

318
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,400
Historic! Epic tragedy!

319
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,200
None of them have been able to forget me.

320
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,280
-They still pine for me.
-Are you in touch with them?

321
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,640
No. Not in touch...

322
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,760
Then how do you know they pine for you?

323
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,360
I'm sure of it.

324
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,720
Pining for years may exist in poetry,
not in real life, Mr. Yogi.

325
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,640
What would you know
about the madness of love?

326
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,200
The fortunate ones commit suicide.

327
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,160
Unfortunate ones like me write poetry.

328
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,600
The arranged marriage types...
they might move on.

329
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,880
If you're so confident, contact them.
Message them.

330
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,360
-You'll know how many tears they've shed.
-Message?

331
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,400
It was an era of love letters,
Ms. Jayashree.

332
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,920
A WhatsApp message?

333
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,040
-Then go and meet them.
-No.

334
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,480
Left three of them in pools of tears.

335
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
If they see me now,
they'll fall apart again.

336
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,600
Who are you really worried about?
Them or yourself?

337
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,000
Let's say, I go.

338
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
Would you...

339
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,320
like to come along?

340
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,760
If I go alone,
how will their families react?

341
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,200
So?

342
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,200
So come along!

343
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,560
Don't worry about the expenses.

344
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,600
I have a lot of money.
I'll take care of it.

345
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,240
You may be loaded,

346
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,360
but I take care of my own expenses.

347
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,360
What a wonderful feminist thing to say!

348
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,840
We'll split everything then.

349
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,240
I'll take care of the air tickets,
food and cabs.

350
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,640
You handle hotel bookings.

351
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,560
Of course,
we'll have to book two rooms.

352
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,160
You in yours and I'm in mine. Okay?

353
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,720
-What...
-Okay?

354
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,040
How will you introduce me to your exes?

355
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,520
We'll think of something.

356
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,920
That you are my manager.

357
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
-Manager?
-Yes.

358
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,720
A manager for your marathon practice?

359
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,120
You tell me then,
what would you like to be?

360
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,200
I don't want to play any part here.

361
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,720
Yes, Vimmi.

362
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,520
-Take your kids shopping?
-Where are you off to?

363
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,760
Listen. At least let me
say goodbye. Listen.

364
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,600
A change of scenery will do you good,
Ms. Jayashree TK.

365
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,120
City life eats you alive.

366
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,480
How long will we have lattes and dinners?

367
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,520
It'll be a vacation, too.

368
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,760
Been to Jaipur?

369
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,280
-Hrishikesh?
-Where?

370
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,120
Hrishikesh. Think about it.

371
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,080
Bye, Mr. Yogi.

372
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,200
Listen to me.

373
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,160
Gangtok?

374
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,440
Listen...

375
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,440
-Am I looking fat in this?
-No.

376
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,760
Yes.

377
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,360
I'll just try the other one.

378
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,880
-Wait here.
-Yes.

379
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,400
-Kesha wore the exact same dress!
-Like you know!

380
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,400
-Too loose?
-No...

381
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,480
-Hold it here.
-Looks good.

382
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,800
It's mom. Shall I put it on speaker?

383
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,080
Yes. Talk to her.

384
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,880
<i>How's the shopping?</i>

385
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,240
We're having fun.
The clothes are a bit pricey.

386
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,480
<i>So what?</i>
<i>Buy whatever you feel like.</i>

387
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,280
<i>Borrow from Aunt Errand.</i>

388
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,800
<i>She's my friend.</i>

389
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,960
<i>Aunt Errand is around, isn't she?</i>

390
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,920
She's right here.

391
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,240
She's right here.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

392
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,440
Come on. Let's go there.

393
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,160
Mom really knows how to embarrass us.

394
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
She knows exactly
the wrong things to say.

395
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,480
Are you done shopping?

396
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,680
<i>Ms. Jayashree, Dillu says hello.</i>

397
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,280
<i>Hello to Dillu.</i>

398
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,680
<i>Wonder if I should tell you or not...</i>

399
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,120
<i>You get offended easily.</i>

400
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,360
<i>What is it? Tell me.</i>

401
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,120
<i>Has anyone ever told you?</i>

402
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,760
<i>Your nose shoots up in</i>
<i>the air when you're angry?</i>

403
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,200
<i>Just like in cartoons.</i>

404
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,160
<i>You think of me a cartoon character?</i>

405
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,520
<i>I love cartoons.</i>
<i>They remind me of myself.</i>

406
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,720
<i>I think I could pose as a cousin.</i>

407
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
<i>Excuse me?</i>

408
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,200
<i>As your cousin. On the trip.</i>

409
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,640
<i>Do cousins pair up</i>
<i>to go on vacation together?</i>

410
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,560
Why not? Tell me if you want to...

411
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,960
Should we leave? Ice cream?

412
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,160
It's true. The <i>salwar</i> got torn.

413
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,040
-I'm going out of town for a few days.
-Oh!

414
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,400
I'll be accessible on phone and email.

415
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,880
Just get the work done.

416
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,400
-Your uncle in Gwalior?
-He called yesterday.

417
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,800
He's getting married again.

418
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,920
Wow. This uncle's quite a stud.

419
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,080
None of those genes in you?

420
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,760
The office is sending me on a trip, mom.

421
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
<i>-A trip?</i>
-Yes.

422
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,920
<i>Why?</i>

423
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Because... I'm the best employee.
It's my reward.

424
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,480
<i>That's great!</i>

425
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,640
<i>-A meditation retreat?</i>
-Yes.

426
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,760
<i>You are not allowed to talk, right?</i>

427
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes, for ten days.

428
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,680
<i>Good thing.</i>

429
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,920
<i>I'll be spared from your blabbering</i>
<i>for ten days!</i>

430
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,120
<i>Switching on the saint mode, huh?</i>

431
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,640
<i>But why, sis?</i>
<i>You're already a saint!</i>

432
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,520
Shall I back out?

433
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,560
So many days with him.

434
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,880
Chatter, chatter, chatter.
Drives me nuts!

435
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,880
Shall I cancel?

436
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,440
There you are!

437
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,360
Why are you yelling so loudly?

438
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,120
How does one yell softly?

439
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,440
Will you teach me?

440
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,320
You booked business class
for a two-hour flight?

441
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,880
We'll sit comfortably, eat good food.

442
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,480
What's the use of being rich?

443
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,040
Right?

444
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,320
If you love to throw away money,

445
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,320
you could've bought
insurance policies from me.

446
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,760
But let's take a selfie first.

447
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
Were you always a miser?

448
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,280
Let's do a pout.

449
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,280
We look so hot.

450
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,800
Ms. Jayashree,
what are you doing there?

451
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,880
Let me gift you my book.

452
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,840
Mate!

453
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,600
You have <i>The Wails of Viyogi</i>?

454
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,960
Viyogi.

455
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,960
Not "W". It's a "V" for Viyogi.

456
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,000
-Come on. I'm just joking.
-Don't side with her.

457
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,760
The book's not in stock.

458
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,360
That's unfair!

459
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,360
Madam, problems never end for women.

460
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,200
Don't you understand?

461
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,120
You can't take it aboard.
Don't you get it?

462
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
-Sir, I can't kill anyone with this.
-But you can't carry it aboard.

463
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,000
-It's not allowed.
-Not allowed?

464
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,200
-It won't scare a mouse!
-Don't you get it?

465
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,520
-Sir, please...
-What's the problem?

466
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,480
I brought my keychain along by mistake.

467
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,640
So what's the issue
if I carry a keychain?

468
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,160
-Exactly.
-No problem with this?

469
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,560
Give it to me.

470
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,640
-It's a gift from my second girlfriend.
-So?

471
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,280
It has a sentimental value.
I can't throw it.

472
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,440
It's a knife, Yogi.

473
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,120
Look at it!
I'll put it in my check-in bag

474
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
-and be right back.
-Okay?

475
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,280
Putting it in my check-in bag.
Okay?

476
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,600
I'm going.

477
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,240
Where are you?

478
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,360
Well, Ms. Jayashree.
I took ages to get to my check-in baggage.

479
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,160
-Carry on. See you at Dehradun Airport.
-What?

480
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,160
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Fasten your...</i>

481
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Has he planted something in my bag?

482
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,080
I hope not.

483
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,600
God, please!

484
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,640
All flights to Mumbai are full today.

485
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,000
There must be some option.

486
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,120
<i>I'm coming.</i>

487
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,040
<i>Till then treat yourself</i>
<i>to Uttarakhand snacks.</i>

488
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,280
Go ahead, Listina. Ask!

489
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,880
I don't know what to say.
You've called me.

490
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,320
You call me every day.
There must be some problem today, too.

491
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,120
No problems today.

492
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,200
You're asleep?

493
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,480
So early?

494
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,200
I'm in Dehradun.

495
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,360
Last time, I was here with Manav.

496
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
<i>You okay?</i>
-The meditation guys are calling me.

497
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,320
<i>If you like someone there,</i>
<i>speak to him.</i>

498
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,800
Don't talk rubbish.
Go to sleep. Bye!

499
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,760
<i>Don't be boring.</i>

500
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,159
So what did they offer you
in business class?

501
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,360
No way.

502
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,960
That's throwing away money!

503
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,800
Once I got such amazing <i>biryani</i>.
I don't have words to describe it.

504
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,280
And with it...

505
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,600
-Mate, take this burden off us.
-Yes, sir.

506
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,960
And the yogurt dip
with the <i>biryani</i>...

507
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,480
The <i>biryani</i> and the dip...

508
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,679
They were like...
like two lovers in love!

509
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,239
Ms. Jayashree.

510
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,320
Take this!

511
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,080
And... check this out.

512
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,760
Making a good yogurt dip

513
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,920
is no less than rocket science.
Trust me!

514
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,720
I still haven't told you how I met Radha.

515
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,760
We used to fly kites
before falling in love.

516
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,360
I wrote a poem on my kite

517
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,960
and it landed on her roof.

518
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
I wrote it to make a good impression.

519
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,640
We went to the same kite seller.

520
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,000
You hear me, Ms. Jayashree?

521
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,600
Radha and I shared two hobbies.

522
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,000
Food and chatting.
She made me the gourmet I am today.

523
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,880
You hear me, Ms. Jayashree?

524
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,000
Radha was in the 10th grade.
I was in the 12th grade.

525
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,040
We flew kites every day,
just so we could look at each other.

526
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,040
-Ms. Jayashree?
-Yes.

527
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,320
Some water, please? This intense
storytelling has left me parched.

528
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,400
Please don't mind, I don't
share my bottle with anyone.

529
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,720
Makes sense.

530
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,320
What if you have something
contagious and I get it?

531
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,240
Mate, please give me your bottle.

532
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,080
Take it, sir.

533
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,800
-Where's the water from?
-The Ganga.

534
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,960
The Ganga? Perfect!

535
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,560
A spiritual retreat, Ms. Jayashree!

536
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,920
Charity Home

537
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,240
So?

538
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Charity

539
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,560
Oh God!

540
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,200
What happened?

541
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,080
You could've booked us
in a three-star hotel.

542
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,480
It didn't have to be five-star.
We have enough money.

543
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,160
FYI, this place has a five-star rating
on tripbuddy.com.

544
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,480
Saints and seekers, what a pure place!

545
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,200
Since when did
they start rating <i>ashrams</i>?

546
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
Good evening, oh holy one.

547
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,400
-Bless you.
-Only you can rescue me.

548
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,920
The pots of money that you have,
where does it come from?

549
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,400
I make money just like that,
Ms. Jayashree.

550
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
Money follows me.
I don't have to work for it.

551
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,360
You earn without working?

552
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,400
I give ideas to food companies.

553
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,800
If the product works,
I enjoy the royalty.

554
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,880
Really? Tell me one.

555
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,560
One just became a huge hit.
Raw Mangifera flavored cookies.

556
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,560
Raw Mangifera.

557
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,360
-Raw Mangi?
-Raw Mangifera... Mangifera.

558
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,560
-Mangifera?
-Raw Mangifera.

559
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,240
Raw mango.

560
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,560
You and your mangoes.

561
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,520
You've not tried <i>chatori</i> cookies?

562
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,320
Once we get our deliverance from here,
I'll get you to taste it.

563
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,560
-Provided we attain it.
-Such a divine place.

564
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,400
Organic and natural food.

565
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,760
Tour the sights.
Enjoy the view of the Ganga.

566
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,000
Wake up at six and practice yoga.

567
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,480
Only roosters wake up at six for yoga!
Why should we wake up so early?

568
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,200
We're not here
to deliver milk packets.

569
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,400
Come here, mate.

570
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,000
Here you go.

571
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,200
Can you swing some wine?

572
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,880
Mate? No?

573
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,840
God will be very upset with you.

574
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,760
-Hey! How come you're here?
-Just like you.

575
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,120
-All okay?
-Yes.

576
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
The family, the kids?
Hey, listen!

577
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,360
Listen.

578
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,280
Ms. TK.

579
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,520
Practicing your yogic breathing?

580
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,880
Aren't you hungry?

581
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,240
Come for a dip in the Ganga.

582
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,520
Come on, will you?

583
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,200
One day, I was reciting my poems.

584
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,600
My father overheard me.

585
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,680
He lost his cool.

586
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
He packed me off to the city.

587
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,320
"I don't want to see you here!"

588
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,880
It was tragic!

589
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,040
I promised Radha to come back
and I left.

590
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
-These are good for the circulation.
-Oh.

591
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
How are your hemoglobin levels?

592
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,360
-Try walking in them?
-No.

593
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,320
-My hemoglobin levels are fine.
-Just a little...

594
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,920
By the time, I finished high school
and got back,

595
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,560
Radha's atrocious father
had got her engaged.

596
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,400
And he sweet-talked me into
helping with the wedding.

597
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,120
I cried my eyes out!

598
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,320
Please eat.

599
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,080
And when it was time to leave,
the way she cried...

600
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,640
She bawled her heart out!

601
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,920
Every girl cries when it's time
to leave her father's home.

602
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,240
Those tears are different.

603
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,200
These were for me.

604
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm very worried.

605
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,200
What if she breaks down again tomorrow?

606
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,040
Isn't she married?

607
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,240
How does that matter?

608
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,280
Let's say, things work out for us,

609
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,120
would you forget your husband?

610
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,160
They've started the prayers
by the Ganga.

611
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,920
Shall we go?

612
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,080
-Are you scared of ghosts?
-Huh?

613
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,120
Why?

614
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,000
We're staying in the middle of
a big cremation ground.

615
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,480
If a stray spirit shows up to say hello,
you won't be scared, right?

616
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,960
Just asking.

617
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,480
I've befriended ghosts now.

618
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,240
Are you calling me a ghost?

619
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,080
Ghosts like me aren't easy
to get rid off.

620
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,680
You need to kick us really hard,
Ms. Jayashree.

621
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,040
-Jaya.
-What?

622
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,600
Just Jaya.

623
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,880
There's no "shree".

624
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,080
Why not?

625
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,320
Jayashree was for
the <i>stillsinglle</i> profile.

626
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,480
Such a small lie!

627
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,240
That's so you.

628
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,360
The Internet's... very weird.

629
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,360
I can't tell what's true
and what's not.

630
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,360
Without the Internet,

631
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,960
the world will come
to a standstill, Mr. Yogi.

632
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,680
That's how important it is!

633
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,720
<i>The virtual world is a public record.</i>

634
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,200
Security is an issue for sure, but...

635
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,440
Lucky Radha, she got away!

636
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,080
-Ma'am, greetings!
-Greetings!

637
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,040
-I'm looking for Radha.
-Who are you?

638
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,800
Sir Poet!

639
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,080
<i>Chatori</i> cookie!

640
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,040
See what I mean!

641
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,240
Sir Poet!

642
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,880
It's been ages!

643
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,840
You haven't changed a bit.

644
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,080
The same skin and bones.

645
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,040
You lost weight.

646
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,240
He must have you in splits, right?

647
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,880
-No, I... I'm not...
-No?

648
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,600
Didn't you recognize her?
Jaya!

649
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,120
You remember Aunt Nirmala from Bareilly?

650
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Her elder daughter.

651
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,200
The one that got kicked twice
by the buffalo?

652
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,720
-The buffalo kicked...
-No, that was Aunt Usha, right?

653
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,600
Forget the aunts.

654
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,640
Tell me how you've been?

655
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,640
On top of the world, Sir Poet.

656
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,160
-On top of the world!
-Great.

657
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,200
Told you.

658
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,880
Guddu, Chandu, Krish!

659
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,240
-Who're they?
-My kids.

660
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
Wow!

661
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,480
-Come here.
-Wow!

662
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,680
Look, there's someone from my village!

663
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,400
Village?
I've come from a mega city.

664
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,000
Seek blessings from my brother.

665
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,120
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello, Uncle.

666
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
-Touch her feet too.
-Bless you!

667
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,400
-Hello, Aunt.
-No... no, please don't.

668
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,880
Guys, come on.
Get tea ready, hurry.

669
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,000
Radha, we'll leave.
We have some stuff to do.

670
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,760
Rubbish!

671
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,040
No way, you're leaving!

672
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,880
If you leave without meeting Shekhawat,
I'm dead meat.

673
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,040
-Mr. Brother-in-law!
-Dad!

674
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,000
Who's shouting?

675
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,680
-My husband, Shekhawat.
-We're upstairs.

676
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,600
-He's here.
-Your husband's here.

677
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,160
Please come.

678
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,280
-Hello.
-Brother-in-law.

679
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,440
Meet the famous poet from my village.

680
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,320
-He looks the part.
-Fantastic.

681
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,640
He does a lot of charity work there.

682
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,800
-Really?
-Yes.

683
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,520
Whenever someone comes from the village,
I'm overjoyed.

684
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,680
-Great.
-But I feel like kissing you.

685
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,000
Shall I, Radha?

686
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,640
My goodness!

687
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,360
Just great.

688
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,360
-Have a seat.
-Have a seat.

689
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,560
-Radha.
-Yes.

690
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,920
-Serve him some <i>halwa</i>.
-Okay.

691
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,760
He looks so delicate.

692
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,160
-The sign of a healthy man is curves.
-Yes?

693
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,960
There should be curves
either here... or here.

694
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
You have neither.

695
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,440
You have them, that's enough.

696
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,080
You wrestle?

697
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,080
No, no.

698
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,720
Radha likes muscular men.
That's why.

699
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,920
Okay.

700
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,080
-We have two small companies.
-Yes.

701
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,760
A travel company.

702
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,560
And the other is
Radha's Adventure Company.

703
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,160
Radha's Adventures!

704
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,600
-Radha.
-Yes!

705
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,640
Shall we take him for "that"?

706
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,680
-Yes... yes, great fun.
-What?

707
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,920
-You can eat when you return.
-What?

708
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,440
-Come, it'll be fantastic.
-Go ahead.

709
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,360
Ma'am, come along.

710
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,760
Can't this thing go any slower?

711
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,040
Park at the corner there.

712
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,040
We'll take a cab and go.

713
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,000
Park at the corner there.

714
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,400
Oh my God, Yogi!

715
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,440
-Uncle!
-Ms. Jaya.

716
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,600
-Hurry up or he'll drown.

717
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,120
-Yogi!
-Uncle.

718
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,480
You won't drown.
You have a life jacket on.

719
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,720
-What jacket?
-The one you're wearing.

720
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,760
-Come, Sir Poet.
-Don't be scared.

721
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,440
Don't be scared.

722
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,280
A hot oil massage at home
and you'll feel great.

723
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,040
No, no. We have some work.

724
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,800
We'll get off at the next turn.

725
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,800
What? Not so fast. We still
have to do "that" in the evening.

726
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,560
What's left now?

727
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,080
-I think we're done.
-What's it called, Krish?

728
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,440
-Bonfire.
-Yes, a bonfire.

729
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,120
Wow!

730
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,080
Sir Poet, please sing something.

731
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,520
-No, no.
-Please.

732
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,000
I remember how often
you'd sing your favorite song.

733
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,040
No, no.

734
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,360
You loved singing it.

735
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,400
-No, no.
-Come on, please.

736
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,760
-Come on, please.
-Come on, please.

737
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,000
Uncle, go for it.

738
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,160
Yes, yes, please.

739
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,720
Which was your favorite song?

740
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,320
<i>They're beautiful</i>

741
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,760
<i>This earth, this river</i>

742
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,200
-<i>This night</i>
-And?

743
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,200
-<i>And you!</i>
-Wow!

744
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,240
<i>We're so close</i>

745
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,800
<i>But these stars far away!</i>

746
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:48,360
<i>Like our dreams</i>
<i>We see them</i>

747
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,600
<i>But they don't exist</i>

748
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,880
<i>But these are for real</i>

749
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,760
<i>This earth, this river</i>

750
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,480
This night

751
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,640
<i>And you!</i>

752
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,280
Seems like Radha never got over you.

753
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,040
Yes, did you see
how she held my lips?

754
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,040
Yes.

755
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,920
She did it all the time.

756
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,960
But she shouldn't have called you
her brother.

757
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,840
Right?

758
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,520
In small towns, they often do that.

759
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,520
I didn't mind it.

760
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,160
I'm glad you didn't.

761
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,720
I'm glad she didn't
bawl her heart out either.

762
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,880
Right. Maybe she's crying now?

763
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
-After I left.
-You think?

764
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,240
A <i>Chatori</i> cookie to celebrate?

765
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,800
Wow! Kudos to the maker.

766
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,280
"We are different, like day and night

767
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,120
The sun rises with you,
the stars twinkle for me."

768
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,320
That's from my poem.

769
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,800
I finally found
your poem on a blog.

770
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,320
There's a blog on me on the Internet?

771
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,640
It's on the Poet Ghalib,
the blogger has quoted you.

772
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,920
Mr. Yogi, why aren't your books
on the Internet?

773
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,880
Where's the joy in reading poetry
on the net?

774
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,920
The scent of paper...
if you can't touch it...

775
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,480
Millions can access your poetry
on the net.

776
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,720
That's the benefit of the Internet.

777
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,960
Your self-published books
won't cross the oceans...

778
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,040
This should help
in spiritual growth...

779
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:54,480
<i>They're beautiful</i>

780
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,880
<i>This river</i>

781
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,400
<i>This night</i>

782
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,920
And?

783
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,240
Sing on.

784
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,160
What?

785
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,280
Please sing.

786
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,840
And?

787
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,120
My towel!

788
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,520
Get out of here!

789
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,800
I'm going.

790
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,120
-Go! Out!
-I'm leaving!

791
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,320
-Not there!
-I'm going.

792
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,040
Not here.

793
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,040
-Out of here!
-I can't see a thing!

794
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,080
Go straight now!

795
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,960
What are you saying?

796
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,280
Why did you come to my room
without knocking?

797
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,120
Close the door!

798
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,000
Mr. Yogi, how could you do this?

799
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,600
Shut the damn door!

800
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,080
-Me?
-Shut the damn door!

801
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,520
Who else?

802
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,400
-I'm closing it.
-Close your eyes, Mr. Yogi!

803
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,520
-Not that side...
-My eyes are closed!

804
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,640
My eyes are closed, I can't see.

805
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,480
I've closed it.

806
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,560
My eyes are closed!

807
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,480
-What?
-Ass!

808
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,600
Okay.

809
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,400
This had to happen today!

810
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,160
<i>Stay seated until further instructions</i>

811
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,800
<i>and do not unfasten your seat belts.</i>

812
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,280
A cool drink to
cool my cousin down?

813
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,000
Ma'am, can I get you a
raw mango drink?

814
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,800
Oh, sorry. You don't share bottles.

815
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,720
May I put this treasure chest up?

816
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,840
Sit comfortably.
No one's running away with it.

817
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,280
Will you please calm down now?

818
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,240
I didn't know you sang so well.

819
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,840
While listening...

820
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
I leaned on the door
and the damn door just gave away.

821
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,080
I don't know who left the door open.

822
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,320
But who opened the door?

823
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,600
I could've had a heart attack.
Think about it.

824
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,600
It was scary.

825
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,120
Must be a ghost.

826
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,520
There were ghosts
where you booked us, I'm sure!

827
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,920
That motel.

828
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,560
Was it a motel?

829
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,880
No, it was a spiritual retreat.

830
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,640
There's a surprise for you in Delhi.

831
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,440
"Really? What surprise?"

832
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,520
If I told you, it wouldn't remain
a surprise, would it?

833
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,880
Did I ask you what the surprise was?

834
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,800
No, you didn't.

835
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,080
But, it's so fabulous
that you'll be super happy.

836
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,360
You'll enjoy it so...

837
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,440
<i>Time to sleep</i>

838
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,080
<i>Please pay attention.</i>

839
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,640
It's an 1855 steam engine,
did you know that?

840
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,520
It's in the Guinness
Book of World Records!

841
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,240
Really?

842
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,920
Go ahead, Google it.

843
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,360
Why Google when you're here?

844
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,840
-Step in.
-Here?

845
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,960
I got it, thanks.

846
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,480
Wow.

847
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,560
This train was in the museum for years.

848
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,880
Then it thought,
why not tour the tracks?

849
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,680
Hang out with the exes.

850
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,800
I love the way you laugh.

851
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,320
-There.
-Thank you.

852
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,720
Can I take that? Have a seat.

853
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,280
The train's making you so happy,
shall we buy it?

854
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,960
-Perhaps, buy something to eat?
-Great!

855
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,480
I thought you'd never ask.

856
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,000
-I'll get you something awesome.
-Okay.

857
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,560
Sir, we have a set menu.

858
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,800
That's not cool, mate.

859
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,560
Cold cucumber sandwiches
with hot tea?

860
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,840
That's not done.

861
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,920
Get some hot fritters going, mate.

862
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,880
It's a set menu.

863
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,040
Not everything is set in life.

864
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,720
There's the answer!

865
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,720
Give me some of those, mate.

866
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,240
-Are these freshly made?
-Absolutely, sir.

867
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,160
A plate of those.

868
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,720
-One plate.
-No, make it two.

869
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,160
What's that?

870
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,200
Kebabs!

871
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,160
I could hug you, mate.
I'm tired of veggies!

872
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,440
-Pack some kebabs, too?
-Don't even think about it!

873
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,200
It's the whistle! Time to leave.

874
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,720
Hurry up, mate.
Some of those, too.

875
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,840
Here.

876
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,760
-How much?
-75 rupees.

877
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,640
Here.
And for the kebabs, too.

878
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,520
-But, you didn't buy any, sir.
-Keep it, mate.

879
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,360
Excuse me, please...

880
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,960
Excuse me, please...

881
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,400
Oh damn! Don't change the subject.

882
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,800
It's our turn now.

883
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,400
That's right.

884
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,160
Is the Fairy Queen
luxury section ahead?

885
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,120
It's gone. There she goes.

886
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,880
-Oh God!
-Pull the emergency chain.

887
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,520
Go ahead.

888
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,000
Broke it?

889
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,160
-Hello.
-Are you on the train?

890
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,440
Yes. But, not on ours. On another one.

891
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,960
-Yogi! Pull the chain.
-I did. It broke.

892
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,640
The Indian Railways for you!

893
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,960
<i>Yogi.</i>

894
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,120
-Jump, Yogi. Jump.
-Okay, I'll jump.

895
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,160
-Ms. Jaya, should I jump?
-Yes, jump.

896
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,200
-Jump off?
-Obviously.

897
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,720
Alright.

898
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,960
I can't.
The train's moving, Ms. Jaya.

899
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,240
It's slow, Yogi.

900
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,760
Maybe your train is slow. Mine's not!

901
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,680
What if I break my leg?

902
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,560
Get off quickly, ass!

903
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,640
What's that?

904
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,000
Why did you get off?

905
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,800
I went to get us fritters, Ms. Jaya.

906
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,360
-Hello!
-The height of foolishness, Yogi!

907
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,960
We are in trouble!

908
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,960
Sorry, Ms. Jaya.

909
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,320
Come on! 15 fritters for 10 rupees.

910
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,120
Have some delicious fritters.

911
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,480
A gentleman had ordered fritters.

912
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,960
Leave it here.

913
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,160
Yes, ma'am.

914
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,160
It's not chess. Don't take so long.
Go ahead, play.

915
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,760
It's your turn now.

916
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,800
Ms. Jaya, everything's sorted.

917
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,040
Is my laptop bag with you?

918
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,000
Yes. What about it?

919
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,440
Please keep it carefully.

920
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,560
Don't worry.
It's kept close to my heart.

921
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,360
Have you gotten off the train?

922
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,680
No. Old Delhi is 15 minutes away.

923
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,880
I'll get off and figure out transport.

924
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,440
I'll get there when you will.

925
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,560
Buddy, stop looking at my cards.

926
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,400
Can't you figure it out now?

927
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,680
There's an Internet dongle
in my laptop bag.

928
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,400
Net? Okay.

929
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,520
Is the password
the same or changed?

930
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,480
What?

931
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,840
-Your turn.
-Your turn.

932
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,000
-Buddy, it's your turn.
-Here you go.

933
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,200
<i>Thief!</i>

934
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,320
Is it stolen?

935
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,840
No, it's with me.

936
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,120
<i>Where is it?</i>

937
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,120
Ashish, your voice is breaking up.

938
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,240
<i>What's wrong?</i>

939
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,960
Top class idiot!

940
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:23,280
<i>How I wish I could kill you!</i>

941
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,920
<i>How I wish I could kill you!</i>

942
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,280
I'm done. It's your turn.

943
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,000
<i>Take my life, will you?</i>

944
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,560
<i>And I'll take yours</i>

945
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,560
<i>Take my life, will you?</i>

946
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,440
<i>And I'll take yours.</i>
<i>Gently, I'll squeeze your neck</i>

947
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,120
Tell him I've jumped off the train.

948
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,400
Tell him!

949
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,920
The train to Alwar is tomorrow morning.

950
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,120
-Tomorrow?
-Yes, sir.

951
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,640
-Hurry! To Alwar.
-Where will you go, sir?

952
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,040
So far? In a rickshaw?

953
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,640
Will you go to Alwar?

954
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,200
Of course! Wherever you say, sire.

955
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,800
-You'll have to step on the gas.
-Absolutely.

956
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,960
-Like an airplane.
-I'll fly like a rocket, sire.

957
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,920
I'm from Old Delhi.

958
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,240
We have a saying,
"Hands off the wheel,

959
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,000
but feet never off the pedal."

960
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,840
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

961
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,040
<i>Are you stupid?</i>

962
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,840
<i>I ask for a squirrel</i>
<i>You come with a buffalo</i>

963
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,400
<i>Which school has churned you out?</i>

964
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,680
<i>Just one way out of this</i>

965
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
<i>Kick you out, goodbye!</i>

966
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,920
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

967
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,560
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

968
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,320
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

969
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,080
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

970
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,840
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

971
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,720
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

972
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,120
<i>Just one way out of this</i>

973
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,480
-<i>Kick you out, goodbye!</i>
-Sir!

974
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,280
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

975
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,080
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

976
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,840
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

977
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,040
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

978
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,320
Ma'am, I understand you
won't go for the wildlife safari?

979
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,040
It's part of the
Fairy Queen package.

980
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,400
It's already been paid for.

981
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,280
-S'il vous plait!
-Merci!

982
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,400
If it's paid for, I'm going.

983
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,680
Of course, I'll go.

984
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,240
Please tell my cousin...

985
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,360
<i>All lines in this route are busy.</i>

986
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,360
<i>Should I shed tears?</i>

987
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,160
<i>Should I shed tears for you?</i>

988
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,840
<i>Or laugh at you?</i>

989
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,360
<i>How do I get you to understand?</i>

990
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,840
<i>You're an illiterate fool</i>

991
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,000
<i>Did you knock yourself out?</i>

992
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,560
<i>Oh looney lady</i>
<i>Spare me this nightmare!</i>

993
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,000
<i>Oh looney lady</i>
<i>Spare me this nightmare!</i>

994
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,080
<i>I might be the one to squeeze your neck!</i>

995
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,840
<i>Take my life, will you?</i>

996
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,640
<i>And I'll take yours</i>

997
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,080
<i>Why bother this much?</i>

998
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,320
<i>Let's just say goodbye!</i>

999
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,080
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

1000
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,840
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

1001
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,600
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

1002
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,320
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

1003
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,080
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

1004
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,840
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

1005
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,560
<i>Neither are you king nor am I queen</i>

1006
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,720
<i>This is no fairy tale</i>

1007
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,640
<i>Take my life, will you?</i>

1008
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,920
<i>And I'll take yours</i>

1009
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
<i>Take my life, will you?</i>

1010
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,680
Should I slow down, sire?

1011
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,120
Don't you slow down!

1012
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,120
<i>Take my life, will you?</i>

1013
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,359
Where's she gone?

1014
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,319
The wildlife safari.

1015
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:30,680
Must be on her way back.

1016
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,680
Okay.

1017
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,880
And why are you waiting alone?

1018
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,160
Come along.

1019
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,439
Come on.

1020
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:17,279
Greetings!

1021
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,479
Good night!

1022
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,120
When did you get here?

1023
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:36,760
Eight hours too late.

1024
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,200
It's been eight hours?

1025
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:47,680
Any wild animals on the safari?

1026
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,359
Antelope? Jackal?

1027
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,160
-Wow!
-It was amazing.

1028
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,840
So what's your plan?

1029
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,080
Shall we move on?

1030
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,200
I was thinking of returning to Mumbai.

1031
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,040
There's a ton of work piling up.

1032
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,040
Babysitting kids...

1033
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,920
or taking someone shopping?

1034
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,640
We should meet other people.

1035
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,800
-Go out...
-Go out on dates with others?

1036
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,320
Right.

1037
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,160
Should I find you a dashing prince
on the same site?

1038
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,840
You still on it?

1039
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,120
Why? Shouldn't I be?

1040
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,680
But I've heard there are rules
to online dating.

1041
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,720
Are there? What might they be?

1042
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:51,080
Well, if you're getting to know someone,

1043
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,240
you're supposed to
deactivate your account.

1044
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,920
But didn't you just mention
dating other people?

1045
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,600
It doesn't make a difference to me.

1046
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,040
-There's one difference between us.
-Just one?

1047
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,960
There are many small ones,
but this is important.

1048
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,520
What is it?

1049
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,280
Let it be.

1050
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,840
No, please tell me. What is it?

1051
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,400
I speak my mind.
I do what my heart desires.

1052
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,640
But you...

1053
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,520
Sire, when will your cousin be here?

1054
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,840
Mate, no one in the world
has the answer to that.

1055
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,720
Let's wait some more.

1056
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,280
As He wishes.

1057
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,840
-In this cab.
-Sir!

1058
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,640
So what did they feed you
on the Fairy Queen?

1059
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,680
-Fritters.
-That rascal got you fritters?!

1060
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,480
The wounds remained a lifetime,

1061
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,240
and I was distraught with time.

1062
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,040
Distraught with time?

1063
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,560
Why did my fingers freeze
as they wrote your name.

1064
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,480
Fantastic, sire!

1065
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,560
As the performance was over,

1066
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,640
a gorgeous woman wearing
stilettos and a long <i>kurta</i>,

1067
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,840
walked up to me and softly said...

1068
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,840
"Why do you write such sad poetry?"

1069
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,840
And what did you say, sire?

1070
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,720
"Because I hadn't found you yet."

1071
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,960
Oh, man! You just killed it, sire.
Too much!

1072
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,400
How can I forget such a romance, mate?

1073
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,160
I'll be meeting her after 14 years.

1074
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,400
Never!

1075
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,920
-That kind of love is once in a lifetime.
-Well...

1076
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,440
I got lucky twice over.
And then, a third time.

1077
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,240
Barely love,
almost like the local train.

1078
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,480
Miss one, hop on to the other!

1079
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,840
Ma'am, you have to
fall in love to know

1080
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,280
what it feels like.
How would you know?

1081
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,800
-Those who've had an arranged marriage...
-Stop the car.

1082
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,480
-Why get upset over trivial issues?
-Stop the car!

1083
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,520
Where are you going?

1084
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,120
Drugstore
Reasonable prices

1085
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,640
This isn't the brand I asked for.

1086
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,560
It's fantastic, madam. It's new.

1087
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,040
I pop four-five myself every night.

1088
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,800
The best sleep ever!

1089
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,040
Never heard of it.

1090
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,080
You take sleeping pills, Ms. Jaya?

1091
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,520
Good Lord!

1092
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,080
The worst habit ever!

1093
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,000
Your other habits like not
sharing water are still okay...

1094
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,760
Meditate. Stare at the fan.
Count backward...

1095
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,200
We have to attend a party at Anjali's.

1096
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,160
Anything else?

1097
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,120
Thank you.

1098
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,560
That's 87 rupees and 95 paisa, sir.

1099
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,440
95 paisa!
I want exact change back.

1100
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,120
-I want exact change back.
-Five...

1101
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,040
You bought the Fairy Queen...

1102
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,520
I'll just go to the pantry.

1103
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,440
Oh shit!

1104
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,960
You're going to get us killed.

1105
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,920
I've locked all the doors, sire.

1106
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,160
Check it again.

1107
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,640
Checked, sire.

1108
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,320
What pills are these!

1109
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,400
Ms. Jaya, please sleep for a bit.

1110
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,960
-Here's a pillow.
-Everything will be fine.

1111
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,840
Don't be silly.
She doesn't share anything with others.

1112
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,760
There's something
I'd like to ask you...

1113
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,760
Why did you stop after the third one?

1114
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,480
Why not a fourth or a fifth?

1115
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,880
Manav's asking.

1116
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,840
Is Mr. Manav sitting
in the back with you?

1117
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,560
No.

1118
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,440
Right there in front of me.

1119
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,560
How can you talk to Mr. Manav?

1120
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,000
Do you have a special data plan?

1121
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,720
An exclusive one!

1122
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,000
A direct line.

1123
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,000
Hey...

1124
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,200
Didn't you go to Old Delhi
to fry fritters?

1125
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,240
-Where are they?
-The fritters?

1126
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,280
They're being fried.

1127
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,760
-Are they?
-Yes, they are.

1128
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,080
-Are they?
-Yes, they are.

1129
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,240
Still being fried?

1130
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,520
You can't eat them till you fry them.

1131
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,840
Why is everything so slow
on the Fairy Queen?

1132
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,200
I'm hungry.

1133
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,440
Give me the fritters.

1134
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,520
They'll be ready soon.

1135
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,760
Mate, how long before we reach there?

1136
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,240
We're almost there, sire.

1137
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,280
Hurry up, mate.

1138
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,400
-Mr. and Mrs.?
-Miss...

1139
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,520
Shashidharan.

1140
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,920
-Shashi...
-Shashidharan.

1141
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,200
Two separate rooms, please.

1142
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,680
We're having a fight.

1143
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,880
Oh!

1144
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,480
-Which couple doesn't, Mr. Shashidharan?
-Yes.

1145
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,160
-I'll give you adjacent rooms.
-Yes.

1146
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,000
There will be hope for a truce.

1147
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,680
Here?

1148
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,240
Where is it?

1149
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,080
<i>It's the limit! Taking revenge?</i>

1150
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,040
-No.
-<i>I never made you wait so much.</i>

1151
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,480
Your memory fails you.

1152
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,120
Even owls would go back to sleep
and I'd be up waiting.

1153
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,240
-<i>It is revenge then!</i>
-No.

1154
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,120
Let's meet tomorrow.

1155
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,800
-We're still on our way...
-<i>No, absolutely not!</i>

1156
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,680
-We're in your city, Ms. Number Two.
-Hey...

1157
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,640
-Where should we come?
-Hey...

1158
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,520
Please ignore that.

1159
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,080
The party must have been over by now.

1160
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,520
-We'll meet tomorrow?
-<i>No way!</i>

1161
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,640
<i>What's happening there?</i>

1162
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,800
-A procession's passing by.
-What?

1163
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,080
We must meet today!

1164
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,320
Shall I make it one room, then?

1165
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,600
One room?

1166
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,040
No. We want two.

1167
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,560
My regards!

1168
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,720
-Anjali.
-Viyogi!

1169
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,480
God.

1170
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,800
-Hats off to you, Sir Poet.
-Mr. Shashidharan...

1171
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,600
She's real poetry!

1172
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,080
Mr. Shashidharan.

1173
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,600
Shall I get you the suite?

1174
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,360
What room?

1175
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,720
The suite.

1176
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,080
Unbelievable!

1177
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,440
Anjali's turned into Angelina Jolie.

1178
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,960
Where are your long <i>kurtas</i>?

1179
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,320
Somewhere in the back of the closet.

1180
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,640
One word from you and I'll pull it out.

1181
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,400
Don't take the effort.

1182
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,840
They're kept well?

1183
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,960
Absolutely.
One is especially safe.

1184
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,760
The maroon one?

1185
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,160
That's the one.

1186
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,360
Maroon!

1187
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,320
Viyogi, you haven't changed at all.

1188
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,480
You're just the same. Vagabond.

1189
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,000
I'm glad, you didn't get too rich.

1190
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,080
Money ruins the best of them.

1191
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,320
Tell her that you are rich.

1192
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,960
-What?
-Tell her...

1193
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,800
Yes... I'll tell her.

1194
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,520
-Did you leave the party midway?
-What?

1195
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,440
Same old party. Same old people.
Same old conversations.

1196
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,280
And you've come from
so far just to meet me.

1197
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,960
Anjali, you're sizzling hot!

1198
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,880
So much steam!

1199
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,120
Too many sleeping pills.

1200
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,120
Without you...

1201
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,400
If I may recite, with your permission?

1202
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,360
-Please do.
-Do I...

1203
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,800
-Please, please do.
-I see.

1204
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,080
-Please, please do.
-Shall I?

1205
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,280
Please.

1206
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,080
Where you don't exist...

1207
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,400
there exist just ruins.

1208
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,760
Cause wherever you stand...

1209
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,520
that's where the party begins!

1210
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,600
How was that?

1211
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,400
-Wonderful!
-Wonderful!

1212
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,520
-Did you say she's your cousin?
-Yes.

1213
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,040
His Aunt Nirmala's daughter.

1214
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,600
Wasn't she got kicked by a buffalo?

1215
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,640
Mom, I tell you. A nut case!

1216
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,680
You...

1217
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,680
Wasn't that her penknife?

1218
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,480
-Where is it?
-What?

1219
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,560
-In this pocket...
-Jaya, what are you doing?

1220
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,320
-Jaya, what are you doing?
-Where is it?

1221
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,800
Where is it?

1222
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,480
Jaya, what are you doing?

1223
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,960
-You put it here.
-What are you...

1224
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,240
-Got it!
-What do you want?

1225
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,600
-No, don't...
-Here!

1226
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,800
-No, don't.
-Look at this.

1227
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,520
This blade still cuts apart
the beats of his heart.

1228
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,080
Wow. Now give it back.

1229
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,920
Viyogi, you still have it?

1230
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,840
Well...

1231
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,160
He believes...

1232
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,320
you still miss him.

1233
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,720
No, I mean...

1234
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,400
Tell her you're rich.

1235
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,200
I will, I will.

1236
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,560
-I will.
-Tell her right now.

1237
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,040
I will.

1238
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,560
-Now!
-Okay.

1239
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,720
She's a bit woozy.
Too many sleeping pills.

1240
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,880
Are you done?

1241
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,640
-Yes.
-Are you done?

1242
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,600
Yes.

1243
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,800
I'll walk her to the door.

1244
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,880
-Okay.
-Please wait in the car.

1245
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,720
Ma'am, this way.

1246
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,880
Awfully quiet for a party.

1247
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,080
-Is it over?
-No.

1248
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,080
The last few would be on the terrace.

1249
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,320
They'll do some stargazing all night.

1250
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,640
And sing the same old songs.

1251
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,200
So you think I didn't get over you?

1252
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,080
What was the party for?

1253
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,880
My wedding anniversary.

1254
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,440
And you came to meet me?

1255
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,640
I just left the anniversary party,

1256
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,880
not the marriage.

1257
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,280
-I never forgot what you said.
-What?

1258
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,040
"You are leaving a poet...

1259
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,720
but his poetry
will always stay with you."

1260
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,680
You chose well.

1261
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,200
My poetry doesn't buy me a bag of chips!

1262
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,520
Ma'am, where are you...

1263
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,760
-You still have the scooter?
-No, sold it.

1264
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,520
But I kept its mirror.

1265
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,560
So is she packing her bags?

1266
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,680
Are you going to steal her away?

1267
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,440
-Steal her?
-Yes!

1268
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,160
It's very late now, Ms. Jaya.

1269
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,120
I'll come back for her in the morning.

1270
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,200
What?

1271
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,120
Why did you need to hide?

1272
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,520
Isn't she the love of your life?

1273
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,040
-Isn't she?
-What?

1274
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:29,320
We would have closed our eyes.
You could've had fun in the car.

1275
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,760
You had to cover your ears too.

1276
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,680
-Did you kiss her?
-No.

1277
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,240
No, I didn't.

1278
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,760
She kissed me.

1279
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,760
Just once.

1280
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,760
What now?

1281
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,320
What? It's done now.

1282
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,040
An affair with a married woman,
Mr. Viyogi?

1283
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,000
Your second ex becomes
your fourth girlfriend?

1284
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,920
Why are you stuck on the numbers?

1285
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,880
Let it be.

1286
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,680
The driver is waiting.
There's no one else to take us back.

1287
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,840
This city's a maze. We'll get stuck.

1288
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,160
Asleep, Ms. Jaya?

1289
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,640
-You were...
-Yes!

1290
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,200
You were absolutely right!

1291
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,600
-Mr. Yoginder AKA whatever...
-What did you say?

1292
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,680
I don't give a damn
about your pseudonym!

1293
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,880
-There's one difference between us.
-Yogi is my pseudonym.

1294
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
What difference?

1295
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,520
-Lots of small differences...
-Yes?

1296
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,920
-...but there's a major difference.
-A Major difference.

1297
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,880
I don't cheat on anyone.

1298
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,000
You're absolutely right!

1299
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,400
Slimeball!

1300
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,880
Oh my...

1301
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,760
Go to the love of your life.

1302
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,120
I have Manav.

1303
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,280
But he's not around.

1304
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,680
He passed away many years ago.

1305
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,000
Come along.

1306
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,560
What happened?

1307
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,120
Ms. Jaya.

1308
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,760
Where are you?

1309
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,080
-Oh God.
-You are dead!

1310
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,960
Jaya...

1311
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,800
Asleep?

1312
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,320
Yogi.

1313
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,600
Mr. Yogi.

1314
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,000
What are you doing in my room?

1315
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,040
What are you doing in my room?

1316
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:49,040
Well... the thing is...

1317
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,360
you're in my room.

1318
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,120
What are you doing here?

1319
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,440
Yeah... so, why did you bring me here?

1320
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,680
What do you think?

1321
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,120
It's your room. What do you think?

1322
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,520
You brought me to this room.

1323
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,800
Forcibly!

1324
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,880
-Forced you?
-Yes.

1325
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,360
Are you saying
that in my drunken state,

1326
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,520
I forced you?

1327
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,040
That's what happened.

1328
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,120
You don't know what you're capable of.

1329
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,560
Whatever happened, it was meant to be.
What do we do now?

1330
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,760
Did you?

1331
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,480
Touch my arm.

1332
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,760
-Doesn't it feel different from before?
-Why?

1333
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,160
I carried you all the way,
so I've developed muscles here.

1334
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,600
I carried you.
Didn't steal you away.

1335
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,640
You have muscles now?

1336
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,600
-Ms. Jaya.
-Yes!

1337
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,320
You had passed out
under the moon and stars,

1338
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,920
on a carpet of green grass.

1339
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,440
Wasn't it a full moon night?

1340
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,800
Ms. Jaya.

1341
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,120
Mr. Yogi.

1342
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,040
I still see a full moon.

1343
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,920
Answer the call.

1344
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,080
Why aren't you answering it?

1345
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,960
-What?
-Answer the phone.

1346
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,080
And shall I leave?

1347
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,560
-If you want some privacy.
-What?

1348
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,440
No. What's the hurry?

1349
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,320
I'll answer it.
What's the rush?

1350
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,640
Perhaps she wants more?

1351
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,920
What do you think?

1352
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,520
A question for a question?

1353
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,840
Tell me, what do I think?

1354
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,680
What do I think?
What do you think?

1355
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,800
What does she think?

1356
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,960
Who knows?

1357
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,880
You tell me what you think.

1358
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,520
Take the call.

1359
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,240
<i>What the hell!</i>
<i>I've been calling for so long.</i>

1360
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,280
<i>Why don't you answer the call?</i>

1361
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:41,520
Give it a rest, Anjali.
Let me sleep a bit.

1362
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,840
<i>It's an old habit.</i>
<i>It won't go away so easily.</i>

1363
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,480
<i>Your scent took me back in time.</i>

1364
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,800
<i>By the way...</i>

1365
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,960
<i>I pulled out that maroon kurta</i>
<i>from the closet.</i>

1366
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,960
<i>Will you come over to see it?</i>

1367
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,320
Huh?

1368
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,680
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>Cat got your tongue?</i>

1369
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,640
<i>Mr. Viyogi.</i>
<i>Forgotten the art of repartee?</i>

1370
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,120
<i>You remember?</i>

1371
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,280
<i>I used to be Aunt Nirmala's daughter</i>
<i>once upon a time.</i>

1372
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,240
<i>Listen. She's a keeper!</i>

1373
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,760
<i>Keep her close.</i>

1374
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,080
-Sire.
-Sire.

1375
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,240
Sire, I tried writing last night.

1376
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,720
Not sure if it's a poem or a song.

1377
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,840
Very well.

1378
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,120
Sire!

1379
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,520
-Sire!
-Right back at you!

1380
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:16,480
The way the light's falling
on your face...

1381
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,960
it's as if an artist...
has painted it.

1382
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,920
Liquid gold dripping off your nose.

1383
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:35,200
Like your third ex...
my ex-boyfriend lives in Gangtok, too.

1384
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,160
And I've come on this trip to meet him.

1385
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,760
Not to meet your exes.

1386
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,520
You had a boyfriend?

1387
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,280
Yes.

1388
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:52,480
You mean an authentic,
legitimate boyfriend?

1389
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,920
What do you mean authentic?

1390
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,880
I mean a proper boyfriend?

1391
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,760
Obviously, authentic!

1392
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,480
Is there another kind?

1393
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,560
Were you in kindergarten then?

1394
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,120
In college!

1395
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,920
Don't think I can have a boyfriend?

1396
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,120
Of course, you can.
Could've been many.

1397
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,840
You're saintly enough
to have stopped at one.

1398
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,720
Sikkim's most famous face.

1399
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,000
Google it. Sidkong Sharma.

1400
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,880
Ding-Dong Sharma?
Never heard of him before.

1401
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,480
He was a guest faculty at our college.

1402
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,120
Who did you say you were coming with?

1403
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,480
How did you plan to introduce me?

1404
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,000
Why?

1405
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,640
Have you lied to him like you lied to me?

1406
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,280
-But you...
-Sire, to the airport, right?

1407
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,160
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Thank you.

1408
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,360
Oh, we didn't hear your poem.

1409
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,960
-Another time, sire.
-Okay. Goodbye!

1410
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:30,160
-Sire, something I wanted to tell you.
-Yes?

1411
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,440
It's the first rule of driving.

1412
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,640
Eyes on the road, always!

1413
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,400
Straight ahead.

1414
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,960
Of course the rear view is important.

1415
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,000
But to turnaround and
go back a 100 kilometers

1416
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,400
is a waste of time.

1417
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,200
But you know best. You are wise.

1418
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,120
You've spoken such wise words!

1419
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,240
You were a great guide.

1420
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,800
So long.

1421
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,200
Jaya!

1422
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,320
You must've come for a conference,
I'm sure.

1423
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,360
-Such a coincidence.
-Hello!

1424
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,200
My friend from the salon.

1425
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,400
She has great taste in clothes.

1426
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,360
Really?

1427
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:22,240
We have a hen party. Next weekend.

1428
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,960
And you must design our kaftans.

1429
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,240
An off-shoulder for me, please.

1430
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,200
She'll do it.
Our problem is solved, isn't it?

1431
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:32,160
Now, Jaya will style us.

1432
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,560
She had a yellow kaftan.

1433
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,560
So beautiful, I almost died.

1434
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:40,200
Mrs. Saluja, I haven't
come here for a conference.

1435
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,480
I'm traveling with a date.

1436
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,760
Yes. But,
it didn't click with this date.

1437
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,360
So, I'm off to Sikkim...

1438
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,320
to meet an ex-boyfriend.

1439
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,200
She's rocking it.

1440
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,200
Really!

1441
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,800
She's coming to meet me.

1442
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,040
Of course.
Why else would I come to Gangtok?

1443
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:23,760
My cousin is with me.

1444
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,160
Yes.

1445
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,000
<i>A helicopter ride...</i>

1446
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,480
When you're done with your fingers,
you can borrow mine.

1447
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,200
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

1448
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,920
Ours isn't a till-death-
do-us-apart love story.

1449
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,760
I've booked my return ticket.

1450
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,880
I'll leave for the airport
after meeting my ex.

1451
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,240
Enjoy the mountains with Mr. Sharma.

1452
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,600
If you feel like it,
call me when you get back.

1453
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,920
We can give a coffee
shop some business.

1454
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,840
But...

1455
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,520
Go on.

1456
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:54,880
Here.

1457
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,240
What does Ms. Number Three do?

1458
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,600
Well...

1459
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,240
Gauri teaches contemporary dance.

1460
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,320
Is Mr. Sharma coming here to meet you?

1461
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,240
To pick me up.

1462
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:23,840
He'll take me home.

1463
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,160
To introduce you to the family.

1464
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,480
He's single, too.

1465
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:33,200
Is he properly single
or single like you and me?

1466
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,920
I'll go.

1467
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,240
When it was about your exes, Yogi...

1468
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,240
you took me on a world tour.

1469
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,600
You've booked your return ticket?

1470
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,920
Your food, your exes.

1471
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,160
Your poetry.

1472
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,680
Your keychain.

1473
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,120
It's all about you!

1474
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,840
Your fritters, your <i>chatori</i> cookies,

1475
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,400
your snores!

1476
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,280
Your damn snores!

1477
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,600
And the nonstop jabbering!

1478
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,080
I don't want to give some business
to a coffee shop with you.

1479
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,720
Because there's no room for anyone else
in your life.

1480
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:48,640
Does yours have room for someone else?

1481
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,680
You're looking stunning!

1482
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,080
Vimmi.

1483
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,680
-You gave me the perfect name.
<i>-What?</i>

1484
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,680
Aunt Errand.

1485
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:38,160
Next time,
call when you need a friend. Okay?

1486
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,400
<i>Please listen to me.</i>

1487
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,720
Komal, your cat spends
more time with me than you do.

1488
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,160
I'm in Sikkim on a pleasure trip.

1489
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,480
Please don't call me.

1490
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,680
If you meet someone through
a dating website...

1491
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,400
Still nursing hopes of marrying me?

1492
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,280
It's been 14 years.

1493
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:28,400
<i>There was a dream</i>

1494
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,800
<i>Should we let it go?</i>

1495
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:35,840
<i>The little that we have</i>

1496
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:39,720
<i>Shall we let it go?</i>

1497
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:43,640
<i>There was a dream</i>

1498
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:47,040
<i>Should we let it go?</i>

1499
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:51,120
<i>The little that we have</i>

1500
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,680
<i>Shall we let it go?</i>

1501
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:59,200
<i>Shall we take a moment, look within</i>

1502
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,240
<i>Or perhaps, let it go</i>

1503
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:06,800
<i>Out of habit, you'd wonder</i>
<i>If it worked out, how'd it be?</i>

1504
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,840
<i>But no, let it go</i>

1505
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:14,040
<i>There was a dream</i>

1506
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,400
<i>Should we let it go?</i>

1507
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:21,520
<i>The little that we have</i>

1508
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:25,520
<i>Shall we let it go?</i>

1509
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,600
<i>The past, why doesn't it ever pass?</i>

1510
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:06,800
<i>Oh, why not?</i>

1511
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:13,720
<i>It finds its way back into the present</i>

1512
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:21,960
<i>I didn't think about you</i>

1513
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:28,720
<i>Yet, your memory found its way</i>
<i>Back into my heart</i>

1514
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:34,520
<i>If you'd have questions for me</i>
<i>I'd have plenty of answers</i>

1515
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,560
<i>But no, let it go</i>

1516
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,920
<i>Out of habit, you'd wonder</i>
<i>If it worked out, how'd it be?</i>

1517
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,240
<i>But no, let it go</i>

1518
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,280
You made it big, congratulations.

1519
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,720
<i>That which was a dream</i>

1520
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:52,440
<i>Should we let it go?</i>

1521
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,560
<i>The little that we have</i>

1522
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,880
<i>Shall we let it go?</i>

1523
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:22,680
In the words of a saint

1524
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,560
How can I help you?

1525
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:48,120
<i>Where's my sister?</i>

1526
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,280
She's gone out.

1527
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,000
<i>Who are you?</i>

1528
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,200
Yogi.

1529
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,040
<i>What's the full name?</i>

1530
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:56,360
<i>What name do you</i>
<i>go by on Facebook?</i>

1531
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,400
<i>And how do you know my sister?</i>

1532
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,440
<i>Met her at that</i>
<i>godforsaken retreat?</i>

1533
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,440
Mate, let's not go down that road.

1534
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,960
My name is Yogendra Kumar
Devendranath Prajapati AKA Viyogi.

1535
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,640
I did have a Facebook profile
but I've deleted it.

1536
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,800
I'm not interested
in the other sites.

1537
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:14,000
And I'm not sure where I stand.

1538
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:16,240
You study at an
Ivy league University.

1539
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,160
Ms. Jaya Shashidharan's brother...

1540
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:20,720
haven't you figured out
that I'm no thief!

1541
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:27,040
<i>Are you her... boyfriend?</i>

1542
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,440
The famous local industrialist,
Mr. Kong Sharma,

1543
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,040
where does he live?

1544
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,200
Yogi!

1545
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:55,880
Yogi.

1546
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,560
I miss the damn ride every time.

1547
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,520
Not this time!

1548
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,000
Mr. Yogi.

1549
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:35,960
Yes, Ms. Jaya.

1550
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,880
May I ask you something?

1551
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:55,960
Yes.

1552
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,480
Are you sure?

1553
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,560
Yes, I am.

1554
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,480
Will you share this with me?

1555
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:26,240
<i>Soaring in the skies like a bird I glide</i>

1556
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:30,120
<i>Following your lead, wherever you go</i>

1557
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,440
<i>As your fellow traveler</i>

1558
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:38,240
<i>I'll walk hand in hand with you</i>

1559
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,520
<i>Soaring in the skies like a bird I glide</i>

1560
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:54,080
<i>Following your lead, wherever you go</i>

1561
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:59,800
<i>Make an excuse, call me out</i>
<i>I'll be there for you</i>

1562
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,400
<i>Following your lead, wherever you go</i>

1563
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:06,800
<i>We'll flow together</i>

1564
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:10,720
<i>We'll find shore, here somewhere</i>

1565
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:15,040
<i>Let's get close, take this forward</i>

1566
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:19,400
<i>Let's find out what happens next</i>

1567
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:25,800
<i>Just walk with me</i>
<i>I'll follow your lead blindly</i>

1568
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:30,360
<i>Just walk with me</i>

1569
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:35,120
<i>Let's take a step</i>

1570
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:39,520
<i>Just walk with me</i>

1571
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:43,680
<i>Only dreams will be waiting for us</i>

1572
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:50,160
<i>Just walk with me</i>
<i>We'll find reasons on our way</i>

1573
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,920
<i>Where do you wanna go?</i>
<i>What's the worry?</i>

1574
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,200
<i>We'll think about destination</i>
<i>On our way</i>

1575
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:18,520
<i>Destination is an excuse</i>
<i>Who cares will we get there?</i>

1576
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:21,800
<i>Let's worry about it on our way</i>

1577
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:25,600
<i>Don't think</i>

1578
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:29,160
<i>Why worry that we haven't met earlier?</i>

1579
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:33,240
<i>Let's know each other</i>

1580
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:37,360
<i>When we wander aimlessly</i>
<i>Why worry?</i>

1581
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,800
<i>Just walk with me</i>

1582
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:44,760
<i>I'll follow your lead blindly</i>

1583
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,440
<i>Just walk with me</i>

1584
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:52,360
<i>Let's take a step</i>

1585
