00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Dedicated

2
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:25,974
Ghetto

3
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:27,790
Ghetto

4
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,991
Come on, I'm coming again-

5
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,763
What Dad?

6
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:35,426
We are late

7
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,415
بريم بريم

8
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,883
They say that Rocky is the feast of brothers and sisters, but in our place (sister covenant of brotherhood)

9
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:42,628
A trick to make young boys brothers

10
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:45,262
Caim Eshid

11
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,016
..We are more afraid of magic than that

12
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:51,486
Do not let the girls of the neighborhood or their families turn us into brothers of the girls of the neighborhood

13
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:55,685
For all of us boys, we wake up at 5 in the morning and stand in the temple

14
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,039
But the bad news does not delay. See another boy martyred

15
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:04,428
Brother .. Brother

16
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,174
what happened?

17
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,158
I have bad news

18
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:09,400
Take a deep breath

19
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:11,800
Brother Bora, I have bad news that four boys have been martyred

20
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,801
The ghetto became his father's friend

21
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,709
Did his father come? Who brought it?

22
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,142
Your local kid, Aurora

23
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:27,784
The executioner came every year to see Aurora

24
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:30,773
Dadash Jaidio Uncle Notial

25
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,029
Please let me go carefree

26
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,279
Shall I worry?

27
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:35,149
Are you a taxi for me to be carefree?

28
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,409
Mr. Sharma and Pandy, come on

29
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:40,777
I did not do anything, please let me go

30
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,734
How do I let go? First, what is your relationship with Rito?

31
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,360
Reto J? Cdum Reto?

32
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,853
Grandmother is lying

33
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,255
I saw it myself and kicked it up to here

34
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,122
Are you kidding or not?

35
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,596
wait

36
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,443
Go call Rito

37
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,601
Now I understand who Rito is, I have nothing to do with him -

38
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:05,459
Shut up! Are you lying to your grandmother?

39
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:07,765
Dad, what are you doing? بفرما ريتو اومد -

40
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:12,264
The bride's chest is rocky

41
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:15,009
Take it

42
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,484
Take Eki and tie her hand

43
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,425
Yalla with a clause

44
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:21,983
What are you doing, Rito?

45
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,481
No, I do not want to

46
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,563
Close Close

47
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,782
Close it tightly

48
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:31,695
Rito No, what are you doing? ! این راکیه

49
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:33,371
no no

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,324
So sweeten his mouth

51
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,507
Sweeten your mouth

52
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:39,907
Congratulations .. Congratulations

53
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:44,963
Take it, I will not see you again, this is your sister

54
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,471
You made a bad nose at me! I will settle with you later

55
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:52,917
Uncle Notial was from Rito and I have three

56
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,423
Prepare the raki

57
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:02,550
I asked the fish what it's up to you

58
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,759
But he did not dare to answer, he was dumb

59
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:14,048
I said I dared to remember your grandfather, he was brave

60
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,807
He said to the English with a roar

61
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:22,960
If two states do not belong to me, I will set fire to London

62
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:28,352
Your grandfather was a cheetah; چیتا

63
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:31,775
Grandmother, my cheetah will come one day

64
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,926
Just like Grandpa

65
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,610
I saw these girls myself in the vegetable market, in the Gupta market

66
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,494
Everyone knows that there were two others before the fish

67
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:46,699
I say this is to release many girls

68
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,274
Everyone listens to English songs and shouts on the phone

69
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:56,338
I say look for the groom soon

70
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:59,330
And marry the nose with Rito

71
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:04,079
Otherwise, one day he will run away with one of the local boys

72
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,062
Don't tell Dad, the girls of the place of sisters and mothers

73
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,092
Isn't it a ghetto?

74
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:15,156
When God did not give me a sister, why should I call my nose a sister?

75
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,750
Aurora nose, the love of my shorts (childhood)

76
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,320
It is not an ordinary cracker

77
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:24,982
We used to go to school together from Atsheh brand every day

78
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:28,767
As children, we used to play with dolls and aunts

79
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:35,038
I did more homework than playing cricket

80
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:37,798
I was at their house every Eid

81
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,047
But I could never tell him what I wanted

82
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:44,901
Everyone here is sick of making boys brothers to other girls

83
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,134
But now is the time to fall in love, not to become a brother

84
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,126
If I did not get a nose tattoo, change my name

85
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,685
Do it right as if it were not breastfed today

86
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,340
Brother, should I send a friend request?

87
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:57,497
Send him brother without delay

88
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,052
It is not unlikely that he will not make a covenant of brotherhood with me at one time

89
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,575
"There is nothing to be afraid of in love" (referring to Sultan Khan's film)

90
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:02,855
If it was my sister's nose

91
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:05,021
I was your brother-in-law a long time ago

92
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,237
..Get it ... you opened it in our paws

93
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,795
Is it okay to go far?

94
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:12,834
They say 50

95
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:14,635
Then it is time to hit the yogurt

96
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,187
See you there! I took his name and your brother arrived

97
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:19,340
Agu

98
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,211
Brother, will you let me play ghetto today?

99
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:23,285
To play?

100
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:24,653
Your father is the captain from today

101
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,287
Really?

102
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,628
I told you

103
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,096
Honestly, if necessary, I will consult you

104
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,309
How can I contact you?

105
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:32,286
Give me your number

106
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,462
Dad, where was my cell phone?

107
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,515
Yes, where was your mobile phone?

108
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:38,915
Give your sister number

109
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,640
Ghetto I do not give my sister's first law to anyone

110
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,891
Your sister's number, isn't it your bank card password that you do not give to anyone?

111
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,295
So how do I text you?

112
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,877
Brother, if the law changes, I will give it to you

113
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:51,995
Wow, you have rules of flexibility

114
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:55,838
Okay, no problem, go warm yourself

115
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:57,629
Thanks Dadash Ghetto

116
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,701
Tirt hit the rock

117
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:03,412
Okay, don't make fun anymore, let's go

118
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:05,587
Well, let's win the game first

119
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,887
Brother, write a letter in the window

120
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,071
Then it will be clear what he thinks

121
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:19,041
It's a good idea, but what if we reveal it?

122
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,098
Haven't you written a letter yet?

123
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:25,446
When reading it, in fact, unlike the movie, the author's photo is not seen

124
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:28,741
I will tell him my heart first

125
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:30,912
I will send my name later

126
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:42,576

How did my grandmother die? Did you compete with us because of Gita?

188
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:58,836
Understand bore, my chance to get close to my nose in just 13 days

But you can't take your sister-in-law with you to the market alone

198
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:28,321
Go to the ghetto again, I brought home 400 rupees

199
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,557
Any papa

200
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,607
What a second? -

201
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,924
How long will this be?

202
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,954
In my lifetime, I made money by selling tickets or donating in general

203
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:40,268
2 minutes

204
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:44,900
Long live the mother goddess

205
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:47,255
Brother Jagren, we have some help

206
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:48,127
Of course

207
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,311
How much should I give you?

208
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,045

209
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:50,716
Solve it

210
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:51,994
Solve it? Solve it -

211
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:54,726
Long live the mother goddess

212
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,672
Brother Jagren, we have some help

213
00:13:57,188 --> 00:13:58,492
Well, give me 200 receipts

214
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:00,252
Long live the mother goddess

215
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:02,798
Long live the mother goddess

216
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:08,647
400 Rs

217
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,083
Morsi

218
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,098
Come and pack the equipment for 400 rupees

219
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:20,577
It takes ten minutes to collect them, right?

220
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:25,276
You see, you haven't eaten anything since last night, have you?

221
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:28,040
Shall we eat biscuit tea?

222
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:30,141
Shall we eat biscuit tea?

223
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,468
Yes, let's go

224
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,788
Two special

225
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:44,786
My nose I am very saddened by the death of your grandmother

226
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:50,662
But for 13 days I will not be by my side, I will stay

227
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:53,343
See what the funeral is said in English?

228
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,987
Funeral

229
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,951
You were rejected twice in the tenth grade

230
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:00,255
Not twice, not just once

231
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:02,124
Oh

232
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,663
I took a recruitment test this year

233
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,079
eh? this year?

234
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,392
But less than two years have passed since graduating from college

235
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,344
Yes, I took the IM test last year

236
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:15,265
As you know, private companies do not have job security today

237
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,570
Well listen to my Facebook post

238
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:20,610
My dear and old friends, tell me ... with tears

239
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,309
And I will send it to you from the bottom of my heart

240
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:26,191
I wrote that my grandmother died

241
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,230
Come on

242
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,426
Today is 4 pm for the funeral

243
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:36,008
We need your support and prayers for your grandmother's salvation and paradise

244
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:37,895
Is it good from the point of view of Aurora?

245
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:39,160
The best view

246
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:40,063
Post it?

247
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:41,002
Sure

248
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:42,848
My nose says

249
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,790
Can I send you a friend request on Facebook?

250
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:48,164
I also share more people in between

251
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,356
Send Han

252
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:51,634
Let's have tea

253
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:56,070
When the grandmother of the dead

254
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:59,801
Grandma's story ended and my story began

255
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:12,802
: Instagram and our official media telegram @BollyCineOfficial

256
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:31,928
Baby, if you want, I will give you my happiness so that I can be us

257
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:41,927
"Leave me in your heart and close the gaps"

258
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:51,507
I prayed and I just prayed that we would be together every day

259
00:16:54,652 --> 00:17:00,180
"Do not protest in the slightest and be yours"

260
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:03,273
"I will be yours"

261
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,010
"I will be yours"

262
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,370
"I will be yours"

263
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,091
"I will be yours"

264
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:45,049
What I wanted for years "" He wanted, you .. you

265
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:56,081
"That dream in your eyes, you .. you"

266
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:02,315
"Peace of my soul"

267
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:08,226
"And your madness that exists"

268
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:17,724
I prayed and just prayed "" that I am more and more present day by day

269
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:28,155
"Let me not protest in the slightest and be yours"

270
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,586
"I will be yours"

271
00:18:35,556 --> 00:18:38,689
"I will be yours"

272
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:43,705
"I will be yours"

273
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,401
You should have been to God

274
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:14,320
We set fire to Grandma on the sandals

275
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:17,617
The Ghetto Notial was the seat of parliament there

276
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,289
All the families were just ghettos ghettos, do this ghetto, do that

277
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,951
In other words, we have never had such a Barat in the place similar to the mourning of the grandmother (Barat: the groom's caravan)

278
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,089
You should have died

279
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:34,528
I had an order, but next time "we will dance at a wedding"

280
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:39,133
Waesta

281
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,297
Brother, today we have the right to water and flowers here

282
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:44,962
Yes, we are right

283
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,458
Without a doubt

284
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:50,688
You see, you have to leave the engine and go with the rickshaw

285
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:51,968
Yes, careless

286
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,397
Oh come on come on

287
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,673
good luck

288
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:00,719
How are you?

289
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,159
Who?

290
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:10,043
Pia .. Pia

291
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:11,117
What?

292
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:12,645
come

293
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:18,836
get on

294
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:20,767
Why are you laughing so much?

295
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,136
get on

296
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:31,238
Brother, all your grandeur was questioned

297
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:33,081
I threw the whole ghetto

298
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,996
I will go first, you are the third and Bora is the eleventh

299
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,336
Did you drop your plan? Now gather up and go

300
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:41,119
What is it today, brother?

301
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,498
Are you a captain?

302
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:46,226
He does not know how to take the handle and becomes a captain

303
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:49,498
: The second law of life I do not tolerate insults, be careful

304
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:52,910
Take this one, otherwise I will empty my knots on this head

305
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:56,004
Go, otherwise you will see badly

306
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:56,662
be careful

307
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:58,026
go away

308
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:00,704
Unconscious brother

309
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:03,929
Its fragrance is still in my nose

310
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:05,714
He passed me so close

311
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,576
Unconscious comrade; It happens in love

312
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:12,326
پاشو بريم

313
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,395
No you go. Go

314
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:16,720
I do not want to start the game with you -

315
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:21,780
This is how my life started, now let me start the game

316
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:32,888
Ghetto .. he plays cricket. Aunt

317
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:37,316
Guto .. don't play cricket today

318
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:40,617
He plays, you said he must play

319
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:44,090
I made Ajoo the team captain

320
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,006
Yes, you are very kind

321
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:47,509
Listen to the ghetto

322
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,171
My responsibility has increased a lot

323
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:52,361
Grandma has just died and Rito has to get married

324
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:53,477
listen

325
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:58,120
Get these thoughts out of your heart. Goodbye

326
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:02,648
You see, I did all this at my grandmother's ceremony .. did you remember?

327
00:22:02,895 --> 00:22:03,396
Han?

328
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:09,264
You helped me for four days, now you want to leave me alone?

329
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:10,781
Rocky tie my hand?

330
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:13,039
Today I will finish your story with Rocky

331
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:13,938
That's right

332
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:14,847
nose

333
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:17,888
What? Do something

334
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:21,101
Close Rocky and finish the game

335
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:23,860
I wasted years of effort

336
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:25,508
Bring and close

337
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,844
It is as if you are expressing love to a girl for the first time

338
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:33,453
That's why I forgive you this time

339
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:36,855
But ghetto requires a lot of courage for this love

340
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:40,455
You are so brave, tell me, what should I do?

341
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:46,533
Well, I'm standing in front of your house tonight

342
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,982
You see my bare feet all night

343
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,070
Bye

344
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,206
But come on

345
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,223
Where are my sandals?

346
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,439
I went to the bank today, but I did not go to the temple

347
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,254
Dad, I brought you chocolate bread

348
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,335
I have indigestion

349
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,517
I did not come through the back door

350
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,169
Dad, don't be angry

351
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,545
I decided to put this on the back of a big tattoo

352
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,173
What? Do you want to get a tattoo? Shah Rukh Khan Shi?

353
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:43,461
It is as if we have not punished you for a long time

354
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:47,317
In the same way, the mouth of the nation is called the boy of grass

355
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,301
Do you want to look for a job or just dust off?

356
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,805
Dad's not even offered to study -

357
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,515
Look, my son is going to be an officer

358
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,049
Tattoos are not suitable for your job

359
00:23:57,281 --> 00:24:01,825
Mom, when should I get a tattoo? Only spend 5 thousand more

360
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:02,847
5 Hazar?

361
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:06,149
Have you ever seen 5000 rupees together?

362
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,491
5000 rupees 24 hours just go

363
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:13,093
Lekno tourists also see you and turn their way

364
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:19,095
5000 rupees, see Wangen's son going out and what are you doing?

365
00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:21,982
Everyone lives here

366
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:23,239
It looks like a big house

367
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:26,095
They do not know what is going on in the world

368
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:27,229
What are you looking for?

369
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,584
Sandlam! I did not find them in the morning

370
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,099
Be sure to put it under the bed

371
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:33,043
I was not there at first

372
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:38,140
Dad that blue chair?

373
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:39,351
Yes, so which one?

374
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:42,649
The ones I gave to Bora had his seat torn

375
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:46,529
Did you give the chair?

376
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:48,646
Did you give it to Bora?

377
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:49,381
Yeah

378
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:51,573
Why didn't you give him your chair?

379
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:54,748
Are your two legs decorated with diamonds?

380
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,037
Did you give me sandals?

381
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:59,318
If you worked, you would buy new sandals for your dad every week

382
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,427
And he gave me my chair

383
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,442
If you were a worker, you would pay for tattoos

384
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,802
You just yell at me

385
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,836
Yeah! why not? So why sandals?

386
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,660
Give me my clothes too, Bora, I walk naked in the street, go

387
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,575
!Nude

388
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:19,468
Pashoo Pashoo and go out

389
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,072
Here is an example

390
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,835
Okay Dad, I'm going out and staying out all night

391
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:27,174
Yes, go out

392
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:28,207
Let's do it again

393
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:29,709
No, my mom is dying

394
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,228
And if you are right, why not come all night? -

395
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,390
Well, I'm gone, I do not want your food

396
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,927
Go and get out

397
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:37,414
I do not want to stay with you

398
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:38,986
Is it all your fault? -

399
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:42,112
So what? Do you fight, do you think I'm afraid of you?

400
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,239
The right place for Mardesi and Ann Salad Row?

401
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,788
Do I do everything?

402
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:47,027
I make salad

403
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,685
what is this? A shirt full of water will not be available from tomorrow

404
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,613
What do you say madam?

405
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:43,832
Go

406
00:26:47,928 --> 00:26:48,688
Stupid

407
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:54,169
Give it to Shirinash

408
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:57,537
Give me one

409
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:03,464
Speed ​​up the next one

410
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:05,904
I eat too much

411
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:09,697
Give me the first one. I already stood here

412
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:12,234
I do not eat muftis, I pay

413
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:15,574
Did you think you were the hero of an old Indian movie?

414
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:17,868
And you go out at night and I get bored?

415
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,345
This is stupidity, not courage

416
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,025
What is your nose? -

417
00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:26,105
Let me talk to you for a moment

418
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:26,933
What?

419
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,135
Respect the neighbor, come for a second, I have a card

420
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:38,932
I do not like to chase you, I am civilized

421
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:44,197
I say today what I have been preparing myself to say for years

422
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:48,757
I love you, you decide what to do?

423
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:55,678
Do you only know how to whisper or do you have the courage to work?

424
00:27:57,452 --> 00:27:59,685
I will do whatever you want

425
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,412
Come with me

426
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:07,637
Where do you see me?

427
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,837
this? Yeah -

428
00:28:19,093 --> 00:28:20,541
Do you want to kill me?

429
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:21,454
Are you from Asqi?

430
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:22,961
Go offer your love

431
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,586
Bini, look at his arms, it suffocates me

432
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,178
Go

433
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:27,908
OK

434
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,941
Run your nose

435
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:52,859
Ghetto I do not like fugitives

436
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,267
You want to do something, do it right

437
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:55,556
You love to express love

438
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,146
No, look at all these girls ... go

439
00:28:59,082 --> 00:28:59,618
What?

440
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:00,728
Express love

441
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:02,699
What the hell? -

442
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:08,007
My last nose is killing me

443
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:08,625
OK

444
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:13,927
You will destroy us in the end

445
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:21,728
OK

446
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:52,115
..I think so

447
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,024
No problem, my son, next time

448
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:55,389
Listen to the nose

449
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:58,756
I say I am going to express my love to one of the girls in the park

450
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:00,840
Well, let me tell you

451
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,482
I express my love to you, huh?

452
00:30:06,624 --> 00:30:08,063
Bin .. Bin

453
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:11,159
Ok be friends with me at least

454

Bye

455
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,357
My neighbor, you are comfortable

456
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,153
From house to house

457
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,863
That was nothing

458
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,049
The principle of courage must be done now

459
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:24,538
All these tests that you take from me were not even in Sita's courtship

460
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,863
Go and propose to my brother

461
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:28,483
What if I did then?

462
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,186
Do not retreat

463
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:32,776
I do not! Go courting first

464
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:33,961
Go

465
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:39,970
No, I'm seeing

466
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,596
The one who made six blades?

467
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:47,348
Oh, this beard, yes, thank you, aunt

Brother, how long do you see the profile on the site? Now is the time to marry a girl

471
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:03,006
Well, I'm doing this, you're very worried, ‌ oh?

472
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,443
Who?

473
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:09,852

474
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:11,253
Yeh again

475
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:17,419
Is it over?

476
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,097
Yes look now -

477
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,244
Do you have anything else to do?

478
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:27,282
No then I go?

479
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:28,050
Yeah

480
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:30,199
OK

481
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:36,795
The ghetto of this fraud

482
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:39,198
What fraud? You said talk about marriage with my brother

483
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:41,669
You did not say talk about our marriage

484
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:45,335
You are looking at Rito profiles

485
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:51,679
I beg you to ask me out of all the cities of Lucknow

486
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:20,679
"I do not know what happened, but something has changed."

487
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:24,622
"If I do not know anything"

488
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,927
"Tell me what happened?"

489
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:31,743
"What is going to happen is me and you are"

490
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:34,959
"You are in front of me, but there is also sadness"

491
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:38,903
"The reason for my tears and the smile on my lips is you"

492
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:49,148
"I broke up with you in your memory"

493
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:57,801
"I broke up with you in your memory"

494
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:05,033
"I broke up with you in your memory"

495
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:11,457
"I broke up with you in your memory"

496
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:17,012
"In your memory"

497
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:28,706
God forbid we see each other somewhere "" that there is no one

498
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:36,094
"The place and the way that were not important to us before"

499
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:41,321
"I woke up to the feeling of the night's morning."

500
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:45,117
Why do I feel mine when I see you as an alien?

501
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:49,054
"I want to understand you, but the words are incomplete."

502
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,045
"Tell me what happened?"

503
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:56,101
"What should happen? I am and you are"

504
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:59,606
"You are ahead but you are still sad"

505
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:07,066
"The reason for my tears and the smile on my lips is you"

506
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:12,105
"I got lost in your memory, I got lost"

507
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:21,200
"I broke up with myself"

508
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:28,338
"I'm lost in your memory, too."

509
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:35,684

not your business?

517
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:58,281
What did it have to do with you? You made my love my sister

518
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,377
You had no offer, if you had something to say

519
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:03,345
I did not have it that day, but I have it today

520
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,477

00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:04,089
eh? Are you in a hurry?

550
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:07,909
Break the roof and come here soon

551
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,525
I will go to work to pass the exam

552
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:16,648
Then see, our wedding will be the biggest wedding in the place

553
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:18,711
Look behind the ghetto

554
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:22,879
Come on, where did you go after another ghetto?

555
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:26,625
24 hours by phone

556
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:28,841
I will call later

557
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,505
Where are you wetting your nails? Crow chicks

558
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,556
Dad, why are you cursing yourself?

559
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,854
I curse myself

560
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,110
Because you failed, the test result came

561
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,830
Now where does the car come from with the red light

562
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:42,212
You took my honor

563
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:44,524
Give me the phone, show me

564
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:47,684
The battery is empty

565
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,924
Did I really get rejected?

566
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,796
.. وايستا تو رو

567
00:38:04,536 --> 00:38:05,649
Ghetto

568
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,616
Do you see here?

569
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,976
I am not afraid of anyone, I brought you food and medicine

570
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:14,544
Are you in a lot of pain?

571
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:19,624
I'm not upset that Dad beat me, but I'm sad because he beat me in front of you

572
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,963
Do you want me to say something?

573
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:28,236
I did not even dream that you were in front of me

574
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:33,003
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like it aint for me either

575
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:40,211
But ghetto, I was upset to see you beaten

576
00:38:40,724 --> 00:38:42,539
No, he was my father

577
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:44,939
Otherwise no one can touch me

578
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:49,047
I passed this year, there is no problem, I will test again next year

579
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:51,796
The one who removes the nose will never be rejected

580
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:56,705
See .. I'm a little tired

581
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,125
Ghetto?

582
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:03,489
Okay, give the French a cold kiss

583
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:05,004
After the wedding

584
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:08,920
Okay, listen

585
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:12,389
Let your windows open and boot

586
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:23,319
هوي چيتا

587
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:32,443
چیتا

588
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:25,640
The name of that idiot was rejected in the test

589
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:30,456
My shoes were worn here to pay my tuition

590
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:34,488
And Aghazadeh wants to get a tattoo

591
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:38,400
Play cricket and call 24 hours a day

592
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,368
That's right, uncle, but the punishment is like this

593
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,055
"A baby's feet are seen in a cradle in infancy" (Proverb)

594
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,567
But he got off the cradle, but he did not get up

595
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,198
I'm tired of it

596
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,597
Uncles are upset

597
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,102
You tore four more shirts than me

598
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:00,883
But hit it like this, sprout it .. it won't take long to spoil

599
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:03,068
So you tell me what to do?

600
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:10,123
If you agree, send him to me for work

601
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:14,971
He studies during the day and worships at night

602
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:19,027
As much money as I put in your hands

603
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:21,787
You think, of course, if you agree

604
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,851
It does not want to think

605
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,449
You are heartbroken like a family member

606
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,058
nose

607
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:34,681
Han

608
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:38,998
You became like our family

609
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:42,689
Now, as an adult, I want to tell you something

610
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:44,038
جانم

611
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:47,454
Sitting outside, he watches the nation ghetto

612
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:50,264
Come on, Aghazadeh

613
00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:56,528
Touch his brother's feet, you are going to work with them

614
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,865
No, it is not necessary

615
00:41:58,408 --> 00:42:02,216
And now tell them everything about the nose .. Yala

616
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,771
What Daddy?

617
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:09,196
Your sister, your sister, your sister ... Tell me

618
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:11,309
Say exactly

619
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:16,194
Hello Uncle, Hello Brother Hello Aunt

620
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:19,334
The ghetto is going to be late for the race

621
00:42:19,634 --> 00:42:23,922
how are you? - I'm fine - Can you give me some yogurt?

622
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,746
Get the ghetto

623
00:42:36,585 --> 00:42:40,210
Hey, what is the problem in the ceremony? Are you working or playing mobile?

624
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:42,966
Check the microphone is ringing, go

625
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,664
Why did you do this? Where is Mandip?

626
00:42:49,314 --> 00:42:52,686
Do not play the role of Shiva on this first day. Go and see where Mandip is.

627
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:54,508
I see the eyes

628
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,499
No ghetto, I came to talk to you

629
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:06,292
Ghetto Two, I'm upset for three days

630
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:07,909
What happened bro?

631
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:15,029
Tell the truth, who are you and Bora related to?

632
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,293
I do not know, brother

633
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,200
Isn't this the same as selling milk?

634
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,800
Who is milking us? say

635
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,765
Our brother?

636
00:43:32,465 --> 00:43:39,294
Look at the ghetto, you see for me and you are no different

637
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,080
You are my brother

638
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,664
Brother? How about

639
00:43:44,048 --> 00:43:44,759
Aren't you a brother?

640
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,896
!No! what happened? Tell me, brother

641
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:50,719
For the last time I ask, tell the truth

642
00:43:51,357 --> 00:43:52,765
Bora and Bini from whom with the same?

643
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:56,339
Do you say

644
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:05,692
I know you do not call me friendship and purity, but this is your silence

645
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:08,883
He said everything

646
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:12,140
..Bora no brother

647
00:44:12,507 --> 00:44:14,879
No, I did not understand enough

648
00:44:16,383 --> 00:44:18,609
It's not your fault you brush the card

649
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,880
Son of Dapi Dada and Bini?

650
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:34,479
Brother, is this the same milk seller?

651
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,334
But we had not bought milk from him for a long time

652
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:39,223
We have been closed since then

653
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:41,135
How did you find out?

654
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:42,439
From the ghetto

655
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:50,132
Brother, in this wedding riot, I will be notorious

656
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:52,209
You do not have to worry about this happening

657
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:56,009
But no one should be informed

658
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:07,945
Jaydio is the truth of crap and people who say infamous sisters

659
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,785
We are upset as a neighbor, but how can I say that?

660
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:13,199
What do you say, Aunt John? I'm right

661
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:16,575
He saw himself riding in a Bora car

662
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:21,037
Come on .. my son, today's generation, not with breast milk

663
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:26,755
Instead, it should be kept on the line with the enlarged mobile valve

664
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:30,840
I tore four more shirts than you, so I say do nothing

665
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:37,448
Because love in your youth is normal

666
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,752
What happens if you close the top of the Ferrari engine?

667
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:45,145
He smokes nothing more and goes to the tree in front of him

668
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:48,434
So just watch it

669
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:51,619
How do I monitor it? Do I work or ..?

670
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:55,668
You made us neighbors again, we are families

671
00:45:56,584 --> 00:46:00,368
Let Rito's wedding be over and see you later

672
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:01,961
..If in front of all the place

673
00:46:02,365 --> 00:46:06,677
I did not force Dapi Dada's son to tie a rock, I am not older than you

674
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:11,879
Jaydio, you simply do not understand that you are not married yet

675
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:15,362
Remember today

676
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:20,285
Bini does not have two brothers but three brothers

677
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:22,966
So, Aju and Gato

678
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:28,148
Come to the meditation house and get out of the ghetto

679
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:34,585
Ghetto .. The girls of this place are the sisters of the boys

680
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:40,713
From today, be very careful about your nose

681
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:45,045
Take him to college in the morning .. and bring him home at noon and yes

682
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:48,736
Be careful not to meet Bora, do you understand?

683
00:46:49,896 --> 00:46:52,577
What time does he go to college in the morning?

684
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,477
8 oclock

685
00:47:00,706 --> 00:47:01,722
See you later -

686
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:06,769
I hit your brother in the face and he told me to take you to college

687
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:09,697
What? Sarkar? What did you do

688
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,772
We are now in the heart of your whole family

689
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:19,734
Ghetto, someone is watching us, tell his brother; OK?

690
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:24,098
I tell your brother to look at your superstitious time

691
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:28,570
You were mine and you will be mine

692
00:47:32,313 --> 00:47:33,877
I have two good news

693
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:38,279
First, liking Rito means connecting

694
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,891
Long live your mother goddess, sweeten your mouth

695
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:45,103
We sweeten my mouth, listen to the second one

696
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:47,696
Aunt Raj and Aunt Husband came that day

697
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:50,772
Their son Rahul works in France

698
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:53,205
I like my nose

699
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,823
I sent you my profile for two weddings together

700
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:02,435
..Aunt .. nose

701
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:04,653
Is he studying? Is that what you want to say?

702
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:07,765
Well, going to France to continue your education is not important

703
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:08,720
Think about it

704
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:10,975
The family does not get along so well

705
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:15,537
No, your aunt ordered Matin and the family is very good

706
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:16,841
So what is the problem?

707
00:48:17,835 --> 00:48:20,985
Invite you to their temple tomorrow

708
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:24,051
Bring the two to the wedding immediately

709
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:26,673
Now we sweeten our mouths

710
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:36,350
Bora, do not worry

711
00:48:37,725 --> 00:48:40,477
This is an opportunity to put a class in front of his brother

712
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:43,419
He thinks I solved the problem

713
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:47,743
What does he want to do? Rocky closes well close-

714
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,198
I think it is not a problem, great plans

715
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:52,113
Jaydio wakes up

716
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:57,507
Oh, only the sisters are not infamous, the whole neighborhood is becoming infamous

717
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:05,399
coming

718
00:49:05,998 --> 00:49:07,370
My sister

719
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,027
Hello Uncles Hello Brother

720
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:10,567
See my son

721
00:49:10,854 --> 00:49:11,536
Uncle

722
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:16,663
Knox, are you kidding me? Han?

723
00:49:16,822 --> 00:49:18,491
Who do you think you are? No bro -

724
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:22,441
If I see you around my sister again, I will kill you

725
00:49:23,036 --> 00:49:26,900
I brought my money, take the money for your shirt, ghetto, understand this

726
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,002
You are a nose brother, be

727
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,248
How dare you raise your hand against me?

728
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:32,696
Not a job

729
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:33,729
get lost

730
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,098
My mother has not raised her hand in Rome yet

731
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:37,385
Oh dear pain you do not know I am the son of Kiyam -

732
00:49:37,762 --> 00:49:38,555
No one is afraid of you

733
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,986
I will cut your shirt from all over the city, then drink your tea and drink it

734
00:49:42,463 --> 00:49:43,023
Yes, I do

735
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,109
The property works

736
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,932
Go Daddy, wait for me

737
00:49:47,762 --> 00:49:49,241
Dude, what are you doing? -

738
00:49:50,477 --> 00:49:51,531
You should not criticize firmly

739
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:53,906
Dapi Dadash's son

740
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:57,129
What?

741
00:49:57,409 --> 00:49:59,338
We brought a coward to beat me here

742
00:49:59,816 --> 00:50:00,609
No carelessness

743
00:50:01,907 --> 00:50:03,323
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange

744
00:50:03,718 --> 00:50:04,203
I know

745
00:50:05,326 --> 00:50:06,841
Leave your nose until the night of this dead

746
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:10,293
This family is crazy

747
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:11,536
Calm down

748
00:50:15,573 --> 00:50:18,723
You said I was going to close Rocky, I came too, but he knocked under my ear

749
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,719
There is no problem, I will solve it, do not cry

750
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:24,689
Is the meat good?

751
00:50:25,265 --> 00:50:28,298
Where is it good? Is whistling

752
00:50:28,578 --> 00:50:31,248
Well, let me see, not good meat

753
00:50:32,813 --> 00:50:37,086
Bora, my brother-in-law is going to come, I will compensate you

754
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,538
ميزنمش

755
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:42,162
Miznimsh Bora carefree .. Do not cry

756
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,566
Do you hate beer?

757
00:50:47,998 --> 00:50:49,454
No, I do not drink beer, I want juice

758
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,235
Okay, let's go to Juice

759
00:50:57,107 --> 00:51:00,533
Why don't you tell me what you have to do with Bora?

760
00:51:01,649 --> 00:51:07,865
My God, the standing fortune teller whistles the flesh

761
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:09,801
close

762
00:51:11,097 --> 00:51:12,257
You are not human

763
00:51:13,025 --> 00:51:13,897
What are you doing, Judeo?

764
00:51:14,252 --> 00:51:16,586
what do I do? You see what mommy is doing

765
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,971
My grandmother's life, I swear I have nothing to do with Bora

766
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:22,191
Let go of Grandma, swear by my life

767
00:51:22,766 --> 00:51:23,273
Mom for a moment

768
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:26,975
Brother, I swear to you, I have nothing to do with Bora Sanami

769
00:51:27,983 --> 00:51:30,519
Did you see mom? I also killed

770
00:51:31,443 --> 00:51:32,607
Where is your mobile?

771
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:34,373
ایناهاش داداش

772
00:51:34,683 --> 00:51:37,721
Stay in front of you, don't take it, take it with you

773
00:51:38,123 --> 00:51:40,363
Rito is not your wedding issue

774
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:42,455
Break your mobile

775
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:44,143
Rito Shut up-

776
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:46,260
Everything is under your head

777
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:48,039
Silent

778
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:50,920
Everyone listen to me

779
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:01,758
See, tomorrow is Rito's engagement and my fiancé is coming for you

780
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:07,118
Please do not be your sister's enemy, her connection has been confirmed

781
00:52:10,151 --> 00:52:14,887
You see your fiancé, no father sees you

782
00:52:16,606 --> 00:52:17,407
Mom, let's go somewhere

783
00:52:17,694 --> 00:52:18,576
my son

784
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:20,318
Han say

785
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,206
You too, go with your mobile

786
00:52:22,616 --> 00:52:23,894
Didn't you read Mandip?

787
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:25,611
Come back

788
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:28,882
Okay, call the ghetto

789
00:52:31,018 --> 00:52:31,760
Aunt John?

790
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:35,401

Grim Shirawali is crooked, go and see him

793
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,597
I inadvertently hit Bora Ghetto

794
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:00,638
I raised my hand to my nose

795
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,620
Hands out of control

796
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:05,180
I just want everything to be right

797
00:53:06,075 --> 00:53:07,137
And Rito's wedding should not be canceled

798
00:53:08,992 --> 00:53:11,191
Did you talk to Bora?

799
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,523
No, brother, I did not speak

800
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,934
My decision is absolutely right

801
00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:19,339
I will nominate Rito Bini tomorrow

802
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:23,980
Do you see a fiancé?

803
00:53:24,797 --> 00:53:29,556
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either

804
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,118
I'm careful there, be careful here

805
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:35,740
One brother there, one here

806
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:36,739
Ok ghetto?

00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,935

820
00:54:28,906 --> 00:54:31,079
See the master. He wants to hit the lamb

I came to talk to a lawyer

826
00:54:57,006 --> 00:54:58,134

00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:10,052
Give me your engine switch, but what happened? -

You did not even tell me

840
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:32,227

00:55:33,299 --> 00:55:38,379

Benny Haqiqq shortened it

850
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:14,230
Why is it your fault? It's my fault I had to tell them

851
00:57:15,885 --> 00:57:17,245
I should have told Jadio too

852
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:22,493
Ghetto, do not cut off communication with me no matter what happens, right?

853
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:26,423
I can not see you without you. I apologize from the bottom of my heart

854
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,440
Why do you apologize? It is not your fault

855
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,912
Shall we escape the ghetto?

No, you are not a firecracker

860
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,155
Okay, I'm talking to Jadeio

861
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:53,800
No, Rito's wedding is going to hurt me, you think

862
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:57,946
Find a way to make the nose yours and Rito the groom

863
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,906
Look, I got a notorious ghetto, he's with his brother Bora

After hearing your voice, I realized where your daughters' voice went

870
00:58:30,835 --> 00:58:35,139
Brother Mandip called and said he could not come at night

871
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,056
Let him know

872
00:58:37,663 --> 00:58:39,271

873
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:40,639

00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:27,396
No, do not say that

895
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:31,944
Ratios in their place and literature in their place

896
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,213
Brother sent you a gift

897
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:36,709

902
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:53,210

00:59:54,718 --> 00:59:56,546
Well .. give me?

904
00:59:57,403 --> 01:00:04,877
Wow, very romantic, but you know your fiancé

01:00:05,341 --> 01:00:06,085
it's true

906
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:11,115
Hello nose, how are you?

907

I am fine

908
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:17,979
So I finally saw you

909
01:00:18,955 --> 01:00:22,042
Thank you for showing me your face

910
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:26,446
Because I became a fan of your singing in France

911
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,885
My mother sent the clip, I saw it

912
01:00:32,949 --> 01:00:40,046
Then I saw him and I saw him again and then

913
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,529
Anyway, this gift is yours, iPhone

914
01:00:46,531 --> 01:00:50,683
If you record a good song, send it to me

915
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:52,740
Thankful

916
01:00:53,572 --> 01:00:55,172
Are you proud of me for my coffee?

917
01:00:57,814 --> 01:01:01,517
In fact, it is better to ask his brother

918
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,447
Well, I came to ask my brother

919
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:12,144
And you are so beautiful

920
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,405
Brother, let's sit down and go down

921
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:22,674
The food is ready in ten minutes

922
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:26,665
Brother, I do not eat, but I want your permission

923
01:01:26,953 --> 01:01:29,896
Can I invite my nose for coffee?

924
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:31,025
If you know

925
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:32,595
Do not take the one who did not say he will not come?

926
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,212
No, he did not say anything

927
01:01:34,452 --> 01:01:35,247
So nothing I say thank you -

928
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:38,480
I really have a problem, brother

929
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:39,555
Shio

930
01:01:39,907 --> 01:01:41,251
Excuse me, the problem is that

931
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:45,555
I got a phone for my nose but I did not get a SIM card

932
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:51,329
I will be happy if you buy Tony a SIM card

933
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:56,106
Thank you so much

934
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:58,482
ID card?

935
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:00,426
ID card? what is it?

936
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,199
nothing

937
01:02:04,613 --> 01:02:05,909
I'm sorry, thank you very much

938
01:02:15,851 --> 01:02:18,997
Please be patient

939
01:02:19,243 --> 01:02:19,937
Thankful

940
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:27,864
So goodbye kids goodbye sister husband -

941
01:02:28,185 --> 01:02:28,907
Will I come next time?

942
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:31,186
Yes, I will take you

943
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:32,411
Goodbye buddy

944
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:45,412
: Specialized translation of our cultural and artistic media Translators: Bingsa and Huzair

945
01:02:46,547 --> 01:02:48,603
The ghetto was in good spirits

946
01:02:48,986 --> 01:02:51,932
Return the rest of the money to me or I will tell my son-in-law

947
01:02:54,461 --> 01:02:55,799
Dear brother

948
01:03:18,189 --> 01:03:27,037
"This is what I asked to reach you"

949
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:34,875
"I can tell you and you will understand me soon"

950
01:03:36,004 --> 01:03:39,182
Bini: What should I do? Ghetto: Rahul is with me

951
01:03:41,006 --> 01:03:47,572
Ghetto: Is he with you or are you constantly clinging to him?

952
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:51,709
"Yehoo Az Square Didit Ghayb Shhem"

953
01:03:52,479 --> 01:03:55,124
"And no one can find me"

954
01:03:55,748 --> 01:04:03,893
"This is what I ask God to do for you."

955
01:04:05,069 --> 01:04:11,820
"I can speak my mind and you will understand soon"

956
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:15,719
Luck was on, a first-rate boy was caught

957
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,287
Exactly from the husband of God

958
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:26,885
Everything is getting right, ghetto

959
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:30,319
Yogurt is closing in on them

960
01:04:31,846 --> 01:04:35,386
Bora left the field, be ready

961
01:04:35,681 --> 01:04:43,961
"If you are not with me, I will lose my purpose."

962
01:04:49,353 --> 01:04:57,805
"I'm heartbroken to not see you for a moment."

963
01:04:58,596 --> 01:05:02,960
"I do not want to live without you"

964
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:07,495
"You were the only purpose of my life"

965
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:14,198
"No one is mine except you"

966
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:23,348
"This is what I asked God to do for you."

967
01:05:24,867 --> 01:05:31,844
"And I can speak my heart and you will understand"

968
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:42,738
"This is what I asked God to do for you."

969
01:05:55,081 --> 01:06:00,098
Your fortune does not match

970
01:06:01,298 --> 01:06:03,560
Bora I do not understand anything

971
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,290
Why is a person named Rahul clear? Han?

972
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:20,577
That movie was the bond of friendship in that movie. When did you get the girl out of Salman's clutches?

973
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:24,195
Rahul

974
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:28,897
And the film is so crazy, do you even get caught?

975
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:33,002
Rahul

976
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:36,482
What was Delwaleh that he sold for years?

977
01:06:37,065 --> 01:06:39,377
دیلواله! I saw him

978
01:06:39,785 --> 01:06:41,409
That comedy movie

979
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,882
When did he take his wife from that husband?

980
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:46,956
To the wind

981
01:06:47,267 --> 01:06:48,156
Rahul

982
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,239
No, no bro

983
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:54,835
He was Raj

984
01:06:55,964 --> 01:07:00,363
Raj Rahul both start with "R" and have the same horoscope

985
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:02,348
Both are similar

986
01:07:04,516 --> 01:07:07,148
It's over. Everything is over

987
01:07:09,723 --> 01:07:15,932
If your story is not romantic but it becomes a crime

988
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,740
Brother, the only cure for the Rahul virus is something

989
01:07:22,399 --> 01:07:22,997
What?

990
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:27,693
Death .. The cure is death

991
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:36,569
What are you saying

992
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:37,806
No

993
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:39,318
بیخيال

994
01:07:40,054 --> 01:07:44,643
You have no supply to shoot, we will kill him in an accident

995
01:07:45,419 --> 01:07:47,139
Do you have a problem with an accident, huh?

996
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:49,812
It's over, Bora

997
01:07:50,604 --> 01:07:53,092
Nothing is over

998
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:56,396
I kill myself and solve the problem

999
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,109
No, brother, nothing is over

1000
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:59,646
Romeo Bade Maryah

1001
01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:01,159
No

1002
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:04,576
Go to the nose and tell Romio he must die

1003
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:10,244
Do not talk about these things, brother, I will kill Rahul

1004
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:19,091
From now on, Bora will be the first young name in every movie

1005
01:08:19,727 --> 01:08:23,358
Where's mecha? Gatu Rahul -

1006
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:27,384
Ghetto .. Ghetto opens his hand

1007
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:33,875
The ghetto opens its hand and the ghetto brother-in-law becomes Bora

1008
01:08:34,336 --> 01:08:36,560
Bora becomes a ghetto brother .. my sister's brother

1009
01:08:38,163 --> 01:08:42,034
And that guy himself could not get a wife, he tells me

1010
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:44,930
You are the brother of your house

1011
01:08:46,058 --> 01:08:47,315
From Shuhrkhwahrsham

1012
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,916
Brother, you take it and I dance at your wedding

1013
01:08:52,172 --> 01:08:53,711
No, I do not wear a robe (men's wedding dress)

1014
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:57,955
And the girl does not die on top of the Eiffel Tower

1015
01:08:59,938 --> 01:09:02,801
The girl goes to the top of our clock tower

1016
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:05,565
The girl goes to the top of the Eiffel Tower at nine o'clock

1017
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:09,040
Girl, not my sister, she goes to the clock tower and you bring her down, brother

1018
01:09:09,648 --> 01:09:13,048
Guto noise

1019
01:09:13,504 --> 01:09:14,377
Geto

1020
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,815
And Rahul?

1021
01:09:16,963 --> 01:09:18,184
Rahul who died in an accident

1022
01:09:19,008 --> 01:09:20,588
ميکشيمش

1023
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,638
Mishimesh is a friend

1024
01:09:27,212 --> 01:09:27,875
listen

1025
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,246
Who is there?

1026
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:42,119
Hey boys, did you drink wine?

1027
01:09:42,559 --> 01:09:44,044
We did not drink wine or beer

1028
01:09:44,677 --> 01:09:45,357
What?

1029
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:49,996
Uncles, we were heartbroken today, we drank some wine, what happened?

1030
01:09:51,215 --> 01:09:52,231
Bora, rest, I will answer

1031
01:09:53,734 --> 01:09:54,879
what happened?

1032
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,567
You sleep .. you sleep .. okay?

1033
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:00,133
Well, Uncle John, I'm dying

1034
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,461
Is V Darren Gargar Makenin?

1035
01:10:05,845 --> 01:10:06,405
Gargar?

1036
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:13,580
Omujan Bora shortening Dusit Rundle realistic from it

1037
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:14,755
A true friend

1038
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,395
Bora wanted to kill him today for love

1039
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:24,971
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either

1040
01:10:25,211 --> 01:10:28,599
Our childhood

1041
01:10:29,478 --> 01:10:33,292
Don't worry, what happened?

1042
01:10:35,009 --> 01:10:39,217
Bora, sleep well

1043
01:10:39,644 --> 01:10:40,412
I sleep

1044
01:10:40,755 --> 01:10:44,137
Well, my uncles, I'm going, I'm a gentleman, I'm going home on time

1045
01:10:44,836 --> 01:10:47,198
Hey ghetto, first tell me who this nose is?

1046
01:10:47,848 --> 01:10:49,395
Benny Omujan?

1047
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:53,645
The nose of love is right

1048
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:54,937
Yes love

1049
01:10:57,858 --> 01:11:02,259
Uncle, when you order milk, then do you understand who you are?

1050
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,080
Order milk?

1051
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:09,378
The father of Shanker Jay's daughter is a religious figure

1052
01:11:12,261 --> 01:11:16,858
Excuse me, my uncle, let me go

1053
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,414
You too sleep cold air, sleep

1054
01:11:21,214 --> 01:11:26,328
I will not kill Bora -

1055
01:11:26,766 --> 01:11:27,783
Good night Uncle John

1056
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:34,158
What made you growl?

1057
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:41,020
Uncle, his heart is broken

1058
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:43,086
Uncles, the news is true

1059
01:11:43,374 --> 01:11:44,866
Everyone knows their love

1060
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,442
And they are forcing the girl to marry and her brother Bora

1061
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:52,168
How dare he touch Bora?

1062
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:54,375
I take all his family and dry them

1063
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:56,334
Uncle John, I will destroy them

1064
01:11:56,703 --> 01:11:58,206
Bashin Baba Bashin

1065
01:12:00,543 --> 01:12:07,223
You see, we can not marry outside our own tribe

1066
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:11,132
That's why we go to see his brother

1067
01:12:11,547 --> 01:12:15,571
And I tell her in favor of your sister

1068
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:19,859
To give her husband to someone else sooner

1069
01:12:20,483 --> 01:12:21,706
Otherwise, Kara will be ruined

1070
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:24,752
And if Bora is seen on the other side of the girl's house

1071
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,056
I peel it myself, yes

1072
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:30,336
Good morning, Amujan

1073
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,595
English bulgur

1074
01:12:33,992 --> 01:12:35,378
Does your mouth hurt? Say Hindi Ram Ram Hindi?

1075
01:12:35,974 --> 01:12:37,959
Who is this nose? come here

1076
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,102
From Nameam

1077
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:41,494
I say come here

1078
01:12:41,919 --> 01:12:44,390
I'm not you, you're busy, you're coming .. I'm not

1079
01:12:44,749 --> 01:12:46,357
Who am I? Dog eggs

1080
01:12:47,253 --> 01:12:49,133
Escaped stupid

1081
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:54,139
Take me to my daughter's brother

1082
01:13:16,644 --> 01:13:17,740
Han Bibin Jaidio

1083
01:13:18,278 --> 01:13:19,172
Jaydeo

1084
01:13:21,804 --> 01:13:25,651
See Jaydio .. The point is that your sister

1085
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:35,322
Listen to your first uncles

1086
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:40,649
Bora had blown up my sister, that's why I hit her

1087
01:13:41,837 --> 01:13:43,970
If you were me, you would do the same

1088
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:47,824
You see, we are poor but honorable and we have a place of honor

1089
01:13:49,731 --> 01:13:52,770
And you are from a family of criminals

1090
01:13:53,938 --> 01:13:57,124
In farming, everyone knows what you do not do

1091
01:13:58,244 --> 01:14:00,676
Now we can not connect with such families

1092
01:14:01,715 --> 01:14:03,880
I'd better kill my sister instead

1093
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:05,891
See uncles are the truth of crap

1094
01:14:06,135 --> 01:14:07,738
Hey, how dare you say this?

1095
01:14:08,602 --> 01:14:10,970
Hey Vijander pull aside

1096
01:14:12,694 --> 01:14:14,191
What's going on?

1097
01:14:14,566 --> 01:14:15,819
What was your son's name?

1098
01:14:16,162 --> 01:14:16,786
Jaydeo

1099
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:20,114
..Jaidio, the first word

1100
01:14:21,145 --> 01:14:24,976
Accept that our family is not respectable

1101
01:14:26,064 --> 01:14:32,240
And what do we do under the cover of the farm?

1102
01:14:34,105 --> 01:14:38,762
Now no one really gives his daughter to such a family

1103
01:14:39,657 --> 01:14:40,075
Yes

1104
01:14:40,912 --> 01:14:42,446
it's true? So listen properly

1105
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:47,915
Your sister can only be our bride and nothing else

1106
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:53,152
Now he wants to get married to his body

1107
01:14:54,675 --> 01:14:57,488
Or we close a farm and marry him

1108
01:14:58,235 --> 01:15:00,314
If she is going to get married, she should be our bride

1109
01:15:00,608 --> 01:15:01,835
Why uncles? how are you?

1110
01:15:02,843 --> 01:15:05,158
eh? What was he saying?

1111
01:15:05,723 --> 01:15:06,706
Omujan

1112
01:15:07,946 --> 01:15:10,930
Uncles, listen, you are getting older

1113
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:13,499
Uncles on your side are smaller

1114
01:15:13,904 --> 01:15:16,023
Hey, why are you begging him to leave Uncle?

1115
01:15:16,463 --> 01:15:17,391
We inform the police

1116
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:20,055
Do you know the police? Do

1117
01:15:20,504 --> 01:15:26,998
Uncle, the police will not stop talking to the army

1118
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:28,959
How do they take our local girl?

1119
01:15:29,979 --> 01:15:30,947
Aren't we in your hands? (Unless we are cowards)

1120
01:15:31,612 --> 01:15:36,475
So what? The bracelet that comes on the wedding day, let's see how we do it

1121
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,441
I raised my sister like my daughter, how are you?

1122
01:15:40,513 --> 01:15:41,713
Touch it and see

1123
01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:44,723
What are you doing wrong? What's wrong?

1124
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:48,411
See what kind of person this is? You are the executioner of the executioner

1125
01:15:48,883 --> 01:15:50,007
Do not touch my husband

1126
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:53,043
Is this your husband?

1127
01:15:53,611 --> 01:15:55,507
Are women stronger than men here?

1128
01:15:57,941 --> 01:16:00,486
Who threw the slippers?

1129
01:16:17,241 --> 01:16:19,672
Bro? Uncle .. run away -

1130
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:10,576
Hi Uncle

1131
01:17:11,135 --> 01:17:15,128
Live is the subject of a girl

1132
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,693
What is their house? there-

1133
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:32,694
: Instagram and our official media telegram @BollyCineOfficial

1134
01:17:34,268 --> 01:17:35,661
Now it comes down to them

1135
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:54,116
Bora and this girl's wedding is certain

1136
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:56,940
If anyone tried to object

1137
01:17:58,325 --> 01:18:01,886
I paint the whole neighborhood with blood

1138
01:18:03,334 --> 01:18:05,116
Just be

1139
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:07,307
Let me bury him

1140
01:18:07,699 --> 01:18:11,850
I just don't want to see Bora

1141
01:18:12,322 --> 01:18:13,595
Lightness Shu

1142
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:16,387
Mom, let the blood get in front of my eyes

1143
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:18,939
See what happens here with your blessing?

1144
01:18:19,187 --> 01:18:20,542
The younger brother has blood in front of his eyes

1145
01:18:21,017 --> 01:18:22,616
And threatening his older brother

1146
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:26,705
I have never seen a selfish girl like you

1147
01:18:27,104 --> 01:18:31,009
How many times can I tell you that I have nothing to do with Bora?

1148
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,787
Call the ghetto and it will tell you the truth

1149
01:18:35,356 --> 01:18:38,971
The ghetto told his brother that he had fallen in love with Bora

1150
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,027
What?

1151
01:18:40,475 --> 01:18:43,891
Yes, the ghetto has been saying that your mast has been closed for a long time.

1152
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:46,146
Ghetto said?

1153
01:18:46,506 --> 01:18:48,858
Susan Gertrude? Goto, goto

1154
01:18:49,195 --> 01:18:52,090
Ghetto Nutial said that he also met Bora

1155
01:18:52,835 --> 01:18:54,787
See you canceled because of your wedding

1156
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:58,407
If my wedding is canceled, I will not let anyone get married

1157
01:18:58,786 --> 01:19:00,658
Open all your ears

1158
01:19:02,107 --> 01:19:06,810
How can I marry my sister? They steal and take them

1159
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:08,711
How to steal? Han?

1160
01:19:09,429 --> 01:19:11,679
We are all here, everything is solved

1161
01:19:12,506 --> 01:19:14,332
Today we must unite

1162
01:19:14,658 --> 01:19:17,202
Do you know the police?

1163
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:21,522
Monga, I'm talking, can I finish?

1164
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:25,441
Thanks, Han I was saying

1165
01:19:26,235 --> 01:19:29,835
What happened to Jadio can happen to us tomorrow

1166
01:19:30,074 --> 01:19:30,811
Yes its true

1167
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:33,836
Right or not?

1168
01:19:34,612 --> 01:19:38,277
As long as we are oppressed, they will continue to be oppressed

1169
01:19:38,961 --> 01:19:41,554
For this reason, it is obligatory to protect our place

1170
01:19:42,275 --> 01:19:44,856
You are absolutely right

1171
01:19:45,818 --> 01:19:49,803
The nose of the bride leaves

1172
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:54,732
If someone else looks left in the nose, we will open their eyes

1173
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:58,696
Yes, we open his eyes

1174
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:04,852
If this neighborhood wants a house, we are ready to donate blood

1175
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:06,808
I am ready

1176
01:20:07,878 --> 01:20:11,495
Do you hear Jaydio? We are all with you

1177
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:15,062
You are accompanied by siblings

1178
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:18,904
Now should we pray to our mother to fight these monsters?

1179
01:20:19,536 --> 01:20:21,769
Yeah why not? We pray

1180
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,721
Long live mother

1181
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:42,585

01:20:57,996 --> 01:20:59,849
"Take away our sorrows"

1189
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:04,030

1198
01:21:37,003 --> 01:21:41,133
"Your court is my home and I have no family but you."

1199
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:45,050
"I have no family but you"

1200
01:21:45,718 --> 01:21:49,724
Hear everyone's prayers. "" Take me to the shore, mother of the ship

1201

How are you?

1216
01:23:12,892 --> 01:23:13,877
Yes how?

1217
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:15,619
No

1218
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:17,180
Let them close the door on you

1219
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,118
Should I close it?

1220
01:23:27,477 --> 01:23:28,866
Come on

1221
01:23:34,698 --> 01:23:38,466
His lower nose became very donkey

1222
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:41,034
But do not worry, I will solve it

1223
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:45,962
You sit down first, you solved everything

1224
01:23:47,492 --> 01:23:50,109
So tell me, do you eat yogurt?

1225
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:54,365
I also eat poison from your nose

1226
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:59,506
Well, then we go up to the roof

1227
01:24:00,338 --> 01:24:01,202
roof top?

1228
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:08,649
From that kind of yogurt?

1229
01:24:09,298 --> 01:24:13,787
The so-called French kiss

1230
01:24:14,242 --> 01:24:15,916
Yes, French

1231
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,083
It's called a French kiss

1232
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:22,867
Are you sure?

1233
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:24,626
Yeah

1234
01:24:25,154 --> 01:24:27,315
Well, we eat yogurt here

1235
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:29,037
Not if anyone remembers

1236
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:32,737
Isn't the roof more fresh now?

1237
01:24:33,322 --> 01:24:34,754
Yes, it does

1238
01:24:35,426 --> 01:24:36,571
Let's go?

1239
01:24:36,995 --> 01:24:37,930
Han Barim

1240
01:24:43,457 --> 01:24:44,195
Ghetto

1241
01:24:45,089 --> 01:24:45,757
Han

1242
01:24:46,307 --> 01:24:52,122
Has your mother told all the locals about this process of milking yogurt?

1243
01:24:53,442 --> 01:24:57,571
yogurt? No, my mother did not say anything

1244
01:24:57,962 --> 01:25:01,976
Is this your family habit a family habit?

1245
01:25:02,943 --> 01:25:03,776
What do you see?

1246
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:04,782
Well let it go

1247
01:25:06,005 --> 01:25:08,700
Did anyone come down to the cover of the mother's ceremony?

1248
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:11,196
Let go of the mother

1249
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,728
Ghetto, tell me more

1250
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,200
Did the mother come or not?

1251
01:25:15,168 --> 01:25:16,129
no how?

1252
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:18,337
I'm not going to come

1253
01:25:19,025 --> 01:25:21,375
Mother is coming here today

1254
01:25:22,597 --> 01:25:23,168
Mother

1255
01:25:27,048 --> 01:25:28,055
nose

1256
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:35,199
Ghetto Tell me, who told everyone about Bora and Bini, huh?

1257
01:25:35,555 --> 01:25:37,456
I did not say

1258
01:25:37,977 --> 01:25:41,035
Ghetto You are not brave and you will never be brave

1259
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:42,984
Long live the mother

1260
01:25:43,335 --> 01:25:45,968
Did you tell Jaydio? You said ghetto

1261
01:25:46,417 --> 01:25:48,489
You betrayed your nose, huh?

1262
01:25:48,864 --> 01:25:49,664
No

1263
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,512
You are a coward

1264
01:25:52,696 --> 01:25:55,016
My mother did not say

1265
01:25:55,355 --> 01:25:56,121
Are you lying?

1266
01:25:56,496 --> 01:26:01,648
No, mother, I am not lying

1267
01:26:04,235 --> 01:26:10,696
Shut up ghetto, why did you do that?

1268
01:26:11,578 --> 01:26:13,538
We were going to win the world together

1269
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:16,330
And today you defeated me

1270
01:26:17,525 --> 01:26:20,555
How many times have I asked you about Bora? several times?

1271
01:26:22,994 --> 01:26:26,298
Do not understand the relationship between siblings? At least you respected him

1272
01:26:27,404 --> 01:26:29,676
Why do you see me? -

1273
01:26:36,477 --> 01:26:38,767
You destroyed my life

1274
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,686
I wanted to tell you

1275
01:26:40,967 --> 01:26:49,334
I wanted to tell you

1276
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,544
Nasal eye? Ghetto?

1277
01:26:53,494 --> 01:26:55,409
The mother came in her skin

1278
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:59,926
Wow, what a misfortune my sister has come to bring the ghetto water

1279
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,830
Call your brother's ghetto

1280
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:03,950
Nasi Pashoo sister

1281
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:08,133
the doctor

1282
01:27:08,495 --> 01:27:12,335
Nothing, do not worry, you are worried

1283
01:27:13,405 --> 01:27:16,654
The mother who came in her skin is now in season

1284
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,634
I will give you a pill

1285
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,361
Do you have the right to visit your doctor?

1286
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:28,531
No, my mother should pray for me. In my mother's case, I do not get paid

1287
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:30,602
Say it with love

1288
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:31,842
Long live the mother goddess

1289
01:27:33,953 --> 01:27:34,579
بريم

1290
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:46,840
No my daughter, no one cares do not worry

1291
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:50,398
Everything is fine, calm down

1292
01:27:54,171 --> 01:27:55,126
Not two sticks

1293
01:27:56,642 --> 01:27:58,810
Two guns in front of the nose room ... then you

1294
01:28:00,618 --> 01:28:05,017
Look, Tircho .. How many clubs do we have and how many riflemen do we have?

1295
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:10,780
Ten batons and 5 riflemen Ten batons and 5 riflemen -

1296
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,979
Hey Ghetto, pay homage to Uncle Tircho

1297
01:28:13,723 --> 01:28:15,159
Be alive, my son

1298
01:28:16,644 --> 01:28:20,318
Tircho, the stick that everyone has, make 7 gunmen

1299
01:28:20,892 --> 01:28:26,211
Well, give me 2,000 rupees for the boys and 2,000 rupees for the gun

1300
01:28:28,523 --> 01:28:33,238
Prepaid and the rest after the wedding, but the guard is strict

1301
01:28:33,765 --> 01:28:36,307
Both for the nose and for the jadeo family

1302
01:28:37,533 --> 01:28:40,371
Do not worry about the court guard

1303
01:28:40,747 --> 01:28:41,546
Hello

1304
01:28:44,284 --> 01:28:45,322
Get the ghetto alive

1305
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:50,246
what happened?

1306
01:28:51,806 --> 01:28:54,397
You have a misunderstanding about the nose

1307
01:28:54,932 --> 01:28:56,069
nose?

1308
01:28:56,556 --> 01:28:59,678
What misunderstanding are they our daughter?

1309
01:28:59,972 --> 01:29:01,601
... Bora's uncles

1310
01:29:02,008 --> 01:29:04,827
Do not worry, Dapi has just come out of prison

1311
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,701
She is playing with her son, she is your friend, you go too

1312
01:29:16,749 --> 01:29:21,094
Babajan, my legs hurt

1313
01:29:22,693 --> 01:29:24,245
Do you marry outside the tribe?

1314
01:29:24,861 --> 01:29:27,372
How do you make yogurt if you mix water with milk?

1315
01:29:27,757 --> 01:29:29,373
Did you think about it?

1316
01:29:31,094 --> 01:29:32,518
..veto

1317
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:38,327
Bringing in the neighborhoods of Tircho?

1318
01:29:39,255 --> 01:29:43,995
Dapi dies of a wind blowing on himself

1319
01:29:44,351 --> 01:29:45,127
I know Uncle

1320
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:49,996
I came out of prison for a week, will I go on leave for sure?

1321
01:29:52,868 --> 01:29:57,019
You two are Jing Hamid's friends, aren't you? Like a flame movie

1322
01:29:58,108 --> 01:29:59,971
You and Bora ate together

1323
01:30:01,732 --> 01:30:04,301
Behold, I do not like to be an orphan

1324
01:30:04,786 --> 01:30:06,706
Tell Babat to stand back

1325
01:30:07,266 --> 01:30:09,807
..It's his uncle, did you understand? -

1326
01:30:10,401 --> 01:30:14,466
And where is the girl who caused the controversy?

1327
01:30:15,404 --> 01:30:16,588
Let's see the girl

1328
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:18,556
.. Uncle John Oun

1329
01:30:19,508 --> 01:30:21,508
Take me to the girl, otherwise I will steal and bring her

1330
01:30:22,106 --> 01:30:24,098
No, Uncle John, I'll show you

1331
01:30:29,515 --> 01:30:31,090
Bora, tell your father to solve the problem

1332
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:36,574
My brother went to my mother since I was a child and I have no connection with my father

1333
01:30:37,118 --> 01:30:40,116
I only saw him in prison two or three times! It is not clear how he got out

1334
01:30:43,117 --> 01:30:46,244
My little uncle ran away and married a girl

1335
01:30:46,836 --> 01:30:50,548
He buried it in front of my mother

1336
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:56,252
It is a normal honor killing for us ... if I say something

1337
01:30:56,764 --> 01:30:59,918
Honorable Mention Honor Murder Dishonesty is also a coincidence

1338
01:31:03,568 --> 01:31:08,283
I see three corpses of you, me and Bini .. There is also a fourth

1339
01:31:09,352 --> 01:31:10,440
Uncle Notal

1340
01:31:12,637 --> 01:31:17,075
What can I do now? Make it yourself

1341
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,108
At least save your father

1342
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:30,876
Look, Monga, in difficult times, no one is the president or the vice president

1343
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,068
We all fight together

1344
01:31:33,933 --> 01:31:36,751
Accept this, but we have not killed a single fly to date

1345
01:31:37,174 --> 01:31:39,246
And they are accused of 100 murders right now

1346
01:31:39,478 --> 01:31:45,010
Well, we have to start somewhere, the first murder, the second dimension, the third dimension

1347
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:46,035
Dad say -

1348
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:47,877
Hi Uncle

1349
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:49,858
what happened? I have a cartoon moment -

1350
01:31:56,972 --> 01:31:57,788
What?

1351
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:04,932
Now I'm coming from Dapi's house, he said he will kill you, you are my only father

1352
01:32:05,724 --> 01:32:08,139
Do you like me as an orphan and a widowed mother?

1353
01:32:10,284 --> 01:32:11,732
You have never slapped anyone

1354
01:32:12,348 --> 01:32:15,148
Why are you talking about giving blood, please, Dad?

1355
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,428
come

1356
01:32:24,556 --> 01:32:25,212
what is this?

1357
01:32:25,887 --> 01:32:26,580
..this

1358
01:32:26,827 --> 01:32:30,424
The White House, the home of the President of the United States

1359
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:36,449
I want to be president, not vice president

1360
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,824
Who remembers the vice president? No one

1361
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:43,280
The lemon with which they cook hot chicken

1362
01:32:44,064 --> 01:32:47,464
Nobody mentions it, everyone mentions chickens

1363
01:32:48,755 --> 01:32:49,664
Who am I?

1364
01:32:50,664 --> 01:32:56,811
نوتیال؟ I'm a lemon and I want to be a chicken-

1365
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,588
There is nothing better for a chicken than war

1366
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,868
..That is to make the war bigger and smaller

1367
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:11,854
Give them a war whenever the nation gets bored

1368
01:33:12,426 --> 01:33:14,890
From that war a new leader is born

1369
01:33:15,946 --> 01:33:19,570
After the war, no one could stop me from becoming the head of the neighborhood

1370
01:33:21,267 --> 01:33:24,547
And you were scared of a threat, little Notil?

1371
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:27,938
Are you surprised?

1372
01:33:28,578 --> 01:33:32,129
But we also created a controversial college course

1373
01:33:33,943 --> 01:33:40,448
We closed the whole city with a nationwide strike

1374
01:33:42,364 --> 01:33:47,608
So do not be afraid and continue your friendship with him

1375
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:52,112
Because the presence of a secret spy in the enemy's tent is very necessary

1376
01:33:53,632 --> 01:33:56,624
Tell me whatever happens there

1377
01:33:58,568 --> 01:33:59,344
مونگاجي

1378
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,263
Han is beautiful, but expensive, not mom?

1379
01:34:05,563 --> 01:34:07,453
Are you going to pay for it? Cutter

1380
01:34:08,117 --> 01:34:08,973
..this

1381
01:34:09,786 --> 01:34:11,626
this? I think expensive

1382
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,288
Hello Uncle Ghetto-

1383
01:34:22,021 --> 01:34:26,946
Hello مUncle ‌ Please see it from a distance today if possible

1384
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:32,252
Go away ... why from afar? I want to see close-ups

1385
01:34:33,059 --> 01:34:37,187
One more thing, if I like the girl, accept it

1386
01:34:37,659 --> 01:34:38,891
Otherwise the wedding is canceled

1387
01:34:39,188 --> 01:34:40,716
Loving Bora has no effect

1388
01:34:41,328 --> 01:34:43,902
... Okay, uncles, if you talk too much, shut up -

1389
01:34:46,012 --> 01:34:48,630
Which girl? Is this

1390
01:34:49,408 --> 01:34:51,030
No uncles here

1391
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,038
Which one? Where?

1392
01:34:54,252 --> 01:34:55,139
They are uncle

1393
01:34:55,525 --> 01:34:57,660
Where? She is in a yellow dress -

1394
01:34:58,123 --> 01:35:04,420
Yellow? This girl? Is this a girl?

1395
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:09,053
Is that so cute?

1396
01:35:09,735 --> 01:35:12,614
The lover of such a girl must have four or five murders for her

1397
01:35:13,597 --> 01:35:15,797
Tell the truth or you will be killed

1398
01:35:16,772 --> 01:35:20,372
Does this girl really like Bora? Han?

1399
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:26,086
I had heard that diamonds are found in the middle of charcoal

1400
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:29,078
But how did this diamond fall in love with my charcoal?

1401
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:30,733
What is the flow?

1402
01:35:32,198 --> 01:35:33,598
I greet my bride now and come

1403
01:35:33,966 --> 01:35:35,017
No, uncle, I pray for him -

1404
01:35:35,385 --> 01:35:38,593
Uncles now no

1405
01:35:39,128 --> 01:35:40,778
The first time I saw him, I had to give him something

1406
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:41,814
Omujan

1407
01:35:42,066 --> 01:35:45,977
How about not meeting the bride? Uncles are a matter of family reputation -

1408
01:35:46,845 --> 01:35:49,175
Well, give it to him, brother

1409
01:35:51,949 --> 01:35:53,437
Be sure to give it to my bride

1410
01:35:54,062 --> 01:35:55,142
Ok uncle

1411
01:36:05,424 --> 01:36:07,208
I have a nose for two minutes

1412
01:36:10,256 --> 01:36:16,159
Failed Uncle Notial Boy Do not follow me, you are unemployed

1413
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:20,919
Spread syrup on your bride and move the chair

1414
01:36:22,383 --> 01:36:22,995
nose

1415
01:36:23,304 --> 01:36:24,160
Please Go

1416
01:36:25,464 --> 01:36:26,776
Mom, this one is good, isn't it?

1417
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:31,160
"Beno Khal is beautiful on the forehead"

1418
01:36:33,056 --> 01:36:41,101
"Beno Bindiat is beautiful"

1419
01:36:43,074 --> 01:36:45,131
Answer my phone

1420
01:36:45,482 --> 01:36:46,415
I'm coming

1421
01:36:46,795 --> 01:36:49,885
Ghetto brother, please answer the nose phone

1422
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:03,661
Aloo Han Rahul

1423
01:37:04,933 --> 01:37:08,215
"Where are you? Come to me to find out where I am."

1424
01:37:08,452 --> 01:37:10,624
Tell me the truth, did you buy it?

1425
01:37:11,681 --> 01:37:12,289
Yeah

1426
01:37:12,905 --> 01:37:14,064
Well send a photo

1427
01:37:14,513 --> 01:37:15,097
What photo?

1428
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,745
Photo of clothes

1429
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:22,093
Oh well, but you do not give us a kiss?

1430
01:37:22,455 --> 01:37:23,404
How are you here?

1431
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:27,709
If you are new to France, you must love French

1432
01:37:29,692 --> 01:37:31,406
Won't you make such a small request?

1433
01:37:31,941 --> 01:37:35,799
Now no, make a list of them

1434
01:37:36,387 --> 01:37:40,348
You see, my list goes on and on and on

1435
01:37:40,611 --> 01:37:41,255
No

1436
01:38:03,999 --> 01:38:06,263
Ghetto; what happened?

1437
01:38:06,943 --> 01:38:09,319
What happened to the ghetto?

1438
01:38:11,863 --> 01:38:12,599
Did you bring a weapon?

1439
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:14,716
I brought it but chatted Yahoo?

1440
01:38:15,096 --> 01:38:19,879
You were right that day, we have to kill this path

1441
01:38:23,519 --> 01:38:25,687
You just talk, give me the gun

1442
01:38:26,459 --> 01:38:32,651
Come and get it, but nothing happened by killing Rahul

1443
01:38:34,355 --> 01:38:38,651
Nini's sister's wedding is not with Rahul, now her wedding is with me

1444
01:38:40,401 --> 01:38:43,241
Why did you show my nose to my father?

1445
01:38:44,566 --> 01:38:47,927
He even went crazy and chose the name of my children

1446
01:38:48,685 --> 01:38:51,037
Granddaughter of Dapi Dada Pepi

1447
01:38:54,909 --> 01:38:58,716
He sent Uncle Vijander to take a nap

1448
01:39:00,957 --> 01:39:05,021
Brother, the end of this riot is happening to me

1449
01:39:05,949 --> 01:39:07,061
The gun is in your hand .. hit me

1450
01:39:07,455 --> 01:39:08,240
No Bora

1451
01:39:08,544 --> 01:39:16,143
what's going on with you? Only you, my friend

1452
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:27,386
Ghetto, I have to remember this calamity

1453
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:30,665
You mean, like, all the bridesmaids except me?

1454
01:39:37,678 --> 01:39:43,465
Bini says I lie and put everyone to work?

1455
01:39:46,041 --> 01:39:51,169
Now look in front of his eyes to fool everyone

1456
01:39:51,721 --> 01:39:54,049
Remember him as long as he lives

1457
01:39:54,385 --> 01:39:59,573
Bora's wedding with the vision of this God can not change

1458
01:40:01,147 --> 01:40:03,867
And Dapi does not forget disrespect

1459
01:40:04,251 --> 01:40:06,603
One of the women in your area attacked her with slippers

1460
01:40:06,987 --> 01:40:10,611
And last night he was beaten like a dog

1461
01:40:12,739 --> 01:40:15,852
Why did your father become their leader?

1462
01:40:17,067 --> 01:40:22,026
The other father is dead, we must kill the father

1463
01:40:23,007 --> 01:40:25,896
I'm killing my dad's wedding morning, okay?

1464
01:40:26,391 --> 01:40:29,199
Okay, kill your uncle

1465
01:40:29,807 --> 01:40:33,192
But he sent this letter to Bora's father

1466
01:40:33,552 --> 01:40:36,015
Who is Baba Bora? Dad

1467
01:40:36,442 --> 01:40:37,333
I am the father

1468
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:41,878
My uncle reads it

1469
01:40:45,651 --> 01:40:48,569
Respectfully yours, Uncle John

1470
01:40:49,295 --> 01:40:51,655
Be alive

1471
01:40:52,235 --> 01:40:53,928
Uncle Vijander and Gojinder Hello

1472
01:40:54,359 --> 01:40:58,157
I'm fine here and I ask God for your health

1473
01:40:59,135 --> 01:41:02,646
At this moment, the brave, smart and reliable young man is just a ghetto

1474
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:08,222
After consulting with the ghetto, I came to the conclusion that Rito's wedding .. Rito is his older sister

1475
01:41:08,974 --> 01:41:14,116
After my sister's marriage, I run away and come to marry Bora

1476
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:15,588
it's true

1477
01:41:16,261 --> 01:41:22,108
You just have to be careful not to bleed

1478
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:26,741
He apologizes for beating Uncle Vijander

1479
01:41:27,452 --> 01:41:29,120
See your future bride

1480
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:38,616
Wow sweet letter written

1481
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:42,342
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange

1482
01:41:43,309 --> 01:41:45,999
Bora, your flag went up to me

1483
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,089
It sticks diamond and paper together

1484
01:41:51,678 --> 01:41:54,005
The girl is so beautiful .. I'm smart

1485
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:57,454
You see, we do what Bini suggested

1486
01:41:57,974 --> 01:41:58,630
Yes that's fine

1487
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:00,046
come here

1488
01:42:03,229 --> 01:42:07,640
You make Bora your real brother

1489
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:10,638
But Dapy's the groom's father

1490
01:42:11,142 --> 01:42:13,854
I said this is over

1491
01:42:15,328 --> 01:42:16,607
My uncles are just neighbors

1492
01:42:17,368 --> 01:42:18,829
Your real brother

1493
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,222
The angel of my nose

1494
01:42:23,046 --> 01:42:25,360
I will start with a poem, say guidance

1495
01:42:25,702 --> 01:42:26,174
guidance

1496
01:42:28,856 --> 01:42:30,014
I show the fire inside my heart to everyone

1497
01:42:30,614 --> 01:42:33,286
If your wedding dress gets up from Josh, I will set the world on fire

1498
01:42:35,961 --> 01:42:39,122
Luckily, your brother does not have a wife, because if he did

1499
01:42:40,975 --> 01:42:41,904
No .. Read

1500
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,737
Because if he was, the bride would be a widow

1501
01:42:47,888 --> 01:42:51,423
Do not be afraid of anyone, especially Baba Ghetto

1502
01:42:52,895 --> 01:42:55,856
My father has been carrying bullets in his gun for a long time

1503
01:42:57,263 --> 01:42:58,275
I told you

1504
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:04,681
My cute nightingale, tell someone who wants to stand between you and me

1505
01:43:05,114 --> 01:43:07,745
Even if they imprison you or close a wall in front of you

1506
01:43:08,007 --> 01:43:09,526
Bora and her family pulverize every wall

1507
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,997
And you can be stolen from that hellish cage at any moment

1508
01:43:15,277 --> 01:43:17,120
We have a person around us

1509
01:43:18,005 --> 01:43:21,668
Who will inform you in time that we are coming

1510
01:43:22,286 --> 01:43:22,966
Who?

1511
01:43:23,294 --> 01:43:23,878
I do not know

1512
01:43:25,701 --> 01:43:29,909
Lover displaced and dearer than Janet Bora

1513
01:43:32,012 --> 01:43:33,456
Telling me to give a tiger to the nose

1514
01:43:34,905 --> 01:43:37,411
I took a chance and brought it to you

1515
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:42,363
Nose is crazy, I'm afraid to run away from home

1516
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:43,900
Dadash for a moment

1517
01:43:44,666 --> 01:43:48,306
I die but I do not let my nose go out of the neighborhood; I am

1518
01:43:50,802 --> 01:43:52,057
Get in the ghetto and don't move

1519
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:56,121
He wants her to not even be able to talk to anyone on the phone

1520
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:57,235
ولي داداش

1521
01:43:57,595 --> 01:44:01,182
Shut up! What a pity for the wedding, otherwise I would have taken your account

1522
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:16,546
Dadash said

1523
01:44:29,177 --> 01:44:30,257
Turn off the light

1524
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:36,384
Turn off the light

1525
01:44:55,811 --> 01:44:57,990
Hello Ganj Free Police Station?

1526
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:06,202
For a moment, you did not fulfill your promises

1527
01:45:07,084 --> 01:45:09,891
A gunman with no truncheons

1528
01:45:10,368 --> 01:45:12,340
What are you saying do not worry

1529
01:45:12,716 --> 01:45:16,388
Ghetto, I told you to stay ahead

1530
01:45:17,214 --> 01:45:18,008
They are making up their noses

1531
01:45:18,317 --> 01:45:19,253
Well stay tuned please

1532
01:45:22,304 --> 01:45:24,984
The police came out

1533
01:45:25,475 --> 01:45:25,960
police?

1534
01:45:26,296 --> 01:45:27,456
police? ... A moment with me

1535
01:45:33,497 --> 01:45:34,208
What happened, sir?

1536
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:36,115
We had a general telephone threat. What is going on?

1537
01:45:36,458 --> 01:45:37,504
What happened, Captain?

1538
01:45:37,815 --> 01:45:40,527
They blow up the neighborhood with dynamite

1539
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,103
How do they explode?

1540
01:45:42,864 --> 01:45:45,104
This is a wedding, not a ridiculous game ... I'm them

1541
01:45:46,183 --> 01:45:47,568
I will solve it

1542
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:52,278
The police have arrived

1543
01:45:53,062 --> 01:45:54,246
When a girl gets married

1544
01:45:54,869 --> 01:45:57,646
Neighborhood lovers spread these rumors

1545
01:45:58,168 --> 01:46:01,008
See, what else do you want? What are you going to do to us?

1546
01:46:01,368 --> 01:46:02,600
... Brother, tell me what happened? I'm news

01:46:05,615 --> 01:46:07,175
Brother, talk, do not raise your hand

1549
01:46:07,638 --> 01:46:08,334
Why are you interfering?

1550
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:10,342
..I love him

1551
01:46:10,877 --> 01:46:12,766
Don't I like it? She is my sister

1552
01:46:15,942 --> 01:46:16,413
Brother

1553
01:46:17,061 --> 01:46:18,133

01:46:35,557 --> 01:46:36,730
Please go outside

1558
01:46:37,962 --> 01:46:38,698
What do you see?

This wedding is done in security

1562
01:46:56,809 --> 01:46:57,960
No you do not understand Uncle

1563
01:46:58,476 --> 01:47:01,044
All the games are played by the police

1564
01:47:01,597 --> 01:47:04,147
Dad, how are you with them?

What is it, brother?

1571
01:47:23,539 --> 01:47:25,480
Groom's convoy with the police

1572
01:47:25,815 --> 01:47:27,362

What are you saying bro?

1575
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:31,530
See Rahul

1576
01:47:31,826 --> 01:47:32,522
Ghetto

01:47:32,969 --> 01:47:36,905
Ghetto, this time there is no problem to make everything right

1578
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,617
I leave the reputation of the family to you

1579
01:47:40,569 --> 01:47:43,258
Take your sister to a place where no one knows

1580
01:47:43,681 --> 01:47:44,901
..But brother you do not know everything

1581
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:46,518

Please see

1583
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:50,294
Listen, say whatever the ghetto says, eyes

1584
01:47:51,734 --> 01:47:54,069
When it calms down here, I will call you back

1585
01:47:54,447 --> 01:47:56,941
Brother no please

1586
01:47:57,419 --> 01:47:58,160
بريم بیني

1587
01:48:20,227 --> 01:48:23,906
What do you do in the ghetto? Get me a ghetto

1588
01:48:24,344 --> 01:48:24,992
Where did you bring me?

1589
01:48:25,328 --> 01:48:25,825
See you with me

1590
01:48:26,176 --> 01:48:27,216
Ghetto, please leave me

1591
01:48:31,741 --> 01:48:34,540
Mahesh, Mahesh Pashu Yala

1592
01:48:35,276 --> 01:48:37,580
Take back your curse

1593
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:40,809
Did he get it? Take it back -

1594
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:55,226
Are you getting married or running away or getting married?

1595
01:48:56,115 --> 01:48:56,694
Stupid

1596
01:48:59,134 --> 01:49:01,286
Do not curse anyone from now on, sometimes it takes

1597
01:49:03,023 --> 01:49:04,783
Pour acid on my black tongue

1598
01:49:06,514 --> 01:49:08,919
His sermon held

1599
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:26,920
: Instagram and our official media telegram @BollyCineOfficial

1600
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:30,215
Do you have tea, brother?

1601
01:49:31,167 --> 01:49:32,263
We eat poison

1602
01:49:54,223 --> 01:49:59,110
You are so beautiful nose of this jewel of your nose

1603
01:50:10,215 --> 01:50:15,999
You must be surprised that you and I sat together

1604
01:50:18,686 --> 01:50:19,878
I was like that

1605
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:24,182
When your brother asked what is between Bini and Bora?

1606
01:50:26,485 --> 01:50:31,068
I thought the story would come together

1607
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:34,116
But see where he got to?

1608
01:50:37,948 --> 01:50:39,757
I should have told Dadasht

1609
01:50:43,208 --> 01:50:49,309
I agree, I'm not brave, but I love you very much

1610
01:50:52,012 --> 01:51:00,181
You have been sitting next to me since I was a child and now in a wedding dress, I am not a donkey

1611
01:51:03,733 --> 01:51:06,008
I will be brave like you

1612
01:51:13,084 --> 01:51:16,861
I know you will marry anyone in India today except me

1613
01:51:17,629 --> 01:51:19,501
..Everybody even sells tea

1614
01:51:21,781 --> 01:51:23,588
No, this tea sale, no

1615
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:30,108
You have to choose

1616
01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:35,464
Do you have an Eiffel or a cow? Or facing the house?

1617
01:51:38,836 --> 01:51:43,104
I admit I made a mistake, but do not punish me like this

1618
01:51:49,874 --> 01:51:52,836
Do your thoughts beautifully, I'm not in a hurry

1619
01:51:59,697 --> 01:52:00,689
Dear Uncle

1620
01:52:01,009 --> 01:52:03,356
You arrived in the middle of our wedding

1621
01:52:03,889 --> 01:52:06,058
No, no, my uncle, is my engine broken?

1622
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:09,236
Is your engine broken? Where are you now?

1623
01:52:09,817 --> 01:52:11,282
I sat in Fountain Park

1624
01:52:11,688 --> 01:52:14,208
You stay there with our bride

1625
01:52:16,277 --> 01:52:20,228

... your desired subscriber

1627
01:52:40,557 --> 01:52:43,620
The subscriber you want is not available

1628
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:54,413
Dada, we did not visit the whole park

1629
01:52:54,733 --> 01:52:55,556
So where to go?

1630
01:52:55,925 --> 01:52:58,804

1631
01:53:01,683 --> 01:53:06,316

It became a criminal matter

1637
01:53:20,708 --> 01:53:25,613
Our bride was taken hostage by her family ... and that poor ghetto too

1638
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:32,317
Uncles, we have a problem, the ghetto phone is off

01:55:23,946 --> 01:55:25,210
Is there a court for this?
