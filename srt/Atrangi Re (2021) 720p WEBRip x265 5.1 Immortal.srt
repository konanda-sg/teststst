1
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,708
Hey, first ask me
how I am.

2
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,416
Let it be.
Eat or you'll be hungry.

3
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,125
Who are you?
Why have you kidnapped me?

4
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,791
What do you want?
I don't have any money.

5
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,791
Who are you? What do you want?

6
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,807
Why did you kidnap me? Let me go.

7
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,333
What's going on?
Will I be sacrificed in a ritual?

8
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,791
I'm a journalist.

9
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,921
If my friends find out,
they'll come after you.

10
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,921
Untie me!

11
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,260
Untie me right now.
Untie me now, come on.

12
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,666
You look like a good person.
Please untie me.

13
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,250
Tell them to let me go.

14
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,000
What are you doing?

15
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,625
Will you kill me now?
Bring that cylinder here!

16
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,875
Untie me.

17
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Did you steal my kidneys?

18
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,150
What have you done?

19
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,692
You don't approve
of the marriage?

20
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:44,817
They forced me to marry..

21
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:01,275
She doesn't listen anyway.
Now all hell will break loose.

22
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,525
Vishu, come here quickly!

23
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:33,484
This is too tight, Mother.

24
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:46,655
Give me a minute!

25
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:10,436
Don't shout, Mandy!
Listen to me, for God's sake.

26
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,727
Please, it's not what you think.

27
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:14,227
What am I supposed to think?

28
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:16,602
What? What's the problem?

29
00:46:16,894 --> 00:46:18,727
Mandy, listen... Mandy!

30
00:46:21,104 --> 00:46:23,229
Look at this, uncle.
Look at your son.

31
00:46:23,687 --> 00:46:24,854
Are you aware of what he has done?

32
00:46:24,979 --> 00:46:26,396
Mandy, please listen to me.

33
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:29,396
He is married
to that girl over there.

34
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:32,677
And now he's pretending
like nothing has happened

35
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:36,484
and is enjoying her performance.

36
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,584
It's not what you think!
I'll explain everything..

37
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:39,403
Don't talk anything!

38
00:46:39,437 --> 00:46:41,396
What? What happened?

39
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:43,146
Daddy!

40
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:45,187
What happened, my child?

41
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:46,646
Vishu, what's going on?

42
00:46:46,855 --> 00:46:48,272
Mother, they kidnapped me.

43
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:51,040
I was unconscious.

44
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:54,607
Is this a joke?

45
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,317
We can talk about this.

46
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:58,520
How dare you!

47
00:46:58,812 --> 00:47:01,229
Listen to me, for god's sake!

48
00:47:01,396 --> 00:47:03,021
Move aside, Mother.
We'll talk about it later.

49
00:47:03,146 --> 00:47:07,062
You've married that girl;
now you dare to bring her here?

50
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:14,086
It's not what you think.
Not what you think!

51
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:17,062
I'll make sure
you don't get your degree!

52
00:47:17,187 --> 00:47:18,859
Just get out of here.

53
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:37,771
Everything is over!
What is left to discuss?

54
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:54,270
Let go of her hand.

55
00:48:58,062 --> 00:48:59,437
Let go of her hand.

56
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:34,146
Are you waiting
for them to call the police?

57
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:13,296
You should treat all girls
the way you treat your daughter.

58
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:51,896
I'm not upset that
the wedding got called off.

59
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:55,193
I'm angry
because I'm not upset at all!

60
00:53:58,187 --> 00:54:00,564
Everything was going smoothly.

61
00:54:02,396 --> 00:54:05,646
Clear the medical exam at 24,
become a doctor at 28.

62
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:09,109
Get married at 32,
buy a house at 35.

63
00:54:09,437 --> 00:54:11,746
Be a good son to my parents.

64
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:15,120
Everything has suddenly changed.

65
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:18,398
You have changed everything.

66
00:54:19,479 --> 00:54:21,984
I have never felt this way before
like I do now.

67
00:54:22,104 --> 00:54:24,166
Never cried like a fool...

68
00:54:24,396 --> 00:54:26,424
like I'm crying now.

69
00:54:27,812 --> 00:54:31,054
You'll soon leave with
your boyfriend. What will I do then?

70
00:54:32,146 --> 00:54:34,729
Thinking of this makes me upset.

71
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,630
I shouldn't be upset, right?

72
00:54:36,854 --> 00:54:39,465
You get what I'm trying to tell you,
don't you?

73
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:42,457
Why did you have to come
into my life, Rinku?

74
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,771
Why?

75
00:54:44,896 --> 00:54:48,062
You belong to someone else,
then why...

76
00:54:48,812 --> 00:54:51,693
I'm not angry that
the wedding got called off.

77
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:54,019
I'm falling for you.

78
00:54:56,687 --> 00:55:00,203
I don't know what to do,
and this is driving me mad.
