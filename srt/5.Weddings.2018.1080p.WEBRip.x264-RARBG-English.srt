like a week, two, tops?

182
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,345
[chuckles] Use repellent, woman!

183
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,865
I mean I guess we're taking
orders from Alexa now!

184
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:28,904
Hey, go where your dad is from.

185
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,112
Remember he used to tell you

186
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:31,734
about all the places
in his village?

187
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:34,530
[melancholy music]
- [sighs] Yeah.

188
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,947
- Look, Harbhajan.

189
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,330
I'm sensitive to your problem.

190
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:43,470
I really am!

191
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:44,816
Your father was my friend.

192
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:46,818
He was India's hero.

193
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:52,341
- Exactly the reason I shouldn't
be doing old folks patrol.

194
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:57,001
Sir, I know you give me all
these non-risk assignments

195
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:57,898
because of Mummy Ji.

196
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:01,453
But this is not the reason
why I joined the police.

197
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,352
It's a big problem for me.

198
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,354
[sighs]

199
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:11,498
She lost everything when
your dad was killed!

200
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:13,465
- I understand.

201
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,296
I know she's scared
she'll lose me, too.

202
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:19,609
But life is not risk-averse.

203
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:24,166
You know what, that old
biji, she's going to kill me

204
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,996
one of these days with
her stupid jiu jitsu!

205
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:29,550
[chuckles]

206
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:32,277
Seriously, sir, I need
something more meaningful.

207
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:33,796
- [sighs] Harb.

208
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:37,213
[groans]

209
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,252
How to make your mom
and you happy, eh?

210
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,430
Hmm.

211
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,265
Yeah.

212
00:11:56,612 --> 00:11:58,890
A journalist from Sterling
Magazine in America

213
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:01,272
has filed visa application,

214
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,067
through the Ministry
of Information.

215
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,760
I know it's not
terrorist with guns

216
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:10,315
but these foreign journalists
can create enough problems

217
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,282
with the balance.

218
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:14,319
They all think they
are going to uncover

219
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:16,666
some big human rights drama,

220
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,841
when they have got plenty
of human rights drama

221
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,326
in their own backyard!

222
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:22,811
Ministry wants her monitored.

223
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:27,988
- Yeah, so what do
you want me to do?

224
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:30,646
- Escort her, be
her liaison officer!

225
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,717
She's coming here to
photograph wedding

226
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,098
and interview brides.

227
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,478
- How hard-hitting.

228
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,273
- One overzealous journalist,

229
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,690
and India's reputation
is at stake.

230
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:41,519
- These are weddings, sir.

231
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,762
Punjabi weddings.

232
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,625
The only reputation
which is at stake

233
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,181
are actually these
intoxicated baratis.

234
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:50,666
- [chuckles] Harb,
let's keep it that way!

235
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,186
Just make sure she's staying
within her approvals.

236
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,156
Keep me updated if she deviates
from her research, hmm?

237
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,503
- Does that also
include color patterns

238
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:02,195
and floral arrangements?

239
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:03,472
- Sarcasm aside,

240
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,788
Harb, this is an
important assignment.

241
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,997
Or you can go back to
checking on the seniors!

242
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,104
[soft knocking]

243
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,623
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey!

244
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,385
- How are you?

245
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,318
- It's been a long time
since you were in India.

246
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,182
- Oh, and that's
the way I'd like it!

247
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:30,533
- For sleeping on the plane.

248
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:32,052
[laughs] Oh, I couldn't help it!

249
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:32,915
Can't help it!

250
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,434
Okay,

251
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:35,159
-Hilarious

252
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:36,574
after the sucker punch!

253
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,438
- Okay.

254
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,509
- Hysterical Love.

255
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,305
- Alright, okay, thank you!

256
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,619
- What are you doing
with my old shirts?

257
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:48,551
- Oh!

258
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:49,794
I just wanted to look the part!

259
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:51,900
Namaste!

260
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:53,936
- Aww.

261
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:56,836
These were great times.

262
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,771
- What, you got me
a goodbye present?

263
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,014
I mean, I'm in and I'm out, Ma.

264
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,671
Look at the size of my suitcase.

265
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:09,710
- No, this is a present
for someone else in India.

266
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:12,644
- Who?

267
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:17,546
Corner of Rose Garden,
Old Chandigarh, India?

268
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,755
How the heck am I
supposed to find this?

269
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:21,999
- [Mom] I'm sure
there's an app for it.

270
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:25,312
- [laughs] Mom, I'm not FedEx!

271
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,452
- No, of course not,
you're much prettier.

272
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,666
This is for your father.

273
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:37,221
- What?

274
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,535
We haven't spoken to
Dad since I was six.

275
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,985
And now we're exchanging gifts?

276
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,298
- It's the picture you
snuck out of his suitcase

277
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:46,816
when he left for India.

278
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,198
And some other pictures of
you, I want him to have them.

279
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:52,926
- Mom,

280
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,031
no, why?

281
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,689
- Because he asked
for them many times

282
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:00,278
and I was too
angry to send them.

283
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:01,210
- Wait.

284
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:02,936
You've been in touch with him?

285
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,489
- Sort of.

286
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:07,665
He called, I hung up, he left
messages, I deleted them.

287
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,771
It took me a long time
to get over the fact

288
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:12,946
that he left just because--
- Mama.

289
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,361
We've been over this.

290
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,260
- And I know that now!

291
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:17,606
[Shania sighs]

292
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,090
But, Shania, he's a good man.

293
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,922
- A good man would not
leave his family for that.

294
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:28,375
- Look, he tried to make
it right in so many ways

295
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,480
but I didn't let him.

296
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:34,071
[sighs] But his last
message was different.

297
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:36,073
He sounded very sad.

298
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:41,526
I've forgiven him and I think
you should try, too, as well.

299
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,431
I didn't pack this one but I
think you should have it, too.

300
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:56,679
- [sighs] Oh, yay,
happily ever after.

301
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,959
Fine.

302
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,892
[melancholy music]

303
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:15,388
[plane zooms]

304
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:18,874
- [Woman On PA] Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to India.

305
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:21,049
We have landed at
Chandigarh Airport.

306
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,810
I hope you've enjoyed your
flight from New York to Delhi

307
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:26,123
and we look forward to
serving you in the future.

308
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:31,645
- [Man On PA] Ladies
and gentlemen,

309
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,648
the flight from Beijing has
landed at New Delhi Airport.

310
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:38,790
You may collect your
bags at Baggage Claim...

[upbeat Indian music]

312
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,665
[loud squeal]

313
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,528
- What the heck?

314
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,186
I knew I shouldn't have come

315
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,670
to this stupid, stupid country!

316
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,847
Excuse me, sir?

317
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,159
Mister?

318
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,367
Officer!

319
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:06,059
I was attacked by those people!

320
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:07,164
Unprovoked, attacked!

321
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:09,304
You should find them!

322
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:10,132
You know find?

323
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,755
Do you speak English?

324
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,068
- Find them for what?

325
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:16,621
To make your clothes
more colorful?

326
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:17,484
- What?

327
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:21,454
It's Holi, ma'am.

328
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:22,972
Festival of Color.

329
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,457
It happens every year.

330
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:26,183
They're not going to stop
for your arrival, you know.

331
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,601
- Oh, hey!

332
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:33,224
Hi, are you my liaison officer?

333
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,019
- You are from
Sterling Magazine?

334
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,227
- Yes, yes!

335
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:37,987
- I'm your tip top
driver, Donald!

336
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,713
Follow me, Madamji, come!
- Okay.

337
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:41,819
- Come this side!

338
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,441
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

339
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:48,136
I was told you're here
to cover weddings.

340
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,827
And maybe to reconnect
with your Indian roots?

341
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,725
- [scoffs] Well,
you were told wrong.

342
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,281
Wait, why are you following me?

343
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:58,594
- Sad as it is for both of
us, I'm not following you,

344
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,526
I'm with you.

345
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,390
- What is that supposed to mean?

346
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:04,773
- I'm Officer Harbhajan
Singh, your liaison officer.

347
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,844
And I can protect you
from those vicious locals

348
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,294
while you're here in India.

349
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,606
- [scoffs] And doing such
a fabulous job of it!

350
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,298
Somebody give this man a raise!

351
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:17,372
[upbeat Indian music]

352
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:33,284
- No, thank you.

353
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,253
In India, we stick
to the basics.

354
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,013
You know, good
old-fashioned soap.

355
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:43,432
- Basics, huh?

356
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,263
How's that workin' out for ya?

357
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,201
I'm sorry, that was really mean.

358
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,168
I shouldn't have said that.

359
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,135
You know what?

360
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,860
The airport was
actually really nice!

361

- Come, Ms. Dhaliwal.

362
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,798
I'm so glad we did not
disappoint you on all levels.

363
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,661
Thank you.

364
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:10,321
See?

Over there, cow!

366

Beautiful, no?

367
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,223
- Yeah,
- Probably 'cause

368
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,156
that's what you think
India's all about!

369
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,502
Right?

370
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,365
- No.

371
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:20,366
No one ever said that.

372
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:25,819
Actually, India's changed a
lot since I've been here last.

373
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:27,511
- India is not a
village anymore.

374
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:30,859
- Yeah, I've noticed!
- In case you were wondering.

375
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:31,722
- I see!

376
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,969
Look there, that's like
a family of five there!

I don't see five.

- [Shania] So, Donald, is it?

384
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:57,230
Sounds almost American.

385
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:59,370
- It is American, Madamji!

386
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:00,923
I like America!

387

be American someday!

Do you know, Madamji, my
name is Tanweer Singh.

But I call myself Donald!

390

391

lottery nine times!

393
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:18,389
As my mother used to say,

394
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:21,668
if you think positive,
it will happen!

395
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:25,258
One day, I will be in New
York, the Giant Apple!

396
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:26,915
- Oh no, it's Big Apple.

397

- The size does not
matter, Madamji!

398
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:34,163
But first, I must meet
American woman of my dreams!

Done.

Five minutes.

416
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:13,306

[speaking in foreign language]

418
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:22,108
Sirji wanted to take you in
gurdwara as a welcome to India!

419
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,145
- You can't be so afraid
of a bitty spider!

420
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,216
- I told you, I'm arachnophobic!

421
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:29,667
- Arachna-what?

422
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,980
- Afraid of spiders, Daddy!

423
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:35,017
- Where do you learn such
silly American words?

424
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:36,467
- Stop, that tickles!

425
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,745
- But I'm a tiny spider
biting your neck!

426
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,265
- [laughs] Mom, Dad's
making fun of my disability!

427

You're a Sikh!

I'm a princess!

interested, Madamji?

In what?

437
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:07,118
- Arranging my marriage
to an American lady!

438
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,741
- Oh!

439
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:09,983
We don't do that in America.

440
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,744
We don't have
arranged marriages.

441
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:13,608
- Yes, Madamji, they do!

442
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:16,783

It doesn't matter.

I don't know much
about those sites.

447
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:28,277
I don't ever wanna get married.

448

you're not even in India.

Alright.

and don't let the bed bugs bite!

460
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,420
- Wait, there are bugs?

461
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,321
Hey, so I just got to the hotel.

It's lovely!

Outside, a little
bit of everything.

Dirt poor, filthy rich.

00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:19,639
I got a list of weddings here.

Quick question, who do
you want me to cover?

- [Claudia Voiceover]
Well, thanks to Hollywood,

00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:27,440
we've seen slumdogs
and millionaires.

Why don't you cover
the real India?

The one in between?

471
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,583

Stuck on work again?

Just like your father.

- An American girl.
- Mm!

American attacked a Sikh,

484

No concept of other
culture, these Americans!

485
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:15,626
- I'm sure not all of
them are like that, hmm?

486
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,732

turban and they think

there is a bomb in it!

so much about Americans?

You've never even
been to America.

00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:56,649
He's stuck in Delhi and
can't get on his flight.

538
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:57,616
- This can't be happening!

539
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,031
I need another photographer!

550
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:17,359
The driver could give me
a photographer for today

551
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:19,707
but you have to get me another
one for the next wedding.

564

Actually they are just
pretending to talk on the phone.

565
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,611
Nobody's talking to anyone.

566

I wanna do an editorial on them.

00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,541
- I'm not really sure, but
I think I'm onto something.

689
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,750
I'm sure they don't want me
to know about this story.

like an Editor-In-Chief!

what happened to Harbhajan?

00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,939
- I don't know, Madamji.

1072
00:53:38,974 --> 00:53:42,080
Sirji said he's taking
himself off the assignment.

1073

Are you okay, Madamji?

1074

- Of course.

1075

Why wouldn't I be?

I mean, he's a grown man, he
could do what he wants, right?

1077

Besides, Chahel
seems way more fun.

she can break the rules
or do whatever she wants?

by that text you sent?

to stay focused.

Punjabi word for reception.

01:03:20,106 --> 01:03:21,590
- Yeah! [laughs]

1242
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:24,317
Shaniaji, you know what,
when we both get married,

1243
01:03:24,352 --> 01:03:26,837
you have to be the
bride's friend, hmm?

1244
01:03:26,872 --> 01:03:27,942
- Bride's friend.

1245
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:29,806
The bridesmaid, yes.
- See you!

1246
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,807
- She's funny, come!

1247
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:32,291
- Very funny.
- Let's enjoy.

1248
01:03:32,325 --> 01:03:33,188
- Testing, testing.

1249
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:34,155
Hanji, hanji!

1250
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:37,089
[loud thuds]
Hello, hello.

1251
01:03:37,123 --> 01:03:40,299
[upbeat Indian music]

1252
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,343
- [Harbhajan] Cookies and
Cream getting married.

1253
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:35,448
[chuckles] Amazing.

1254
01:05:35,483 --> 01:05:37,347
Well, there's your fifth
wedding.

1255
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:38,935
- [Shania] Yeah.

1256
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,798
- Come on, you should
be over the moon now.

1257
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:53,570
- I have to get this
package to my dad

1258
01:05:53,604 --> 01:05:56,090
but I have no idea how to
find this crazy address.

1259
01:06:02,613 --> 01:06:04,512
- Your dad's in Chandigarh?

1260
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:05,720
- Yeah.

1261
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:06,652
It's a long story.

1262
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,758
It's time to write
the next chapter.

1263
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:12,485
Will you help me?

1264
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,384
[car horn beeps]

1265
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:17,145
- [chuckles] We're
not even dating

1266
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,698
and I get to meet your father.

1267
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:22,461
[chuckles]

1268
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:24,808
Are we ready for that?

1269
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:30,055
[relaxing Indian music]

1270
01:07:10,992 --> 01:07:12,200
- [Shania] Oh, my God.

1271
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:13,822
I wonder if he'll
even recognize me.

1272
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,309
Harb, I can't do this!

1273
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:19,863
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, my gosh!

1274

1280
01:08:17,231 --> 01:08:18,301
- Hey, I'm...

1281
01:08:19,647 --> 01:08:20,475
I'm sorry.

1282
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,617
I know how it feels.

1283
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:28,725
I've been there.

1284
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:30,761
[sighs]

1285
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:43,774
[wistful Indian music]

1286
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:20,017
- [Little Shania] Daddy,
what happens when you die?

1287
01:09:20,052 --> 01:09:20,880
- Mm!

1288
01:09:21,743 --> 01:09:23,469
Well, we reincarnate!

1289
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:29,165
The soul comes back
as something different

1290
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,959
to be with who we love.

1291
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:33,341
- How do you know
the soul's back?

1292
01:09:33,376 --> 01:09:35,861
- If you look really
hard, you'll see it.

1293
01:09:35,895 --> 01:09:38,243
- When you die will
your soul come back?

1294
01:09:38,277 --> 01:09:41,315
- [laughs] Only for you!

1295
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:43,179
- What if I don't
look hard enough,

1296
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:45,146
then I won't know it's you.

1297
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,285
- Hmm.

1298
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,735
Tell you what.

1299
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:50,255
I'll come back as

1300
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:51,808
a pigeon!

1301
01:09:51,842 --> 01:09:53,361
- [Little Shania] A pigeon?

1302
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:58,401
- [Rajinder] Mm-hm.

1303
01:10:13,036 --> 01:10:14,762
- Here?

1304
01:10:14,796 --> 01:10:17,351
Better?
- Mm-hm.

1305
01:10:17,385 --> 01:10:20,630
[wistful Indian music]

1306
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:26,912
Wow.

1307
01:10:26,946 --> 01:10:28,672
Can't believe I'll
never see him again.

1308
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:36,922
Anyway, thank you
for bringing me.

1309
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:41,202
The priest said he
was cremated here.

1310

[birds squawking]
[Shania sighs]

1311
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:47,726
So this is where
it happens, huh?

1312
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:49,900
- Yes.

1313
01:10:49,935 --> 01:10:52,006
This is where the town
brings their dead.

1314
01:10:53,179 --> 01:10:53,939
Last rites.

1315
01:10:57,943 --> 01:10:58,840
They bring the dead bodies here

1316
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,048
and then just

1317
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:02,741
turn them into flames.

1318
01:11:03,776 --> 01:11:06,641
[melancholy music]

1319
01:11:08,194 --> 01:11:10,127
- You know, I always wonder

1320
01:11:12,613 --> 01:11:15,063
how people lose their
identities once they're dead.

1321
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,929
For everyone, you're,
you're just a body.

1322
01:11:24,349 --> 01:11:25,211
You know, I,

1323
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:28,801
I was sitting right there,
throughout.

1324
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:33,427
I didn't leave my dad alone.

1325
01:11:37,154 --> 01:11:38,155
Everybody else left.

1326
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,193
I was right there.

1327
01:11:45,266 --> 01:11:47,026
I'm sure he's always with me.

1328
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:52,308
- Dad said we'd come back
as an animal or as a human

1329
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:55,345
to catch up with who we love.

1330
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,660
[chuckles] He said he'd return
as a pigeon just to see me.

1331
01:12:04,941 --> 01:12:06,114
Look at all those birds.

1332
01:12:07,944 --> 01:12:09,842
I wonder if one of
them is a pigeon.

1333
01:12:13,018 --> 01:12:14,157
- It's not yours to find.

1334
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:16,159
It'll will find you.

1335
01:12:21,682 --> 01:12:23,166
[sighs] Come on now.

1336
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,306
I'm sure your dad wouldn't
wanna see you like this.

1337
01:12:26,169 --> 01:12:29,931
- Yeah, you're right.

1338
01:12:29,966 --> 01:12:30,760
- Come.

[car horn beeps loudly]

1341
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,854
[chuckles] You want
me to carry you again?

1342
01:12:55,888 --> 01:13:00,272
- I think I got this. [laughs]

So pretty.

1346
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:19,049
- It's Indian.

1347
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:24,020
- Wow.

1348
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:26,402
- Indian.

1349
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:32,718
Indian.

1350
01:13:33,788 --> 01:13:34,617
Very much Indian.

[speaks in foreign language]

1352
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:45,490
- I can't believe
how much it hurts.

1353
01:13:47,492 --> 01:13:52,497
- Yeah, I know.

1354
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:58,744
- Does it ever get better?

1355
01:14:02,714 --> 01:14:04,957
- I still see his face
sometimes.

1356
01:14:04,992 --> 01:14:06,890
I'm not sure if it
ever gets better.

1357
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,031
But I guess you accept it.

1358
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,621
Learn to live with the pain.

1359
01:14:21,284 --> 01:14:23,182
You know anything about physics?

1360
01:14:23,217 --> 01:14:24,218
- [Shania] Yeah, why?

1361
01:14:25,978 --> 01:14:26,979
- Energy never dies.

1362
01:14:28,153 --> 01:14:29,223
Merely changes forms.

1363
01:14:30,811 --> 01:14:31,915
And soul is an energy,

1364
01:14:33,296 --> 01:14:35,091
hence, it never dies.

health rating, a D minus?

1368
01:14:49,312 --> 01:14:51,003

being so American.

Sorry, I have to take this.

- Yes, sir.

1374

- Listen Harb hajan.

1375
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,496
You insisted on
taking care of this.

1376
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,084
Is the mission complete?

1377
01:15:37,118 --> 01:15:39,155
- Sir, I don't think she's
the problem

1378
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:40,018
you think with she is

1379

- [Avtar On Phone] Don't argue.

1380
01:15:41,295 --> 01:15:43,953
You're there to get
her laptop, that's it!

1381
01:15:43,987 --> 01:15:44,816
- Okay.

1382
01:15:46,611 --> 01:15:48,129
You'll have to
promise me one thing.

1383
01:15:48,164 --> 01:15:49,268
- [Avtar On Phone] Yeah.

1384
01:15:49,303 --> 01:15:51,408
- If I get you all the stuff,

1385
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:53,479
she'll be able to go back home.

1386
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:55,792

[siren wails]
[car horn beeps]

1388
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,495
- I felt his spirit
at the gurdwara.

1389
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:44,841
They said he came everyday.

1390
01:16:46,256 --> 01:16:49,432
I just wish he could have
seen me all grown up.

1391
01:16:49,466 --> 01:16:51,641
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1392
01:16:51,676 --> 01:16:52,849
- It's okay.

1393
01:16:52,884 --> 01:16:55,300
Anyway, how's your
manhunt goin'?

1394
01:16:55,334 --> 01:16:58,406
- [chuckles] My manhunt's
fine, how's your man hunk?

1395
01:16:58,441 --> 01:17:00,926
- [chuckles] He's
not a man hunk!

1396

- He is in picture 63!

1397
01:17:02,687 --> 01:17:03,342
- What?

1398
01:17:03,377 --> 01:17:04,481
What are you talking about?

1399
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:06,242
- Well, I think you guys
do make the cutest couple.

1400

- Oh, my goodness.

1401
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:08,693
Let me see.

1402
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:10,142
It's that one where you've got
that really gorgeous smile,

1403
01:17:10,177 --> 01:17:12,351
and he's kinda slightly flexing.

1404
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:14,664
Oh, my God, it's just so hot.

1405
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:15,596
- Oh, my God, it's gone!

1406
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,977
- What?

1407
01:17:17,011 --> 01:17:18,081
- [Shania] My laptop!

[melancholy music]

1409
01:17:27,919 --> 01:17:28,747

01:17:30,369 --> 01:17:31,750
Harbhajan?

1411
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,441
Dinner?

1412
01:17:33,476 --> 01:17:34,926
- Yeah, delicious, Mamaji.

1413
01:17:36,755 --> 01:17:38,757
- But you have to eat
it to know that.

[phone beeps]

1416
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:48,491
Maybe it's important.

1417

Thank you so much.

You can't publish this

Oh, I get it.

who took my computer

because you don't want
me to write this article.
