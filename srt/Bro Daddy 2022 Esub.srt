1
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:10,736
"They don't look like they're old
enough to get married, right?"

2
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:16,744
"Hey... has Pappachan's daughter
really turned 18?"

3
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:44,333
"What a throw and that too
with your tilted shoulder, <i>ichaya</i>!"

4
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:12,126
"Oh, wow! They've been married
only for four months, right?"

5
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:20,883
"He is Mr. Chacko's son after all...
Ha-ha-ha!"

6
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,536
"Just wait till I start crawling.
I'll turn your world upside down!"

7
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,956
"Oh, <i>Eesho</i>! Who wrecked this place?"
[EESHO = JESUS]

8
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,432
"It's Eesho indeed!"

9
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:04,153
"I am... Eesho... He-he-he!"

10
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:08,668
"Dad... I'll go forward...
Just pass it back to me..."

11
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:17,396
"Don't think you're better than me,
<i>mone Dinesha</i>..."

12
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,500
"Dad?"

13
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:28,092
"You have to bring either your father
or your mother for the PTA meeting,"

14
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,061
"not your sister."

15
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:35,599
"Sigh... This principal
is so funny... He-he-he..."

16
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:41,203
"This is not my sister.
She's my mother..."

17
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,809
"Happy 25th anniversary, darling..."

18
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,640
"You look so handsome
in this <i>kurta, ichaya</i>..."

19
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:09,204
"Do you two really have to flirt
right in front of me?"

20
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,124
As we all know,

21
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,033
this is the first time that a building

22
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:06,494
is being demolished through
a bomb explosion in Kerala.

23
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,061
There will be three sirens in total,

24
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:11,539
and the first two sirens
have blown already.

25
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,304
There will be one more siren.

26
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,726
As we're already aware,

27
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:18,748
1,312 perforations have been made
in this apartment building.

28
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:21,549
Explosive materials have been loaded
into all those perforations.

29
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,354
As the third siren blows,

30
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:25,562
the countdown will appear
on my right side.

31
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,659
I mean,
on the right side of the screen.

32
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:30,518
The third siren
has been sounded now.

33
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:32,057
The countdown has started!

34
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,862
Nine seconds to go.
Eight seconds...

35
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,127
Seven seconds...
Six more seconds to go.

36
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:42,495
Any moment now, this skyscraper
you see behind me will be demolished.

37
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,082
The explosion has happened.

38
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,452
The building is falling!
The building is falling!

39
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:48,002
The building has... not... fallen!

40
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,284
Though the explosion happened,
the building has not fallen.

41
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:53,612
We need to find out what happened,
and the engineers are on their way.

42
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,838
Let's try asking them.

43
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,502
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

44
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:00,370
Sir! Sir! Sir!
What happened? What happened?

45
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:01,887
We cannot give
a clear answer now.

46
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:06,268
But it's only because this builder
used top-quality TMT steel bars

47
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,049
that nothing has happened
to this building.

48
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,541
This is our technical team's
initial inference.

49
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,956
Well, now we know the reason.
Anyway, whom do we blame for this?

50
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,987
The state government, the police...

51
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:17,291
or the fire force,

52
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,127
or the local ruling body?

53
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:20,526
Whom do we blame for this chaos?

54
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,299
You can blame anyone!

55
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:25,479
But you cannot blame the engineers
who built this apartment.

56
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:27,370
Because they have used.

57
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:32,409
ISI 550D certified
strong and sturdy TMT steel bars!

58
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,962
Kattadi TMT steel bars!

59
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,273
The one that doesn't sway
with the wind!

60
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,492
Very, very strong!

61
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:44,940
Father,

62
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,548
how's our new advertisement?

63
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,376
Nice. It's really good.

64
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:49,767
It's a great concept.

65
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,190
The concept is mine.

66
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:53,791
- And you know Kurian, right?
- Which Kurian?

67
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:56,213
- Malieakal Kurian!
- Oh, yeah!

68
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,261
- His advertising company shot this.
- Is it?

69
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,159
Anyway, it's a really creative idea.

70
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,799
The idea is mine!

71
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,197
Whosever it is, it is quite catchy.

72
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:07,051
It will play in theatres
next week onwards.

73
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:08,504
The crowd is going to erupt.
Wait and watch, Father!

74
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:10,648
So, you must have spent
a lot of money on this, right?

75
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:17,046
Father, the Kattadi company
was founded by my father,

76
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,960
Kattadi Chacko.

77
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:23,011
So, we didn't really bother
about the money with this one.

78
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,072
Yes! You should never bother
about money for such things.

79
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:35,716
- I spent close to Rs. 25 lakh.
- Good, good.

80
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:37,344
Coffee.

81
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:38,766
Father.

82
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:49,420
I have come here to talk
about two things mainly.

83
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,608
The construction of our new chapel
is going on.

84
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:55,280
So, I'm expecting a fair donation
of both steel bars and cash!

85
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:58,927
Father, you know what?

86
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:01,227
My business is going
through a dull phase.

87
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:03,992
I'm doing this advertisement
to get it up and running.

88
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:06,586
John, it is for <i>Eesho Mishiha</i>.
[JESUS CHRIST]

89
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:08,586
One should never cut corners
when it comes to Him.

90
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,507
My dear Eesho,
what's with this look?

91
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,993
With your long hair
and goatee beard,

92
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:16,704
are you out to fool people?

93
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,149
Look at how you've turned out!

94
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:20,687
You don't need your family
or your people.

95
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:23,140
- Is this how you talk to <i>Eesho</i>?
- Of course!

96
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:24,916
<i>Eesho</i> is our only...

97
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:25,963
He might be the only one,

98
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:27,812
but he definitely needs
a whack once in a while.

99
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,570
- Him and his damn Bangalore style!
- Yeah!

100
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:30,791
Huh?

101
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,768
Bangalore style?

102
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,540
For <i>Eesho</i>?

103
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,086
Oh, God!

104
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:46,766
Oh, you were talking to him!

105
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,523
It is Dr. Samuel's
daughter's wedding today.

106
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:57,483
He will come wearing those ear-studs
and a tie-dyed shirt.

107
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:58,555
I am sure!

108
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,292
- Annamma!
- Yeah?

109
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,330
Can you get me a coffee?
Make it really frothy.

110
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:06,640
Hi, Father!

111
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:08,679
Eesho!

112
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,116
Eesho John Kattadi.

113
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,899
You haven't seen him, right?

114
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:14,174
How will you? He never comes
anywhere near the church.

115
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:15,468
He is my son.

116
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:16,586
Oh!

117
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,319
Praise be to the Lord!

118
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,798
What do you do, Eesho?

119
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,374
I'm working
for an advertising company.

120
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,193
Though I've been a priest
for so many years,

121
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:27,477
this is the first time
I'm seeing <i>Eesho</i> in person.

122
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,007
Awesome.

123
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:55,758
Mummy!

124
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:57,626
The phone has been ringing
for so long!

125
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,969
Where the hell is Dad?

126
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,093
Oh! Where else could he be?

127
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,711
He has gone in
for his usual exercise.

128
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:04,726
He has begun his exercise?

129
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,540
He will come out
only after an hour then.

130
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:18,086
Can you please come out?

131
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:19,477
If we don't leave
at least by now,

132
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,000
the function will be over
before we reach.

133
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:22,164
Just keep quiet!

134
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,311
There is a war going on in here!

135
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,828
You can fight the rest of it
in the morning.

136
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,977
Just come out!

137
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:32,164
Tough luck.

138
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,195
Oh, my God!

139
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,328
Huh?

140
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,469
What's with this outfit, girl?

141
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,159
It's a wedding reception!

142
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,331
Go, wear a sari.

143
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,719
What's wrong with this outfit?

144
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:48,758
I had told her.

145
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:49,988
But she won't listen.

146
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,120
Only if people see you
dressed in a sari

147
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:54,627
will you get proposals from
boys born in good families.

148
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,030
I'd rather stay single!

149
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,327
Just do as we say.

150
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:00,703
Dad, these are not cheap clothes!

151
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,438
This is Zara's top
and Tommy's jeans!

152
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:04,205
Why are you wearing
other people's clothes?

153
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,659
As if you don't have any?

154
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,330
Dad!

155
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,531
Aren't you ashamed to call yourself
an advertising professional?

156
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,516
These are two of the most
famous brands in the world!

157
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,774
Tommy Hilfiger and Zara.

158
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:14,453
Oh! Like that!

159
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,907
Then you do one thing.

160
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,826
Wear a nice, branded sari.

161
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,575
Do saris have brands?

162
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,333
Saris don't have brands?

163
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:22,536
But...

164
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:23,913
there was an ad shot by that guy

165
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,656
whose alliance we had
considered for you.

166
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,695
That was an ad
of a branded sari, right?

167
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,048
Yeah, what a great brand!

168
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,781
"Peedikapparambil Fancy Clothes,
Kulathuppuzha."

169
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:35,007
Why was I even born
in this family?

170
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:36,102
Forget the shop.

171
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:38,610
What's wrong with him?
He was a nice guy, right?

172
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,141
Dad...

173
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,593
I've told you many times.

174
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,414
If you want a good employee,

175
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,602
you should hire someone
and give him a good salary.

176
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,078
Don't think that you can get me
married to some loser

177
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,039
and make him work
under you for free.

178
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,359
Got it?

179
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,187
Well, what was wrong
with that advertisement?

180
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,946
<i>Kattadi TMT steel bars!</i>

181
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,578
<i>The one that doesn't sway
with the wind!</i>

182
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,610
<i>Very, very strong!</i>

183
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,734
- This is such a lousy ad, John!
- What?

184
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:11,710
If you show this in theatres here,

185
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,406
I'll stop coming to this city!

186
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:15,734
I'd rather work
as a bonded labourer in Bangalore.

187
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:18,350
I had asked you
to do an ad for me, right?

188
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,375
- You didn't do it.
- I gave you an idea, right?

189
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:21,937
Oh, yeah!
You gave me an idea!

190
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,601
What was that? Oh, yes!

191
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,711
- "Engineer's choice."
- Yes.

192
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,062
My dear son, Eesho,
you should understand something.

193
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:31,726
Our steel bars are not purchased
by engineers.

194
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,640
Our steel business

195
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:37,008
is with small-time contractors
and masons.

196
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,443
The commissions and margins
that we give them,

197
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,774
along with a steel bar that
can be bent and twisted as they wish,

198
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:43,827
are what keeps
this business running.

199
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:45,585
Oh! Why did you do this ad then?

200
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,819
I have done this ad to remind
certain others

201
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,194
that I am alive
and running such a business here.

202
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:56,733
No one is going to come running to
buy our steel bars seeing this ad.

203
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:59,913
That's an insult
to the entire advertising community.

204
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,407
Just think about it.

205
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,243
After waking up in the morning,

206
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:05,999
when we apply toothpaste
on the toothbrush,

207
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:07,390
what are we reminded of?

208
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:08,423
A toothpaste ad!

209
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:10,790
After that, we head
straight into the bathroom.

210
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,906
And there we have hair oil,
soap and shampoo.

211
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,099
All these worthless items are habits

212
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,977
created by
advertising professionals.

213
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,672
After all that, when we sit down
to have breakfast,

214
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,788
we buy everything from the batter
for <i>idlis</i> to the flour for <i>puttu,</i>

215
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:26,313
watching the advertisements
made by these professionals.

216
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:29,500
Our entire life is controlled
by advertising professionals.

217
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,235
Whatever you say,

218
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,618
I don't want an advertising guy.

219
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:33,954
Tell me why, Anna.

220
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,780
Well, advertising guys don't know
how to keep secrets.

221
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:38,813
What?

222
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,717
Sir, look here, please!

223
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:54,243
Look into the camera.

224
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,584
Smile, please!

225
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:05,810
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

226
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:07,384
Cheers!

227
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:10,990
Doctor...

228
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,211
So you're all settled now.

229
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,125
Your only daughter's wedding
is over.

230
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,367
And your son-in-law is a doctor.

231
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,991
Now, he can hand over
his hospital to the two of them

232
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:22,936
and chill, having a couple
of pegs every evening.

233
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:23,961
Of course!

234
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,968
My dear John,
it's easier said than done.

235
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,388
My responsibilities
are only going to grow hereafter.

236
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,679
How is that?

237
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:33,921
My son-in-law has brought
a great business proposal.

238
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,055
A foreign investment group.

239
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,227
Our plan is

240
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:42,361
to start a chain called
SMT Group of Maternity Hospitals,

241
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,073
spread across four states.

242
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:48,017
Once we start that,
I'm going to be busier than ever.

243
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,477
As if he's the one birthing babies!

244
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:51,648
Well, Doctor...

245
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:54,193
my company will get the full
advertising contract for it, right?

246
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,633
For what?

247
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:57,656
You're going to open four
or five branches anyway.

248
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,064
You will definitely need us.

249
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:02,500
We did an awesome ad
for John's steel bars recently.

250
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:04,031
John, tell him about it.

251
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:05,665
It was great.
Really cool ad!

252
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:07,999
We're going to release it
in theatres next week.

253
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:10,633
We will sort it out.

254
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:11,969
Don't say that.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,984
We've done everything for you,
right from your logo.

256
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:15,328
You must give this to us.

257
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:16,555
We'll see.

258
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,938
Now you eat.

259
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:24,852
Gosh!

260
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:26,953
You've grown up to be
a fine woman, dear.

261
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,443
You look so beautiful in a sari.

262
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:31,990
Shouldn't we get her married, Elsy?

263
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:34,388
She should feel so too, right?

264
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,513
She has no such thoughts
in her mind.

265
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:38,639
Don't you have anything else
to talk about?

266
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,850
You open your mouths
only to talk about marriage.

267
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,036
- Anna!
- Yes!

268
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:57,353
Well...

269
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:58,461
I...

270
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,485
I was calling my daughter.

271
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:02,985
I...

272
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,118
Dear...

273
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,250
get me an ice cream.

274
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:08,935
Pickle will do for you!

275
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,508
- Hey! Stop it!
- Then?

276
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:14,297
He is borderline diabetic already.

277
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,970
Here you go, Uncle. You have this.
I'll get another one.

278
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,608
See! I got something
as soon as I wished for it.

279
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:20,641
He's smart.

280
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,031
Hey, Eesho!

281
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:24,374
Like I've always told you,

282
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,828
I have left a chair vacant for you
in my company, permanently.

283
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,477
Listen, John...

284
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,640
the creative director's chair

285
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:33,570
belongs to your son.

286
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:37,609
Uncle, we mostly work
for international technology

287
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,210
and fashion brands.

288
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:40,998
I don't really know
how to deal with

289
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,029
obituary columns
and toilet-cleaning lotions.

290
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:48,719
Is that supposed to be funny?

291
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,099
I'll go get some ice cream as well.

292
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:54,086
Oh!

293
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:56,209
Too high-flying for me, huh?

294
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:57,280
Fine!

295
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:07,683
When are you returning?

296
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:09,500
I'll leave tonight.

297
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,309
You're working
at Infosys there, right?

298
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:17,109
No. I moved to ITC now.

299
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:18,374
Oh!

300
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:19,671
Koramangala?

301
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:21,446
No.

302
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:23,125
- Electronic City.
- Ah!

303
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:30,743
I had wanted to call you
for something sometime back.

304
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,445
But I didn't have
your number then.

305
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:33,899
Ah! Really?

306
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,734
The two of you have been
in Bangalore all this while,

307
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,369
and you don't have
each other's numbers?

308
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:41,371
What if you have to call each other
for some emergency?

309
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:43,326
Give her your number.

310
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,688
I'll give it.

311
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,380
Then what are you waiting for?
Give it to her right away.

312
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,546
- 953933..
- Hey!

313
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:51,858
Say it slowly.

314
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:55,289
- 9539..
- Yeah.

315
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,471
33...

316
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:58,456
2222.

317
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:00,277
22, and then another 22.

318
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:01,960
Okay.

319
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,828
Hey!

320
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:12,050
I was thinking about Anna.

321
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,089
She has grown up into a beautiful
young lady, all of a sudden.

322
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,056
How pretty she looked in a sari.

323
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:20,649
- <i>Ichaya</i>...
- Yes?

324
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:23,013
Shall we get her married to him?

325
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,881
Great! That will be amazing!

326
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:28,386
Her father, Kurian...

327
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,148
was head over heels in love
with your mother for five years,

328
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,421
right from our high school days
till the end of college.

329
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:38,031
But she never even
acknowledged his presence.

330
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:41,065
And when he took his father...

331
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,593
to her house to ask for her hand,

332
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:44,954
what did your dad say?

333
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,109
Your dad called them
upstarts and kicked them out.

334
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,492
He must be carrying that grudge
in his mind even now.

335
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,445
Stop it, <i>ichaya</i>.
Those are all old stories.

336
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,399
Who keeps all that
in mind even now?

337
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,847
Is it because he doesn't have it
in his mind even now

338
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,180
that he named his only child
after you?

339
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,229
- <i>Ichaya!</i>
- Oh!

340
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:01,862
Now you two don't start fighting.

341
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,839
I don't dig that girl anyway.

342
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:05,321
What's wrong with her?

343
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,742
Oh! She's as tall as a pole,

344
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,166
and she keeps yapping non-stop.

345
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,906
On top of all that, her name. Anna!

346
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,968
You rascal!
What's wrong with that name?

347
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:15,445
Exactly this!

348
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:16,963
If I call the name "Anna,"
both you and her will respond.

349
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:17,987
Full confusion!

350
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:23,916
Oh, boy!

351
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:25,916
No way! He won't be right for her.

352
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,806
If we're thinking
of a guy like him,

353
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:29,846
Josootty is a much better option
any day, right?

354
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:33,855
He shot that sari ad
so wonderfully after all.

355
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,040
You're still holding on
to that sari?

356
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,428
Is this like that?

357
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,788
He's so dashing.

358
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:39,892
And that name.

359
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,351
- Eesho!
- Yeah, right!

360
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:42,516
His name is <i>Eesho</i>!

361
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,242
But his character is like Judas.

362
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:47,210
When I asked him about joining
our company, what did he say?

363
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,631
He called us
a toilet-cleaning company.

364
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:50,664
That's right, Dad.

365
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:53,039
He's rude to you
whenever he sees you.

366
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:55,352
- Yeah!
- Who does he think he is?

367
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,726
Some advertising genius!

368
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,015
Ask him to get lost!

369
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,719
- Of course!
- He is a little too arrogant.

370
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,213
I'll find an advertising guy
who's better than him

371
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,510
for my daughter.

372
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:09,389
Dad!

373
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:11,802
I just said that in a flow, dear.

374
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:19,561
Watch out.

375
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:22,495
It was raining.
That's why.

376
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,489
Okay. I'll manage that.
Okay.

377

Yes, he is back.

It's your turn today.

397

You've gotten even better at this.

No way!

402
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,454
It's not because I got better.

403
00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:30,295
You feel so because
you went home for two days

404
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,961
and had your mummy's lousy coffee.

405
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:35,159
Oh! Now start bickering
about my family!

406
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,617
Your acting was quite
over the top yesterday.

407

When it comes to acting,
you are always better.

408
00:23:41,164 --> 00:23:42,784
You were so sycophantic!

Well, why do you have always

Why does your dad keep inviting me

whenever he sees me?

413
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:56,546
What's your problem?

414
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,569
My mom's coffee is lousy,

00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:23,586
What?

422
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,827
It was vaguely
like a marriage proposal.

423
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:27,792
Oh! And?

424
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:30,150
Oh! I said no to it immediately.

I can't even imagine
spending a lifetime with you.

Well, Dad has been
pushing me subtly.

But after that,
I may have to give in.

We have one year, right?

Why do we need to get stressed
about it already?

- Awesome, right?
- Absolutely.

But if it was a helmet
that covered your whole face,

475
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:42,700
it would have been even better.

00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:48,619
sucks!

528
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:50,964
Don't drink it
if you can't stand it.

529
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,868
Or bring someone else
who can make coffee like your mom.

530
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:56,118
That's a good idea.

531
00:32:57,032 --> 00:32:58,422
Who can we bring?

532
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:01,055
There's one person.

533
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:03,446
Someone who took over
Sathish's position yesterday.

534
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:05,403
A stunning girl from Thiruvalla.

535
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:07,492
Susan. Susan Mathews.

536
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:09,289
How about her?

537
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:10,837
I'm serious.

538
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:12,399
What a personality!

539
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:13,765
Amazing sense of humour!

540
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,266
Superb reading habits too.

541
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:16,938
We shared such a terrific vibe!

542
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:18,742
She's a die-hard fan
of Orhan Pamuk as well.

543
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:21,679
See!

544
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:23,149
You don't even know who that is.

545
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,086
Great!

546
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:26,617
Who am I even talking to!

547
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:28,094
You do one thing then...

548
00:33:28,235 --> 00:33:29,672
Go and stay with her.

549
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:33,266
For that,
she too has to agree, right?

550
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:34,711
Did you see my phone?

551
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:38,407
Did you see my phone, Anna?

552
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:42,961
I had clicked some great selfies
with her last night.

553
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:44,601
Forgot to send them to her.

554
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:46,453
Where did I keep it?

555
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:12,867
Foul!

556
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:13,999
That's a foul!

557
00:34:14,024 --> 00:34:16,157
Checking my phone
behind my back!

558
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:18,357
Tsk-tsk!
I didn't expect this at all!

559
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,460
I wasn't checking it!

560
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:22,484
When I saw it here, I kept it aside
so that it doesn't fall.

561
00:34:22,508 --> 00:34:24,086
See for yourself.
I haven't checked it.

562
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,141
Let it be.

563
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,655
Give me 20 minutes.
We'll leave.

564
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,211
No. I'll book a cab.

565
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:38,633
Hey, we can leave together.

566
00:34:38,983 --> 00:34:40,811
No one has to take the trouble
of dropping me.

567
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:44,469
I was just joking.

568
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,133
Why do I care
if you check my phone?

569
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:49,727
She has a boyfriend.

570
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:51,581
She's just a new colleague
whom I can talk to.

571
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:52,597
That's all.

572
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:53,743
Do whatever you want!

573
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,204
Why are you saying
all this to me?

574
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:56,423
Who am I? Your wife?

575
00:34:58,782 --> 00:34:59,790
Oh!

576
00:35:00,282 --> 00:35:03,649
So, you do have this emotion
called possessiveness, huh?

577
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,875
- Hey, I was just..
- Let go of me!

578
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:09,017
Oh, no! Anna!

579
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:13,289
Blood!

580
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:37,173
Why do you have to do things
you're not cut out for

581
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:38,213
when you can't handle it?

582
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:44,383
How are you feeling now?

583
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,273
I'm... I'm okay, Doctor.

584
00:35:47,298 --> 00:35:48,609
What is this, young man?

585
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:50,365
A few drops of blood
and you faint?

586
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:52,968
You may leave once the IV is done.

587
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:54,095
Okay?

588
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,352
That's just a small cut.
No need of stitches.

589
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:57,719
- Dressing will be enough.
- Okay.

590
00:35:57,744 --> 00:35:59,710
- [IN KANNADA] Give her a tetanus shot.
- Okay, Doctor.

591
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:00,741
Okay?

592
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:01,774
Thanks.

593
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:03,696
Are you okay otherwise?

594
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:05,257
Yeah, Doctor. I'm fine.

595
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:07,961
Your eyes look pale.

596
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:09,640
Periods are regular, right?

597
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:11,101
Yeah. Periods are..

598
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:30,360
Congratulations!

599
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:31,829
Thank you.

600
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:35,360
For what?

601
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,438
8 weeks.

602
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:37,742
2 months.

603
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:40,733
What?

604
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,592
Anna is two months pregnant.

605
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:54,821
Well... err...

606
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:57,742
I...

607
00:36:58,312 --> 00:36:59,449
Err... actually...

608
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:01,820
Doctor...

609
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,921
It was an accident.

610
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:06,711
Hey, that's all right.

611
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:09,492
This is how it happens
in most cases.

612
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:11,921
Just accept this as God's decision.

613
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:14,561
But...

614
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:17,220
We...

615
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,922
Actually, Doctor... we...

616
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:21,148
We are...

617
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:22,633
not so prepared.

618
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,938
Well, you can start now.

619
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:26,665
Ten months is not just the time

620
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:28,320
a baby needs to grow
in a mother's womb.

621
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:31,764
It is the time for the parents
to become prepared as well.

622
00:37:35,142 --> 00:37:36,142
Well...

623
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,781
We...

624
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:45,196
Is there any way to avoid..

625
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,727
Eesho...

626
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:04,266
See...

627
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,074
the two of you are adults.

628
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:07,516
You are educated.

629
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,611
Eight out of ten people
who come here

630
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:12,143
come praying for a child
to be born somehow.

631
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:16,290
Think about it.

632
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:17,774
Take your time.

633
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,933
Make a wise decision.

634
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:31,171
Anna, I'm not prepared.

635
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:32,204
I'm not prepared at all.

636
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,407
Are you prepared?

637
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,679
No one is prepared, Eesho.

638
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,483
But is this how you react to it?

639
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:39,047
What else do you
expect me to do?

640
00:38:39,156 --> 00:38:41,366
Will you be able to tell your family
that you're pregnant?

641
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,532
We are...

642
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:46,375
They don't even know
that we're in a relationship.

643
00:38:46,985 --> 00:38:48,930
Eesho, whatever you're saying
is right.

644
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:51,954
But...

645
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:57,476
this is a human life!

646
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:11,101
I...

647
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:14,943
I have an urgent meeting to attend.

648
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:26,874
See, triple-layer protection,

649
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:28,358
dotted, ripped,

650
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,218
other patterns of your choice...

651
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:33,218
All these are the competitive
advantages of this product.

652
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:36,078
But how do we take the campaign
away from this?

653
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:38,843
How do we make it more personal?

654
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:40,735
More emotional?

655
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:42,750
Hello? Eesho?

656
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:44,959
Menon? Susan?

657
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:47,109
Come on, Mallu gang!
Give me an idea!

658
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:48,773
One wrong decision

659
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:50,438
can turn your life upside down.

660
00:39:50,673 --> 00:39:51,937
One minor negligence

661
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:53,976
can thwart all your future plans.

662
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,990
You know, something on those lines.

663
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:03,891
What's up with him, man?

664
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,706
What do we do now?

665
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:16,565
I've been asking you that
all this while.

666
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,994
The decision is yours!

667
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,347
- You should tell me.
- Oh!

668
00:40:19,443 --> 00:40:21,380
Really?
Now this problem is just mine?

669
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:24,337
This didn't happen
because of me alone.

670
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:25,714
Did I say that, Anna?

671
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:26,786
Is that what I meant?

672
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:33,295
Yes, Dad.

673
00:40:33,677 --> 00:40:34,685
Where are you?

674
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:35,951
I...

675
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:36,990
I'm in my office.

676
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:39,011
An important meeting is going on.

677
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:40,209
What is it?

678
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,740
There will be buses or trains running
even after your meeting, right?

679
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:44,896
Board one of them.

680
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:46,761
You should be here
tomorrow morning.

681
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:48,740
What?

682
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:49,849
In the morning?

683
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,431
Dad, I just got here!

684
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,191
I called you because
you need to be here.

685
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:57,480
<i>- John, tell me what the matter is.</i>
- Don't say anything.

686
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:59,378
You should be here
tomorrow morning.

687
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:10,363
Did you tell anyone at home?

688
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,396
At whose home?

689
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:13,271
My home.

690
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,823
I'm not so cheap.

691
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:20,193
Did you say anything to anyone..

692
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,723
- Hey, Eesho!
- That's not what I meant!

693
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:24,113
Did you say anything at all
to your friends or someone?

694
00:41:24,138 --> 00:41:26,239
As if this is something
I can brag about!

695
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:27,606
Ugh!

696
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:51,726
How come John is here
to pick me himself?

697
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:52,773
This is unusual.

698
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:09,729
What is it, John?
What happened?

699
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,457
I'll tell you.

700
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:17,365
I will tell you.

701
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:49,146
Annamma!

702
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,435
What happened?

703
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:52,774
John seems like a tough nut
to crack today.

704
00:43:54,503 --> 00:43:55,511
You sit.

705
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:56,544
I'll bring coffee.

706
00:43:58,099 --> 00:43:59,512
Tell me what happened.

707
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:00,584
Eesho!

708
00:44:21,482 --> 00:44:22,490
Eesho...

709
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:24,662
how old do you think you are?

710
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:29,723
Why do you ask, John?

711
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:32,676
When I was your age,

712
00:44:32,848 --> 00:44:34,690
you had flunked
your tenth grade once already.

713
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:38,301
So?

714
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:43,185
So, I believe that you are mature,
wise and old enough

715
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,028
to listen to something
I want to tell you.

716
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:53,529
Son...

717
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,278
your mother is pregnant.

718
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,084
WHAT?

719
00:45:06,326 --> 00:45:07,446
Who did you say is pregnant?

720
00:45:09,261 --> 00:45:10,270
Well...

721
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:13,848
she felt slightly dizzy
and exhausted yesterday,

722
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:15,247
and I took her to the hospital.

723
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:17,841
So, when we got some tests done,

724
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,074
it was our Samuel
who told us that...

725
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:21,849
she's pregnant.

726
00:45:25,185 --> 00:45:26,193
Coffee.

727
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:53,833
So... how do we take this forward?

728
00:45:59,677 --> 00:46:01,816
John, for one moment...
for just one moment...

729
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:03,403
couldn't you have
thought of my face?

730
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,410
You really think your face
is what I think of

731
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:07,629
when I sleep with my wife?

732
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,222
Did you think about the stature
and respect I have in this society?

733
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:13,130
What respect do you have
in this society?

734
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:14,505
This man!

735
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:17,552
Dad, what exactly were you thinking
of when you did this?

736
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:21,177
Is that a question you should
be asking your own father?

737
00:46:22,474 --> 00:46:24,355
We have to meet the doctor
at 11 a.m. today.

738
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,389
You should also be with us.

739
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:28,052
Kattadi, did you ask me to rush
all the way here for this?

740
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,529
As an elder child,

741
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,875
do you prefer a brother or a sister?

742
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,211
I...

743
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,973
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire!

744
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:43,269
That's what is happening now!

745
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:49,805
So, it's been two months.

746
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:54,219
The heartbeat can be seen.

747
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:55,852
Everything looks normal.

748
00:46:56,778 --> 00:47:00,542
I mean, we can't rule out
age-related complications.

749
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,855
There is a risk factor.

750
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,230
- We don't need this then!
- Huh?

751
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:06,222
If there's a risk,
then let's not go ahead with this.

752
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:07,730
No, no.
I didn't mean that.

753
00:47:07,755 --> 00:47:10,606
No. We don't need
any unnecessary risks at all.

754
00:47:10,763 --> 00:47:13,114
On those lines, going out
on the road is also risky, Eesho.

755
00:47:15,341 --> 00:47:17,777
What I meant was that
you should be extra cautious.

756
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,747
That's all.
There's nothing to fear.

757
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:23,145
But a complication is
indeed a complication, Uncle.

758
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,348
That, too, at this age.

759
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:27,223
So, my opinion is that
we shouldn't..

760
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:28,256
Eesho.

761
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:29,989
Come with me.

762
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:31,950
Just a minute, Doctor. Come.

763
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,208
I'll be right back.

764
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:44,137
What is it, Annamma?

765
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:45,209
What happened?

766
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:49,998
This is a human life.

767
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,193
You too were...

768
00:47:52,505 --> 00:47:53,878
in this womb for ten months.

769
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:59,503
It's just that
I can't see it now.

770
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:02,591
But this child is just like you
for me.

771
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,153
Hello?

772
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:36,857
Hello?

773
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:40,038
John called me here

774
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,586
because there was
a slight confusion at home.

775
00:49:43,224 --> 00:49:45,052
I'll tell you everything in person.

776
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:47,451
Where are you now?

777
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:49,646
I'm at home.

778
00:49:50,302 --> 00:49:51,778
Why? You didn't go to the office?

779
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:54,349
No.

780
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,067
What happened?

781
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,286
I didn't go. That's all.

782
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,395
I...

783
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,474
Yesterday...

784
00:50:04,076 --> 00:50:05,084
all of a sudden...

785
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,792
when I heard everything together...

786
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,574
I spoke like that
because I was confused.

787
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:13,380
<i>Forget what I said.</i>

788
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:17,363
We must figure out
our future plans, right?

789
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,685
We'll talk once I get back.

790
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:22,466
Okay?

791
00:50:25,162 --> 00:50:26,170
Anna...

792
00:50:27,959 --> 00:50:28,966
You're okay, right?

793
00:50:31,302 --> 00:50:32,310
Yes.

794
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,076
I love you.

795
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:45,005
I love you too.

796
00:50:55,357 --> 00:50:56,365
Hey!

797
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,228
What are you doing here,
talking on the phone?

798
00:51:00,252 --> 00:51:02,690
Well, I had to make
a couple of office calls.

799
00:51:02,715 --> 00:51:03,849
So that's how it is.

800
00:51:03,943 --> 00:51:07,051
When so much is happening here,
you're worried about your office?

801
00:51:07,177 --> 00:51:09,427
John, I have to go back
and take some decisions..

802
00:51:09,452 --> 00:51:10,692
Where are you going?

803
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,106
You're not going anywhere.

804
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,067
-I have left certain things midway-
-Hey! Hey!

805
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:18,152
I have to go to Ahmedabad
to buy steel in two days.

806
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:21,980
I can entrust her only to you.

807
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,519
There are some very important..

808
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:27,153
Nothing is more important
than this, right?

809
00:51:28,036 --> 00:51:30,107
You won't understand
what's happening there, John.

810
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:33,214
You're talking as if your wife
is pregnant over there.

811
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,699
When did I say that?

812
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,020
You needn't say anything.

813
00:51:36,045 --> 00:51:37,449
You can leave after five days.

814
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:39,839
If you can't even do that,
then resign from your job.

815
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,974
As if I need your money
to buy steel bars!

816
00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:55,216
Hey!

817
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:56,654
Raw spinach,

818
00:51:56,965 --> 00:51:57,973
broccoli,

819
00:51:59,068 --> 00:52:00,708
drumsticks...
Err... maybe not drumsticks.

820
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:02,957
Egg whites, bean sprouts...

821
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:04,701
Ah, here's sweet potato.

822
00:52:05,435 --> 00:52:07,763
- Why do we need all this?
- These are all very important!

823
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:10,357
She needs a lot of proteins
and minerals during this time.

824
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:13,068
Only then will the newborn
be intelligent and wise.

825
00:52:13,918 --> 00:52:16,520
I couldn't buy all this when
she was pregnant with my first child.

826
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,873
So, going all out this time!

827
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:25,787
Come, my firstborn.

828
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:33,099
<i>Raw spinach,</i>

829
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:34,505
<i>sweet potato,</i>

830
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:36,037
<i>bean sprouts,</i>

831
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,527
<i>egg white</i>

832
00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:40,005
<i>and...</i>

833
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:43,534
<i>then a few other things.</i>

834
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:45,784
<i>All these are very good apparently.</i>

835
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:46,903
For what?

836
00:52:47,138 --> 00:52:48,193
Well,

837
00:52:48,218 --> 00:52:50,112
the first three months
are really crucial.

838
00:52:50,591 --> 00:52:51,801
You should be really careful.

839
00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:53,287
Who said so?

840
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:56,715
My dad!

841
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,614
<i>Why did your dad say that?</i>

842
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:03,084
My dad bought all this
for my mom today.

843
00:53:04,076 --> 00:53:05,084
For what?

844
00:53:07,568 --> 00:53:08,880
What would it be for?

845
00:53:09,457 --> 00:53:10,638
How would I know?

846
00:53:11,903 --> 00:53:13,176
Make a guess.

847
00:53:13,505 --> 00:53:16,513
You're talking as if it's your mother
who's pregnant.

848
00:53:19,248 --> 00:53:20,255
Correct!

849
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,388
What?

850
00:53:22,572 --> 00:53:24,199
Stop it! Stop joking!

851
00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:27,411
As if I'm at the age
where I can joke

852
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:28,686
about my mother being pregnant!

853
00:53:29,294 --> 00:53:30,302
What do you mean?

854
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:33,700
I mean... why do you think
my dad asked me to rush here

855
00:53:33,725 --> 00:53:35,677
all of a sudden?

856
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:37,442
Oh, Mom!

857
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:38,942
Not your mom! My mom!

858
00:53:39,435 --> 00:53:40,903
- <i>Eesho!</i>
- Yeah?

859
00:53:41,623 --> 00:53:43,458
Not you! I was calling Jesus!

860
00:53:45,779 --> 00:53:47,325
- What do we do now?
- What can we do?

861
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,927
They are planning
to go ahead with it.

862
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,652
Not that! What about us?

863
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:55,472
I've called you
to discuss just that.

864
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:09,708
Shall we elope?

865
00:54:10,863 --> 00:54:11,871
What?

866
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,926
I can't think of any other idea.

867
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:17,341
Eesho, this is not a joke.

868
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,294
What else do you want us to do?

869
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:21,724
I can't hold on like this
for too long.

870
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:23,810
- We should tell this at home somehow.
- Yes.

871
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:25,323
Tell this to your family.

872
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:27,394
Try to convince
your father somehow.

873
00:54:27,419 --> 00:54:28,488
To my family?

874
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:31,012
I was talking about
telling your family!

875
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:33,365
Don't you know my father?

876
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,436
This is the perfect time
to tell my family, right?

877
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,934
That's exactly what I meant.

878
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,113
What?

879
00:54:39,146 --> 00:54:41,724
Whatever you tell them now,
they won't be shocked beyond a point.

880
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:44,021
<i>Everything is quite
messed up anyway, right?</i>

881
00:54:44,544 --> 00:54:46,028
<i>Present it tactfully.</i>

882
00:54:46,794 --> 00:54:49,817
Uncle John must be feeling awkward
and embarrassed at this point of time.

883
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:51,896
Meanwhile, just tell him,

884
00:54:52,106 --> 00:54:54,745
"Dad, I too had a slip-up,
just like you."

885
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:56,883
Present it like that.

886
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,825
- Will it work?
<i>- Yes.</i>

887
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,395
<i>And one more thing.</i>

888
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,114
<i>Don't tell my family
about your mother.</i>

889
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,191
Why?

890
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,192
Don't even think about us then!

891
00:55:05,966 --> 00:55:06,974
Oh!

892
00:55:07,248 --> 00:55:08,255
Got it.

893
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:10,434
All the best!

894
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:11,896
Thank you.

895
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:26,508
Hey! You will live a hundred years!

896
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:28,675
I was just thinking about you.

897
00:55:29,552 --> 00:55:31,980
You will leave only after
seeing the end of me!

898
00:55:33,008 --> 00:55:34,344
My darling son,

899
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,216
I wanted to ask you something.

900
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:38,089
Well, the matter is...

901
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,446
it's Reena's daughter's
baptism tomorrow.

902
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,324
We have to go to the church anyway

903
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:43,911
and to our ancestral house
soon after.

904
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:45,854
So, we cannot avoid
meeting my mother.

905
00:55:48,373 --> 00:55:50,560
How do I present this to my mother?

906
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:53,607
What?

907
00:55:53,632 --> 00:55:55,632
The fact that
your mother is pregnant.

908
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:01,000
I have never hidden anything
from my mother.

909
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:03,227
How do I tell her about this?

910
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:05,953
Can you give me an idea?

911
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,098
Me?

912
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:10,105
Why do you have to think so much?

913
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,551
- Why don't you just say it?
- No, no!

914
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:13,535
You won't get it.

915
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:17,090
Talking about pregnancy
to our own parents...

916
00:56:17,115 --> 00:56:20,060
Ugh! It's really embarrassing!

917
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:21,769
True. I shouldn't have come.

918
00:56:21,794 --> 00:56:24,363
- What?
- Why should we go there tomorrow?

919
00:56:24,388 --> 00:56:26,232
But we are the child's godparents!

920
00:56:26,271 --> 00:56:27,279
- Don't you..
- Hey!

921
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,918
Dad and son needn't rack
your brains so much.

922
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,693
Saying that you're going to
have a child at this age

923
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:34,114
might be a credit for you.

924
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,208
But I'm quite embarrassed about it.

925
00:56:36,373 --> 00:56:37,879
You don't have to tell her all this.

926
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:39,341
So what?

927
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:40,771
What's wrong if I say it?

928
00:56:40,912 --> 00:56:41,745
Oh!

929
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:43,724
Don't I know your mom by now?

930
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:45,825
The entire town will come to know
about this then.

931
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:49,529
When it's the right time,
I will tell her tactfully.

932
00:56:50,091 --> 00:56:51,551
You don't say it
and ruin everything.

933
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:53,441
Correct! Mummy is correct!

934
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:55,190
You'll say everything
and create a scene,

935
00:56:55,215 --> 00:56:56,792
and finally people will know
this and that,

936
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,953
and everything will be a mess!

937
00:56:57,977 --> 00:56:59,430
- What everything?
- Who?

938
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:01,700
- What do you mean by everything?
- Well...

939
00:57:02,435 --> 00:57:03,770
The baptism is tomorrow, right?

940
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,971
You will go there,
say this and that...

941
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:07,919
and just make a mess of everything.

942
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:09,856
Godfather, it seems. Isn't there
anyone else in this family?

943
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,888
Why?

944
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:12,473
Aren't we good enough?

945
00:57:12,544 --> 00:57:13,551
I didn't mean..

946
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:15,254
For you to get married
and have a child,

947
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:16,575
we'll just have to keep
waiting forever!

948
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,864
When I got a chance,
I agreed to do it. That's all!

949
00:57:19,192 --> 00:57:20,698
Hey, John!

950
00:57:20,723 --> 00:57:23,418
If you keep hurling
these taunts at me, it feels...

951
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,708
Can't believe this guy
is my father!

952
00:57:27,232 --> 00:57:28,240
Taunts?

953
00:57:31,443 --> 00:57:32,451
What happened to him?

954
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:36,385
It's all one sloppy mess.

955
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:04,643
- Have some more.
- How's the food?

956
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:06,151
- All okay?
- It's nice.

957
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:07,673
Sister, some <i>kallappam</i>?

958
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:09,595
- No, thanks. I had it already.
- Have one more.

959
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,627
No, thanks.

960
00:58:10,963 --> 00:58:11,971
Father, <i>kallappam</i>.

961
00:58:11,996 --> 00:58:13,003
Come on, one more.

962
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:20,506
Oh, no!

963
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,024
John, hold this.
I'll bring some <i>kallappam</i>!

964
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:28,200
Hey! This is <i>kallappam</i>...

965
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,283
Shall I serve some beef?

966
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,393
No, thanks.

967
00:58:34,697 --> 00:58:36,783
- Father, praise be to the Lord.
- Always and forever.

968
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:37,916
Sisters!

969
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,018
Aunty!

970
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:40,454
Kurian! Elsy!

971
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:42,211
Be seated.
Get something to eat.

972
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:43,500
Let me go wash my hands.

973
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:44,533
Go ahead.

974
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,111
What are you looking at?
Go inside.

975
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:55,444
- Kurian!
- Joji!

976
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:56,610
- Anna!
- John!

977
00:58:56,635 --> 00:58:57,930
- Am I late?
- No, no!

978
00:58:57,946 --> 00:58:58,946
I'll be right back.

979
00:59:14,994 --> 00:59:15,758
Hello?

980
00:59:15,783 --> 00:59:17,601
I don't understand this!

981
00:59:17,626 --> 00:59:19,726
Why did your dad come here now?

982
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:21,523
Don't you dare bullshit me!

983
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,530
My dad came because
your family invited him.

984
00:59:23,555 --> 00:59:27,556
I am trying to make both ends meet
somehow and in between that...

985
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,422
Dad is just a little tough
on the outside.

986
00:59:29,447 --> 00:59:30,455
He's a softie inside.

987
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:33,072
If you behave affectionately
with my dad,

988
00:59:33,097 --> 00:59:34,105
he will soften up.

989
00:59:34,744 --> 00:59:36,212
This is your best chance!

990
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:38,267
Just soft-soap my dad today.

991
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,916
If that happens, we needn't be
so stressed thereafter.

992
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:43,094
Okay! Okay!

993
00:59:44,743 --> 00:59:46,757
What do I tell her dad now?

994
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:54,415
What a time to crack jokes!

995
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:56,830
Oh, my God!

996
00:59:57,838 --> 00:59:59,049
My back!

997
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:24,689
<i>Ichaya,</i> don't eat that.
I'll bring fresh pickle.

998
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,299
Hi, Uncle.

999
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:36,469
He did this deliberately.

1000
01:00:36,494 --> 01:00:37,869
No doubt about that!

1001
01:00:38,182 --> 01:00:40,361
He ruins my day
every chance he gets.

1002
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:42,000
Stop it, <i>ichaya</i>.

1003
01:00:42,025 --> 01:00:43,205
Stop conjuring up things.

1004
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:44,461
It must have been an accident.

1005
01:00:44,486 --> 01:00:46,821
Why do you always take his side?

1006
01:00:46,846 --> 01:00:49,009
- I...
- I'm not taking anyone's side.

1007
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:50,259
Accident, it seems.

1008
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,538
As if he's a child.
I shouldn't have come here.

1009
01:00:52,563 --> 01:00:54,125
What's happening?
Is it clean yet?

1010
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,296
How?

1011
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:56,329
It's doused in oil.

1012
01:00:56,354 --> 01:00:57,985
It's all wet and greasy!

1013
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,627
What's the husband and wife
doing inside?

1014
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:01,478
- What do I...
- Take a bath if you want.

1015
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:03,759
Or you'll be smelling of pickle
for the whole day.

1016
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,611
- I'll bring a shirt for you.
- Sure!

1017
01:01:05,845 --> 01:01:07,579
Yeah, right! Bathe me and bury me!

1018
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,919
Bring a fresh soap and towel.

1019
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:11,922
I'm talking to you!

1020
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:14,863
Stop gaping and wash this!

1021
01:01:19,729 --> 01:01:20,736
- Hello?
- Hey!

1022
01:01:21,018 --> 01:01:22,025
Did you see my dad yet?

1023
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,283
- Yup!
- Did you soft-soap him?

1024
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:28,135
I am about to.

1025
01:01:30,143 --> 01:01:31,150
How's this?

1026
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:33,548
How can he wear this, <i>achaya</i>?

1027
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:34,698
It's too tight even for me.

1028
01:01:40,377 --> 01:01:41,978
<i>Achaya,</i> how is this?

1029
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:43,080
Isn't it awesome?

1030
01:01:45,377 --> 01:01:47,002
I bought this from Pattaya.

1031
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,266
It's really colourful
and quite loose too.

1032
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:51,603
Yeah. Loose is better.

1033
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:56,201
- Come.
- All of you, please look here.

1034
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:57,841
Come here!

1035
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,138
Smile, please!

1036
01:02:00,707 --> 01:02:01,715
Smile!

1037
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:05,294
Okay!

1038
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:16,981
Sister, pack this duck roast too.

1039
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:18,277
That's okay. Let it be.

1040
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:20,291
Why? Isn't it from your own house?

1041
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:21,955
Now you don't have to go
back home and cook.

1042
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:22,987
Oh! That's right.

1043
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:24,808
I can't go back and toil now.

1044
01:02:27,363 --> 01:02:28,464
Hey!

1045
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:30,288
Where's the sweet and sour
ginger pickle?

1046
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:32,081
It was delicious!

1047
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:34,144
I wanted to ask for some more.

1048
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:35,831
- Is it over?
- No, sister.

1049
01:02:35,856 --> 01:02:36,864
It's here.

1050
01:02:37,675 --> 01:02:38,683
Ah!

1051
01:02:56,854 --> 01:02:59,385
How come you're so tempted
by sweet and sour ginger pickle?

1052
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:01,596
The sweet and sour ginger pickle...

1053
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:02,636
Its taste...

1054
01:03:03,058 --> 01:03:04,160
It's really good.

1055
01:03:04,293 --> 01:03:07,628
Is it? Give me some too.
Let me try it.

1056
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:16,957
You're right. It's really good.

1057
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:19,916
By the way, do one thing.

1058
01:03:19,941 --> 01:03:22,043
Go and ask your husband
to come to my room.

1059
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:24,355
- Why, Mom?
- Well, well!

1060
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,433
Why do I need your permission
to talk to my son?

1061
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:28,745
Huh?

1062
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,378
Just ask him to come, girl!

1063
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:39,730
- Praise be to the Lord.
- Praise be to the Lord.

1064
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,393
Hey! Your mom wants to see you.

1065
01:03:43,418 --> 01:03:45,049
Alone, in her room.

1066
01:03:47,315 --> 01:03:48,846
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

1067
01:03:58,254 --> 01:04:00,128
What is it, Mom?
Did you call me?

1068
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:04,369
On top of my cupboard,

1069
01:04:04,394 --> 01:04:05,941
you'll find my medicated oil.

1070
01:04:06,245 --> 01:04:07,299
Bring it here.

1071
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,128
Must be because I've been
standing since morning;

1072
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:12,800
My legs are killing me.

1073
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:16,096
There's no better masseur than you.

1074
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:17,635
Go.

1075
01:04:18,081 --> 01:04:19,088
Why not!

1076
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:26,713
Oh, dear Lord!

1077
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:30,742
When the people here massage me,
it's never warm or strong enough.

1078
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:31,775
Gosh!

1079
01:04:34,315 --> 01:04:35,627
Yeah! Like that!

1080
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:37,352
Press it tightly!

1081
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,572
- Johnnykutty!
- Yes?

1082
01:04:43,611 --> 01:04:45,142
Look at me.

1083
01:04:46,572 --> 01:04:47,595
What is it, Mom?

1084
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,564
Nothing.
Just wanted to see your face.

1085
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,377
You're so good.

1086
01:04:54,197 --> 01:04:55,379
Really good.

1087
01:04:57,252 --> 01:04:58,260
Hey, look at me.

1088
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,517
What is it, Mom?

1089
01:05:00,783 --> 01:05:04,252
What's that glow
on your wife's face?

1090
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,307
Is it?

1091
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:08,946
She has a glow?
I didn't think so.

1092
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,017
But I did!

1093
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,251
What's the matter?

1094
01:05:13,431 --> 01:05:14,891
To attend this function,

1095
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,000
she had gone to a beauty salon.

1096
01:05:17,172 --> 01:05:19,430
Maybe that's why.

1097
01:05:20,244 --> 01:05:21,252
Really?

1098
01:05:22,171 --> 01:05:23,632
Well, so be it then.

1099
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,109
- Johnnykutty!
- Yes?

1100
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,541
Look at me.

1101
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:32,986
What is it, Mom?

1102
01:05:34,048 --> 01:05:36,954
I have given birth
to eight children, including you!

1103
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:40,978
Which beauty salon
did your wife go to?

1104
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:43,846
Huh?

1105
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:47,352
Mom, it's just...

1106
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:49,736
How many months is it now?

1107
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:52,322
Two.

1108
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:01,996
When I gave birth to Nancy,

1109
01:06:02,268 --> 01:06:04,114
I was around the same age.

1110
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:05,557
That means

1111
01:06:05,735 --> 01:06:08,175
there will be
age-related complications.

1112
01:06:08,313 --> 01:06:09,321
You should be careful.

1113
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:12,915
Mom, I haven't really told this
to anyone.

1114
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,947
You shouldn't.

1115
01:06:14,189 --> 01:06:16,098
Don't tell this to anyone now.

1116
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:18,695
You know how our people are, right?

1117
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,789
There will be rumors
and gossip all around.

1118
01:06:20,824 --> 01:06:22,273
It's not like the old times either.

1119
01:06:22,707 --> 01:06:24,515
I won't tell this to anyone.

1120
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:26,640
You don't, either.

1121
01:06:28,138 --> 01:06:29,476
You never have time for me.

1122
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,356
How come you have
so much time for her?

1123
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,075
Mom, I'll just...

1124
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,427
You are impossible.

1125
01:06:35,435 --> 01:06:37,192
Your dad was the same.

1126
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:39,115
What?

1127
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,503
Oh!

1128
01:06:40,528 --> 01:06:43,887
He couldn't keep
his hands off me either.

1129
01:06:46,989 --> 01:06:48,606
Mom, I'm going downstairs.

1130
01:06:51,254 --> 01:06:52,809
Close that bottle tightly.

1131
01:06:53,107 --> 01:06:54,154
Yeah, yeah.

1132
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:56,357
Get going.

1133
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:06,168
Hey!

1134
01:07:07,317 --> 01:07:09,058
What are you doing,
standing here?

1135
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:10,114
Hey!

1136
01:07:10,285 --> 01:07:11,884
Do you know something?

1137
01:07:12,003 --> 01:07:14,402
- My mother is a sweetheart.
- Yes.

1138
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:16,004
Mom caught us red-handed.

1139
01:07:16,029 --> 01:07:17,519
But she was so cool about it.

1140
01:07:17,904 --> 01:07:19,886
Our family's positive vibe

1141
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,059
and our elders' attitude
are just awesome.

1142
01:07:22,161 --> 01:07:23,615
Since I had the medicated oil
in hand,

1143
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,434
things went much smoother
than I expected.

1144
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,754
In that case...

1145
01:07:26,779 --> 01:07:28,357
- I have something to tell you.
- Tell me.

1146
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:30,496
Our family's positive vibe

1147
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:32,832
and our elders' attitude
should apply even then.

1148
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:33,903
Tell me, sweetheart.

1149
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:35,724
Your dad is here to solve
any problem of yours!

1150
01:07:35,748 --> 01:07:37,457
Kattadi John is here! Tell me!

1151
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:40,395
- Dad... I...
- You?

1152
01:07:40,731 --> 01:07:43,300
- I too had a slip-up like you.
- Yes, yes! Yes?

1153
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:45,081
- Johnnykutty!
- Oops! It's Mom!

1154
01:07:45,106 --> 01:07:47,168
Hold this. You must tell me, okay?
I'll be right back.

1155
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:48,263
John!

1156
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,408
Here you go.

1157
01:07:55,443 --> 01:07:57,536
Enough, man!
You have stuffed in enough.

1158
01:07:58,656 --> 01:07:59,960
Come and get in, quickly.

1159
01:08:00,419 --> 01:08:02,135
Always talking
till the last moment.

1160
01:08:02,174 --> 01:08:03,455
I'm coming!

1161
01:08:03,807 --> 01:08:06,353
I have to drop you home
and reach the airport at 5 p.m.

1162
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:09,448
There are no more direct flights
to Ahmedabad this week.

1163
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:11,268
Oh! You're leaving?

1164
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,917
Here you go.
This is for you.

1165
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:18,291
What is it, Mom?

1166
01:08:18,316 --> 01:08:19,511
Sweet and sour ginger pickle!

1167
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:21,778
- Didn't you say that you love it?
- Oh!

1168
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:24,122
Mom is always partial
towards her elder daughter-in-law.

1169
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:27,184
We're staying with you full time,
and we get nothing!

1170
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:30,434
Not just ginger pickle,
I'll prepare whatever you want.

1171
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,037
But, for that, your husband
should be capable enough.

1172
01:08:34,185 --> 01:08:35,388
Right, Johnnykutty?

1173
01:08:36,348 --> 01:08:38,560
Yeah! Come on, let's go!

1174
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:40,894
- Get into the car, everyone.
- Bye.

1175
01:08:40,919 --> 01:08:42,425
- Joji!
- Careful with the jar!

1176
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,990
Careful with the jar.

1177
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:01,114
John.

1178
01:09:02,497 --> 01:09:03,582
John.

1179
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:04,662
I...

1180
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,520
I need to tell you something.

1181
01:09:26,051 --> 01:09:27,059
John.

1182
01:09:27,276 --> 01:09:28,283
We've reached.

1183
01:09:28,308 --> 01:09:29,426
- Have we?
- Yeah.

1184
01:09:29,684 --> 01:09:30,684
I...

1185
01:09:31,285 --> 01:09:33,846
- I need to tell you something.
- There are a couple of things.

1186
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:36,848
One, Annamma has to be taken
for a check-up tomorrow.

1187
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:39,786
Don't make her exert too much.

1188
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:42,184
You should give her the medicines
at the right time.

1189
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,582
I'll do all that.

1190
01:09:43,607 --> 01:09:45,482
- But I need to tell you something.
- Just a minute.

1191
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:46,639
Hello?

1192
01:09:46,664 --> 01:09:47,672
Rajeev!

1193
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:50,163
- John...
- I was about to call you!

1194
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:02,661
That's what I said.

1195
01:10:02,974 --> 01:10:04,292
I've kept the cheque ready.

1196
01:10:04,318 --> 01:10:05,325
You just have to give it.

1197
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:07,424
Hold on with the next payment.

1198
01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:08,822
We'll meet once I'm back.

1199
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:10,387
Hey!

1200
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:13,372
- I need to tell you something.
- Oops. I forgot something.

1201
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:15,582
The cheque is not at the office.
It's at home.

1202
01:10:15,622 --> 01:10:17,559
You should go
and give it to Rajeev.

1203
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,560
- It is for Karim Sahib in Palakkad.
- I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING!

1204
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:23,941
What's with the anger?

1205
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:25,520
If you want to say something,
say it.

1206
01:10:25,707 --> 01:10:26,715
Yeah.

1207
01:10:27,121 --> 01:10:28,950
You know... Anna?

1208
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,238
Who? Your mother?

1209
01:10:30,598 --> 01:10:31,886
Not my mother, Anna.

1210
01:10:31,911 --> 01:10:33,362
Uncle Kurian's daughter, Anna.

1211
01:10:33,387 --> 01:10:34,533
Yes, Anna.

1212
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:36,332
That Anna...

1213
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:37,761
is pregnant.

1214
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:38,794
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1215
01:10:39,824 --> 01:10:40,832
Huh?

1216
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:44,309
How?

1217
01:10:44,762 --> 01:10:46,041
If you ask me how...

1218
01:11:39,285 --> 01:11:40,293
Please come.

1219
01:11:44,224 --> 01:11:45,232
You didn't go, <i>ichaya</i>?

1220
01:11:45,544 --> 01:11:46,552
No.

1221
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,070
Didn't you say that it was
a really important meeting?

1222
01:11:51,051 --> 01:11:53,272
When much more important things
are happening here,

1223
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,413
how can I go?

1224
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:56,991
I knew it.

1225
01:11:57,589 --> 01:11:58,496
What?

1226
01:11:58,521 --> 01:12:00,551
That you won't go,
leaving me in this condition.

1227
01:12:00,668 --> 01:12:01,676
Oh, yeah!

1228
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,667
Didn't I tell you
that I'll be all right?

1229
01:12:07,137 --> 01:12:08,145
Will you say it...

1230
01:12:08,308 --> 01:12:09,316
or should I say it?

1231
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:11,269
You say it, Dad.

1232
01:12:12,216 --> 01:12:13,567
Tell me what the matter is!

1233
01:12:15,278 --> 01:12:16,755
Well, you know...

1234
01:12:17,425 --> 01:12:18,558
Anna?

1235
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,067
- Who?
- Kurian's daughter.

1236
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:22,544
Yes! Anna.

1237
01:12:22,684 --> 01:12:24,676
Anna. She too is like you now.

1238
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,341
Like me?

1239
01:12:27,005 --> 01:12:28,510
She's pregnant!

1240
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:32,088
- Oh, <i>Eesho</i>!
- Yup! It's Eesho indeed!

1241
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,426
Where are you hiding?

1242
01:13:03,582 --> 01:13:05,417
I had warned you.

1243
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:06,997
What?

1244
01:13:07,362 --> 01:13:09,151
Not to name him after <i>Eesho</i>.

1245
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,375
EESHO, THE SAVIOUR OF THIS HOME

1246
01:13:52,026 --> 01:13:53,480
You could have told me!

1247
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:56,237
John told me about coming here
only at dawn today.

1248
01:13:56,393 --> 01:13:58,658
He booked flight tickets
immediately, and here we are!

1249
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:00,182
I tried calling you so many times.

1250
01:14:00,285 --> 01:14:01,581
Eesho, didn't I tell you?

1251
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:03,198
I was vomiting all night.

1252
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:05,151
I went to sleep only at dawn.

1253
01:14:05,597 --> 01:14:06,996
So, I couldn't check my phone.

1254
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:08,777
What's the point
in saying all this now?

1255
01:14:08,801 --> 01:14:09,925
Go and give it to him.

1256
01:14:10,855 --> 01:14:11,863
Me?

1257
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:13,176
Then who? Me?

1258
01:14:16,503 --> 01:14:17,589
Come.

1259
01:14:22,136 --> 01:14:23,144
Uncle...

1260
01:14:23,238 --> 01:14:24,246
Coffee.

1261
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:30,028
So, you know how to turn out
like normal humans too, huh?

1262
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:32,909
Well, that photo was
clicked two years back...

1263
01:14:41,222 --> 01:14:43,538
So, it's been a while
since this sojourn began.

1264
01:14:44,233 --> 01:14:46,873
How come things
got so delayed then?

1265
01:14:47,256 --> 01:14:49,943
- The 10th month after I married your mom..
- Dad!

1266
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:51,045
Well...

1267
01:14:51,514 --> 01:14:52,631
Just saying.

1268
01:15:03,006 --> 01:15:04,014
Sit down.

1269
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,021
- No, thanks.
- I wasn't talking to you.

1270
01:15:07,358 --> 01:15:08,576
Sit down, dear. Come.

1271
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:22,944
Uncle, aren't you
drinking the coffee?

1272
01:15:22,968 --> 01:15:23,976
No, no!

1273
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:25,092
So, what's the plan?

1274
01:15:25,616 --> 01:15:26,897
How do we take this forward?

1275
01:15:28,272 --> 01:15:30,342
We must tell this
to Kurian anyway.

1276
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:33,201
How do you think Kurian
will react to this?

1277
01:15:33,287 --> 01:15:34,918
You know how my dad is, right?

1278
01:15:34,943 --> 01:15:36,996
Yes, that's a problem indeed.

1279
01:15:38,403 --> 01:15:39,950
Back when we were in college,

1280
01:15:40,092 --> 01:15:43,107
some bus conductor misbehaved
with his younger sister.

1281
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:45,365
And this fellow barged
into the Kottayam bus stand

1282
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:48,099
and beat up all the conductors
there and made them vomit blood!

1283
01:15:51,312 --> 01:15:52,320
So, yeah!

1284
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:53,366
It is a problem!

1285
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:54,650
It is a problem indeed!

1286
01:15:54,874 --> 01:15:55,882
Well...

1287
01:15:55,913 --> 01:15:56,921
Dad...

1288
01:15:57,115 --> 01:15:59,438
Aren't you Uncle Kurian's
best friend?

1289
01:15:59,678 --> 01:16:02,219
I'm sure you can tactfully
present this to him.

1290
01:16:02,406 --> 01:16:04,116
Perfect news to present tactfully!

1291
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,303
Aren't you happy that
I am living a peaceful life?

1292
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:12,576
I'd like to stay alive at least
until I see my second child.

1293
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:14,319
Uncle, I completely forgot about it.

1294
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:15,990
Congrats.

1295
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,584
Same to you. Same to you.

1296
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:21,732
Well, what I'm trying
to say is that...

1297
01:16:22,194 --> 01:16:24,900
it will be a problem only if
we say this to him directly, right?

1298
01:16:27,108 --> 01:16:29,678
We'll come to your house
with a marriage proposal.

1299
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:36,170
Well,

1300
01:16:36,195 --> 01:16:38,115
there are no other
complications, right?

1301
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,365
The families know each other,

1302
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,741
and we belong to the same parish.

1303
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,010
We're very close too.

1304
01:16:42,882 --> 01:16:45,080
And if I ask something like this,

1305
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:47,448
I believe Kurian just can't say no.

1306
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:49,232
What do you think?

1307
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:50,569
But, Uncle...

1308
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,511
Dad is not very fond of Eesho.

1309
01:16:53,355 --> 01:16:54,421
Quite natural.

1310
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,519
We can't blame your dad for that.

1311
01:16:57,186 --> 01:16:58,621
What is there to like in him?

1312
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,834
Don't think any further.

1313
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,387
Pack whatever you have to.

1314
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:04,950
Let's catch the next flight
to Kerala.

1315
01:17:04,975 --> 01:17:07,319
I'll figure a way
to tell this to Kurian,

1316
01:17:07,344 --> 01:17:08,938
and come home to see the "bride."

1317
01:17:09,443 --> 01:17:11,115
And we'll conduct the wedding
as soon as possible.

1318
01:17:11,139 --> 01:17:12,428
Let's take the rest as it comes.

1319
01:17:12,655 --> 01:17:13,662
But, Uncle...

1320
01:17:13,975 --> 01:17:15,186
How can I go home now?

1321
01:17:15,663 --> 01:17:16,671
Why?

1322
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:17,772
Well...

1323
01:17:17,858 --> 01:17:19,420
Whatever I eat now,

1324
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:20,780
I keep vomiting it out.

1325
01:17:24,857 --> 01:17:27,193
If I go home, Mummy will definitely
figure something's wrong.

1326
01:17:27,217 --> 01:17:28,879
How do we do this then?

1327
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:35,249
Do one thing.

1328
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:36,911
Tell your mom that

1329
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,760
you came by train and the <i>vada</i>
or tea you had in the train

1330
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,119
upset your stomach.

1331
01:17:40,225 --> 01:17:42,568
Blame it on Indian Railways
for a couple of days.

1332
01:17:43,015 --> 01:17:44,186
By then, I will...

1333
01:17:47,046 --> 01:17:48,053
figure out a plan.

1334
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:54,857
I'm going on a long leave.

1335
01:17:54,882 --> 01:17:57,069
- I'll be back only after a while.
- What's the long leave for?

1336
01:17:57,093 --> 01:17:58,615
Any good news?

1337
01:17:59,147 --> 01:18:02,194
What... what good news?
There's no good news.

1338
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,522
I'm sure there is!

1339
01:18:03,562 --> 01:18:05,138
My wife told me
in the morning...

1340
01:18:05,163 --> 01:18:07,296
that Anna looks like
she could be carrying.

1341
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:09,052
Good news should always be...

1342
01:18:10,108 --> 01:18:11,521
Anna! Congratulations!

1343
01:18:13,483 --> 01:18:14,491
Careful!

1344
01:18:15,428 --> 01:18:16,644
Hello.

1345
01:18:17,147 --> 01:18:18,155
Who is this?

1346
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:19,959
Your elder brother?

1347
01:18:24,053 --> 01:18:25,053
My dad.

1348
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:26,062
Oh, dad...

1349
01:18:26,194 --> 01:18:27,240
Dad?

1350
01:18:27,265 --> 01:18:28,412
He's your father?

1351
01:18:28,678 --> 01:18:30,646
Sir! Wow!

1352
01:18:30,795 --> 01:18:32,107
She's a gem of a girl.

1353
01:18:32,258 --> 01:18:33,937
It's been three years
since they got married.

1354
01:18:33,961 --> 01:18:35,926
My wife and I have been
praying to all the gods

1355
01:18:35,951 --> 01:18:37,317
to bless them with a child.

1356
01:18:37,457 --> 01:18:38,465
Oh, no.

1357
01:18:39,546 --> 01:18:41,517
We're happy now, sir.

1358
01:18:46,248 --> 01:18:47,256
Three years?

1359
01:18:53,326 --> 01:18:55,286
How many years
has it actually been?

1360
01:18:55,318 --> 01:18:56,318
Four.

1361
01:19:01,248 --> 01:19:02,248
Hey!

1362
01:19:10,124 --> 01:19:11,132
Come, dear.

1363
01:19:20,858 --> 01:19:22,003
Don't worry.

1364
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,328
Everything will be all right.

1365
01:19:26,787 --> 01:19:27,795
I'm here for you.

1366
01:19:28,381 --> 01:19:29,389
We're all here for you.

1367
01:19:29,513 --> 01:19:30,521
Okay?

1368
01:19:33,099 --> 01:19:34,106
Get going.

1369
01:19:56,849 --> 01:19:59,446
I feel, if we don't start
operating things quickly,

1370
01:19:59,926 --> 01:20:01,113
everything will go kaput.

1371
01:20:02,225 --> 01:20:04,610
I'll call Mr. K
and meet him today itself.

1372
01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:08,247
And we'll take things forward
as we planned.

1373
01:20:08,685 --> 01:20:09,943
Mr. K?

1374
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:12,779
Kurian!

1375
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:13,997
Huh?

1376
01:20:14,778 --> 01:20:15,778
Kurian!

1377
01:20:16,224 --> 01:20:17,232
Oh!

1378
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,519
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello. Where are you?

1379
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:24,621
I am with Dr. Samuel.
What is it, John?

1380
01:20:24,873 --> 01:20:26,527
How about we catch up
this evening?

1381
01:20:26,608 --> 01:20:27,934
- Where?
- Err...

1382
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:29,957
Let's meet at Hotel Hyatt.

1383
01:20:29,982 --> 01:20:31,503
Why not?
See you in the evening then.

1384
01:20:31,528 --> 01:20:33,231
- I'll call you. Bye!
<i>- Okay.</i>

1385
01:20:35,755 --> 01:20:36,794
It's John.

1386
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,528
So, Kurian,

1387
01:20:39,553 --> 01:20:41,465
like I was saying,

1388
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:43,599
I spoke to my son-in-law
about this.

1389
01:20:43,849 --> 01:20:44,855
The thing is...

1390
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,584
it's a huge project.

1391
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:48,912
We're planning to start this
in five cities,

1392
01:20:48,936 --> 01:20:53,600
including Kochi, Calicut, Chennai,
Hyderabad and Pune, in one go.

1393
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,669
So, he thinks

1394
01:20:55,694 --> 01:20:57,200
it's safer to go
with some top agency

1395
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:59,147
from Bombay or Bangalore
for this job.

1396
01:20:59,171 --> 01:21:02,568
He has budged a little bit
upon my insistence alone.

1397
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,231
So, you can present
a concept, Kurian.

1398
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:08,896
Only if it's really good,
he said the campaign is yours.

1399
01:21:08,921 --> 01:21:11,357
That's enough, Doctor.
You just have to give us a chance.

1400
01:21:11,405 --> 01:21:13,973
We'll present
the best concept to you.

1401
01:21:13,998 --> 01:21:15,006
One more thing.

1402
01:21:15,115 --> 01:21:17,672
Top agencies based
in Bombay and Delhi

1403
01:21:17,688 --> 01:21:19,115
will also present their concepts.

1404
01:21:19,139 --> 01:21:21,708
If you don't get the contract,
don't be upset with me.

1405
01:21:21,733 --> 01:21:22,904
Don't worry at all.

1406
01:21:23,014 --> 01:21:25,584
We'll bring a cracker of an idea.

1407
01:21:25,609 --> 01:21:26,617
Okay.

1408
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,406
- Thanks, brother.
- Okay.

1409
01:21:44,459 --> 01:21:45,279
Well, well!

1410
01:21:45,304 --> 01:21:47,755
How come you decided to come,
just like that?

1411
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,286
I thought I'll give you a surprise.

1412
01:21:49,311 --> 01:21:50,826
I'll be working from home
for two weeks.

1413
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,498
Anyway, you're really lucky!

1414
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:53,825
Why so, Elsy darling?

1415
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,380
It's your favourite
on the menu today.

1416
01:21:56,405 --> 01:21:58,349
Boiled arums and sardine curry.

1417
01:22:13,818 --> 01:22:15,430
What is it?
What happened?

1418
01:22:15,455 --> 01:22:18,485
Well, I ate a <i>vada</i>
from the train in the morning.

1419
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,063
It started since then.
Bad idea, I guess.

1420
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,497
What's wrong with you?

1421
01:22:21,522 --> 01:22:23,642
Haven't I told you not to eat
anything from the train?

1422
01:22:32,686 --> 01:22:34,831
Say something, Kurian!

1423
01:22:35,573 --> 01:22:36,600
I agree.

1424
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:37,944
She's old enough to be married.

1425
01:22:38,192 --> 01:22:40,804
And if it is to your family,
that makes me happier.

1426
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,433
Nothing to be worried about.

1427
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,084
Our families are really close
as well.

1428
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:46,474
But, my dear John,

1429
01:22:46,717 --> 01:22:50,794
even God doesn't know what's on
the minds of kids these days.

1430
01:22:51,146 --> 01:22:53,942
The last time I spoke to her
about a proposal,

1431
01:22:53,967 --> 01:22:56,114
she was ready to eat me up!

1432
01:22:56,701 --> 01:22:58,990
She has been saying that
she doesn't want to get married

1433
01:22:59,006 --> 01:22:59,881
for many years now.

1434
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:01,966
Dude, Annamma suggested this to me.

1435
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:03,280
I thought it was a good idea,

1436
01:23:03,305 --> 01:23:06,018
and so I said this to you without
giving it too much of a thought.

1437
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:06,662
- But..
- Hey.

1438
01:23:06,686 --> 01:23:09,005
Go home and discuss this
with your wife.

1439
01:23:09,061 --> 01:23:10,373
- Well, I..
- Ask Elsy.

1440
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:13,278
If Elsy is okay with it,
try presenting it to Anna.

1441
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:16,098
If she says no,
we'll forget this immediately.

1442
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:17,146
John!

1443
01:23:17,162 --> 01:23:18,091
Don't think any further.

1444
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:19,834
Let's have a couple of pegs
and get down to business.

1445
01:23:19,858 --> 01:23:20,865
Kiddo!

1446
01:23:20,982 --> 01:23:22,169
Two JDs. Make them large.

1447
01:23:22,194 --> 01:23:23,202
Okay, sir.

1448
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:35,721
Tell me what happened!

1449
01:23:36,107 --> 01:23:37,552
There's nothing much to say.

1450
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:39,661
I have presented
the matter to him.

1451
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:43,840
But he wasn't exactly
jumping with joy.

1452
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:45,472
Well, can't blame him, can we?

1453
01:23:48,318 --> 01:23:49,326
Why?

1454
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,458
Did he say something?

1455
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:51,576
He said nothing.

1456
01:23:51,638 --> 01:23:52,646
Then?

1457
01:23:52,786 --> 01:23:55,895
When he came to your house
to ask for your hand,

1458
01:23:56,108 --> 01:23:57,115
what did your father do?

1459
01:23:57,342 --> 01:23:58,763
He set the dog on him, right?

1460
01:23:59,858 --> 01:24:02,658
So, he won't be interested in getting
his daughter married to our family.

1461
01:24:02,682 --> 01:24:04,057
You can't blame him for that!

1462
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:06,348
Yeah, right. As if he's keeping
all that in his mind.

1463
01:24:07,474 --> 01:24:09,303
And he won't be interested
in this guy either.

1464
01:24:09,328 --> 01:24:11,624
He keeps annoying Kurian
every chance he gets!

1465
01:24:11,819 --> 01:24:12,654
Hey, you!

1466
01:24:12,679 --> 01:24:14,240
After creating such a mess,

1467
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:17,209
why do you have to keep getting on
his nerves every time you see him?

1468
01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:19,685
How would I have known
that things will turn out this way?

1469
01:24:19,748 --> 01:24:20,756
What?

1470
01:24:21,255 --> 01:24:22,263
<i>Ichaya!</i>

1471
01:24:22,334 --> 01:24:23,342
I'm not saying anything.

1472
01:24:24,014 --> 01:24:27,154
Anyway, I've convinced Kurian
to talk to his daughter about this.

1473
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:28,926
She won't say no, right?

1474
01:24:29,389 --> 01:24:31,599
Guess that will be the end
of all problems.

1475
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:34,975
Hey!

1476
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,962
She won't say no, right?

1477
01:24:38,809 --> 01:24:40,203
Well, we can't say!

1478
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,610
She has got two days
to think about this.

1479
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:45,389
An entire lifetime with him
can be quite scary!

1480
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:49,536
John, I'm like a dog
whose head got stuck in a pot.

1481
01:24:49,561 --> 01:24:50,569
But...

1482
01:24:50,701 --> 01:24:52,239
I had the same slip-up
as him, right?

1483
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:54,162
See! See the attitude?

1484
01:24:54,811 --> 01:24:56,381
Why blame Kurian?

1485
01:24:56,536 --> 01:24:58,847
If I had a daughter, I won't get her
married to him.

1486
01:24:58,872 --> 01:24:59,880
Arrogant scoundrel!

1487
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:02,357
<i>- Ichaya!</i>
- Okay, just "scoundrel" then.

1488
01:25:05,763 --> 01:25:08,575
I don't understand
what your problem is.

1489
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,817
I think this is a good proposal.

1490
01:25:10,842 --> 01:25:12,653
Didn't I tell you
when I saw him that day

1491
01:25:12,678 --> 01:25:15,248
that he's smart and dashing?

1492
01:25:15,273 --> 01:25:17,467
Yeah, right!
As if he is the only one!

1493
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:18,973
Elsy, I told you, right?

1494
01:25:18,998 --> 01:25:20,435
Should I keep repeating myself?

1495
01:25:22,887 --> 01:25:23,895
Well,

1496
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,442
I don't understand
why you're vouching for him.

1497
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:27,904
Aren't there other boys in town?

1498
01:25:28,553 --> 01:25:30,887
What are you saying?
Who else is there in our parish?

1499
01:25:30,912 --> 01:25:32,059
There are so many guys!

1500
01:25:32,084 --> 01:25:33,926
Name one.

1501
01:25:34,474 --> 01:25:36,434
What about Kalekkuzhi Jose's son?

1502
01:25:36,459 --> 01:25:37,467
Isn't he smart?

1503
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,833
Like you said, he's dashing too.

1504
01:25:39,858 --> 01:25:41,622
Yeah, he's dashing indeed.

1505
01:25:41,647 --> 01:25:43,475
But I heard that
he's living together

1506
01:25:43,506 --> 01:25:45,160
with some girl in Bangalore.

1507
01:25:45,184 --> 01:25:46,192
What?

1508
01:25:47,897 --> 01:25:48,905
How did you know that?

1509
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:50,818
I just have to sit here.

1510
01:25:50,881 --> 01:25:52,232
I have ears everywhere.

1511
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:54,092
Fine.

1512
01:25:54,256 --> 01:25:55,264
There are other guys too.

1513
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:57,084
I will bring a proposal.

1514
01:25:57,209 --> 01:25:58,559
- You watch!
- My dear <i>ichaya,</i>

1515
01:25:58,584 --> 01:26:00,599
I think this is a good alliance.

1516
01:26:00,983 --> 01:26:02,951
Just because that boy
cracked a joke,

1517
01:26:03,106 --> 01:26:05,252
should we reject
such a great alliance?

1518
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,081
Ask her about this.

1519
01:26:08,106 --> 01:26:09,582
We have to proceed
only if she's okay, right?

1520
01:26:09,606 --> 01:26:11,855
Yeah, right!
What a thoughtful joke to make!

1521
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,206
What did he say that day?

1522
01:26:13,231 --> 01:26:14,989
Toilet-cleaning company, right?

1523
01:26:15,397 --> 01:26:17,834
Elsy, no more discussions
about this.

1524
01:26:17,975 --> 01:26:19,856
He wants my daughter!

1525
01:26:19,959 --> 01:26:22,630
We need not ask her opinion on this.

1526
01:26:22,655 --> 01:26:25,122
She had said that day itself
that he's a little too arrogant!

1527
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:27,186
I'm going to call John
and say no right away.

1528
01:26:27,755 --> 01:26:29,215
You won't understand!

1529
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,557
Do whatever you want!

1530
01:26:42,278 --> 01:26:43,286
Hello?

1531
01:26:52,987 --> 01:26:54,587
Hello, Kurian?

1532
01:26:54,612 --> 01:26:56,253
Anna, hello.

1533
01:26:56,278 --> 01:26:57,629
John is taking a bath.

1534
01:26:58,177 --> 01:26:59,482
What's the news there?

1535
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,459
Well, here...

1536
01:27:01,484 --> 01:27:03,248
We're making <i>puttu</i> for breakfast.

1537
01:27:03,948 --> 01:27:05,714
Is it? We're having <i>puttu</i> too.

1538
01:27:05,739 --> 01:27:06,747
Oh, really?

1539
01:27:06,772 --> 01:27:08,405
What about the matter
we discussed yesterday?

1540
01:27:08,429 --> 01:27:09,476
Huh?

1541
01:27:09,501 --> 01:27:11,043
<i>Well, about our children?</i>

1542
01:27:11,521 --> 01:27:13,043
John spoke to you yesterday, right?

1543
01:27:13,068 --> 01:27:14,076
Err..

1544
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:15,418
Did you ask your daughter?

1545
01:27:15,443 --> 01:27:16,896
Err... No!

1546
01:27:18,114 --> 01:27:20,379
Elsy and I were discussing it.

1547
01:27:20,506 --> 01:27:22,341
I had told John

1548
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:24,524
that you both will be
really happy to hear this.

1549
01:27:24,568 --> 01:27:25,872
Yes, yes, yes.

1550
01:27:25,897 --> 01:27:28,318
Anyway, I'll ask John
to call you once he's done.

1551
01:27:29,147 --> 01:27:30,645
Please call back
once you speak to your daughter.

1552
01:27:30,669 --> 01:27:32,248
Sure, sure.

1553
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:41,646
What do I tell my wife now?

1554
01:27:50,584 --> 01:27:52,061
What happened?
Did you tell him?

1555
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,631
Err... well...

1556
01:27:54,815 --> 01:27:56,753
When I gave it another thought...

1557
01:27:56,935 --> 01:27:59,207
let's ask her as well.

1558
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,738
She's going to say no, for sure.

1559
01:28:00,771 --> 01:28:03,067
So, we'll have a reason
to tell them, right?

1560
01:28:04,287 --> 01:28:06,021
Isn't that what I told you earlier?

1561
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:09,090
Who managed to get that
into your thick skull now?

1562
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:11,842
- Well... I... err...
- Good morning!

1563
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,802
Oh, <i>Puttu</i> again?

1564
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:20,975
Ask her!

1565
01:28:21,591 --> 01:28:22,599
You ask her.

1566
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:25,989
What are you two mumbling about?

1567
01:28:26,311 --> 01:28:28,881
What else?
It's about your marriage, as always.

1568
01:28:28,951 --> 01:28:30,599
Oh! There you go again!

1569
01:28:31,146 --> 01:28:32,427
How long will you do this?

1570
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:34,052
What do you mean?

1571
01:28:34,326 --> 01:28:36,162
Do we have anyone else
to worry about?

1572
01:28:36,568 --> 01:28:38,521
Now you needn't rack
your brains over it.

1573
01:28:38,723 --> 01:28:40,569
You tell me, Dad!
What should I do?

1574
01:28:41,123 --> 01:28:42,590
Well,

1575
01:28:42,888 --> 01:28:44,519
you should agree to get married.

1576
01:28:44,912 --> 01:28:46,535
Okay! Agreed!

1577
01:28:46,725 --> 01:28:47,733
- Fine?
- Huh?

1578
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:55,036
What do you mean?

1579
01:28:55,756 --> 01:28:57,857
I mean that I am ready
for a marriage.

1580
01:28:58,216 --> 01:28:59,224
Huh?

1581
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:03,913
Now, tell me.
Which loser should I marry?

1582
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:05,029
Err...

1583
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,740
We have received a proposal.

1584
01:29:06,765 --> 01:29:07,773
But...

1585
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,327
there is a problem.

1586
01:29:09,468 --> 01:29:10,842
Is this how you present something?

1587
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,070
Well, what's the point
in hiding it?

1588
01:29:13,508 --> 01:29:14,515
What happened?

1589
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:16,078
Well...

1590
01:29:16,202 --> 01:29:19,054
I don't know whether
you'll like the groom's profession.

1591
01:29:19,709 --> 01:29:20,717
Why?

1592
01:29:22,718 --> 01:29:23,936
He works in advertising.

1593
01:29:24,748 --> 01:29:27,723
Oh, well! I knew that you'll bring
only such proposals anyway.

1594
01:29:28,562 --> 01:29:30,451
What's the point in me
objecting to it now?

1595
01:29:31,061 --> 01:29:32,693
Advertising it is, then!

1596
01:29:38,453 --> 01:29:39,461
But...

1597
01:29:39,648 --> 01:29:42,797
didn't you say that advertising
guys can't keep secrets?

1598
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:44,398
Well...

1599
01:29:44,748 --> 01:29:46,419
what you told me
that day was true, Dad.

1600
01:29:46,593 --> 01:29:49,053
Right from the toothbrush we use
to brush our teeth in the morning,

1601
01:29:49,077 --> 01:29:50,537
to the shampoo we use on our hair.

1602
01:29:50,617 --> 01:29:51,718
Even...

1603
01:29:51,743 --> 01:29:52,958
even this <i>puttu</i> flour.

1604
01:29:52,983 --> 01:29:54,764
They are all choices we make
from seeing ads.

1605
01:29:55,414 --> 01:29:57,811
So, I felt that
you had a point, Dad.

1606
01:29:58,529 --> 01:30:00,685
So, you no longer will
have problems from my side.

1607
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:06,180
Well, profession is okay.

1608
01:30:06,289 --> 01:30:07,296
But...

1609
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:08,890
when you know who the groom is,

1610
01:30:08,915 --> 01:30:10,366
I doubt whether you'll agree.

1611
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,328
He...

1612
01:30:14,848 --> 01:30:16,108
is a little too arrogant.

1613
01:30:16,882 --> 01:30:18,296
Can you just say it?

1614
01:30:20,326 --> 01:30:21,341
Who's that?

1615
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:23,224
My friend John's son, Eesho.

1616
01:30:28,969 --> 01:30:31,094
See! Didn't I tell you?

1617
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:33,359
She felt nauseous as soon
as she heard his name!

1618
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:35,834
My poor child!

1619
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:48,162
You don't have to drop it
just because he's not to my liking.

1620
01:30:48,187 --> 01:30:49,195
Eesho it is, then.

1621
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:51,638
But I have a condition.

1622
01:30:51,797 --> 01:30:52,805
What?

1623
01:30:53,132 --> 01:30:55,249
I don't want the wedding
immediately.

1624
01:30:57,671 --> 01:30:59,631
I need a week or two.

1625
01:30:59,656 --> 01:31:00,664
What?

1626
01:31:00,898 --> 01:31:02,195
A week or two?

1627
01:31:02,226 --> 01:31:03,835
Yeah! Even a week will do.

1628
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:08,193
Wow! It's all <i>Eesho's</i> plan.

1629
01:31:08,304 --> 01:31:08,937
Huh?

1630
01:31:08,969 --> 01:31:11,351
Well, she didn't want
to get married at all.

1631
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:14,030
Now she's saying that she wants
to get married in a week or two.

1632
01:31:14,055 --> 01:31:15,599
It's all <i>Eesho's</i> plan.

1633
01:31:15,624 --> 01:31:16,632
What else could it be?

1634
01:31:18,484 --> 01:31:20,289
Oh! That <i>Eesho</i>!

1635
01:31:21,304 --> 01:31:22,390
Sorry, <i>Eesho</i>.

1636
01:31:28,295 --> 01:31:30,249
Tell me what she said, Kurian.

1637
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:32,242
I presented the matter
to my daughter.

1638
01:31:32,398 --> 01:31:34,532
Unlike what I thought,
she didn't have much of a problem.

1639
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:35,564
But...

1640
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:36,999
let me be frank, John.

1641
01:31:37,272 --> 01:31:38,490
The problem was never hers,

1642
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:39,710
but mine!

1643
01:31:40,109 --> 01:31:41,117
Why is that?

1644
01:31:41,156 --> 01:31:42,171
Well...

1645
01:31:42,217 --> 01:31:44,803
my father struggled a lot to
establish this advertising company,

1646
01:31:44,828 --> 01:31:46,632
traveling by foot and on a cycle,

1647
01:31:46,883 --> 01:31:49,241
doing rounds of dead people's houses
to get obituary ads.

1648
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:52,327
And I have raised it to this stature
to the best of my ability.

1649
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,975
I have a wish that

1650
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,781
this company should thrive
even after my death.

1651
01:31:57,726 --> 01:32:01,061
My daughter chose a different
career path in engineering and IT.

1652
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,570
So, at least the one
who's marrying her

1653
01:32:04,749 --> 01:32:07,756
should be capable and interested
in keeping this company running.

1654
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:09,436
I really can't have
two ways about that.

1655
01:32:09,695 --> 01:32:11,788
Kurian, you have a fair point.
I understand that.

1656
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:15,476
Whatever our forefathers created
should not end up going to the dogs.

1657
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:16,914
All of us think
on the same lines.

1658
01:32:17,492 --> 01:32:18,500
If this wedding happens,

1659
01:32:18,525 --> 01:32:21,689
the very next day, he will resign
his job in Bangalore

1660
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,398
and join your company.

1661
01:32:24,015 --> 01:32:26,268
Thereafter, it will be him
managing your company.

1662
01:32:26,835 --> 01:32:27,843
But...

1663
01:32:27,867 --> 01:32:29,229
he too has to agree to it, right?

1664
01:32:30,742 --> 01:32:32,557
When Annamma gave birth to him,

1665
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:34,533
I was 24 years old.

1666
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:36,486
From then till now,

1667
01:32:36,672 --> 01:32:38,327
more than being a dad,

1668
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:39,968
I've been an elder brother to him.

1669
01:32:40,756 --> 01:32:41,903
And even more than that,

1670
01:32:41,928 --> 01:32:43,467
I've been his best friend.

1671
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,818
I will make him agree to this.

1672
01:32:47,281 --> 01:32:48,289
He will come.

1673
01:32:48,789 --> 01:32:50,328
This is Kattadi John's promise!

1674
01:32:51,616 --> 01:32:52,624
Are you sure?

1675
01:32:52,835 --> 01:32:54,053
Am I sure?

1676
01:32:54,374 --> 01:32:55,382
I am absolutely sure.

1677
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,148
Then,

1678
01:32:57,218 --> 01:32:59,835
why don't you all come home soon
at your convenience?

1679
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:02,044
It's not like we need
to ask anybody else now.

1680
01:33:02,164 --> 01:33:04,531
Why delay it?
We can come tomorrow!

1681
01:33:04,556 --> 01:33:05,672
- What?
- Yeah!

1682
01:33:05,697 --> 01:33:07,283
All of us will come there tomorrow.

1683
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:10,327
Good deeds mustn't be kept pending.

1684
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:13,695
So be it, then.

1685
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:39,917
Uncle, coffee.

1686
01:33:41,114 --> 01:33:42,253
She made it herself.

1687
01:33:44,223 --> 01:33:46,135
I don't drink coffee
at 10:30 a.m., dear.

1688
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,168
No, thanks.

1689
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:49,841
I swear!

1690
01:34:10,613 --> 01:34:11,972
I'm sure <i>you'll</i> like the coffee.

1691
01:34:15,935 --> 01:34:16,942
Wow!

1692
01:34:36,652 --> 01:34:38,425
Has it been long
since you came home?

1693
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,887
No, Aunty.
I came two days back.

1694
01:34:42,152 --> 01:34:43,394
Will you be here for a while?

1695
01:34:44,535 --> 01:34:46,339
Yes, I'll be working from home
for two weeks.

1696
01:34:50,902 --> 01:34:53,378
Eesho, you must have come
to attend the baptism, right?

1697
01:34:53,698 --> 01:34:54,706
Yes, Uncle.

1698
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:56,752
And, I had some other work as well.

1699
01:34:58,122 --> 01:35:00,238
Where is your office
in Bangalore, son?

1700
01:35:00,651 --> 01:35:02,129
It's at a place
called Windsor Circle.

1701
01:35:02,153 --> 01:35:03,697
It's close to Brigade Road.

1702
01:35:03,817 --> 01:35:04,825
Okay, okay, okay.

1703
01:35:05,190 --> 01:35:08,502
So, do you stay near your office?

1704
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,910
Around seven to eight kilometres
away from the office.

1705
01:35:11,934 --> 01:35:13,708
It's a place called Byappanahalli.

1706
01:35:15,622 --> 01:35:17,434
Are you staying alone,

1707
01:35:17,459 --> 01:35:18,925
or do you have
someone else with you?

1708
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:23,825
- Yes.
- Huh?

1709
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,278
- No... Yes... I do, right?
- No! No! Yes! Yes!

1710
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:27,404
Yes, there is someone.

1711
01:35:27,504 --> 01:35:29,123
There is someone with him.

1712
01:35:29,148 --> 01:35:30,441
It's a Bengali.

1713
01:35:31,715 --> 01:35:32,715
Beng...

1714
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:36,209
With such a long beard,
thick-framed glasses

1715
01:35:36,234 --> 01:35:38,021
and long hair.

1716
01:35:38,286 --> 01:35:40,203
It's the same person whom I met
when I came the last time, right?

1717
01:35:40,227 --> 01:35:41,589
Err... Yes!

1718
01:35:41,614 --> 01:35:43,098
He's a very creative person.

1719
01:35:43,123 --> 01:35:44,613
We can sense that
from his beard. Isn't it?

1720
01:35:44,637 --> 01:35:45,645
Yeah!

1721
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:51,554
What can we say!
Bengalis are everywhere now.

1722
01:35:51,882 --> 01:35:54,910
But yeah, it's really hard to find
a place to stay in Bangalore.

1723
01:35:54,935 --> 01:35:56,546
I had sent her to...

1724
01:35:56,571 --> 01:35:57,696
You know, right?

1725
01:35:57,770 --> 01:35:59,799
Elsy's elder sister, the nun?

1726
01:35:59,824 --> 01:36:03,155
She's the mother superior
at Ursula convent in the Vatican.

1727
01:36:03,403 --> 01:36:06,284
I arranged for Anna's stay
at the convent in Bangalore,

1728
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:08,151
using her influence.

1729
01:36:08,895 --> 01:36:11,856
The best part is that
the place has great discipline.

1730
01:36:11,881 --> 01:36:14,270
And of course
the prayers and devotion.

1731
01:36:14,513 --> 01:36:16,254
She has that too.

1732
01:36:17,847 --> 01:36:19,183
Not just that.

1733
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:21,450
After a while, she didn't
want to leave that place.

1734
01:36:21,544 --> 01:36:23,964
When we kept telling her
about different marriage proposals,

1735
01:36:23,989 --> 01:36:25,138
she kept saying no.

1736
01:36:25,163 --> 01:36:27,468
We were scared whether
she'd end up being a nun.

1737
01:36:27,847 --> 01:36:29,619
This is such a relief.

1738
01:36:32,129 --> 01:36:33,137
So...

1739
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,706
how do we take this forward?

1740
01:36:37,325 --> 01:36:39,519
Well... we fix the nearest date,

1741
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:40,789
and conduct the wedding.

1742
01:36:41,138 --> 01:36:42,609
By "nearest" you mean?

1743
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:44,568
I mean...

1744
01:36:45,137 --> 01:36:47,414
By next week
or the week after that.

1745
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:50,374
What are you saying, John?

1746
01:36:50,723 --> 01:36:51,984
She's my only daughter!

1747
01:36:52,009 --> 01:36:53,456
And he's your only child too, right?

1748
01:36:53,481 --> 01:36:55,527
Shouldn't we invite
all our relatives and friends

1749
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:56,988
and make this a grand celebration?

1750
01:36:57,816 --> 01:36:58,878
Yes, sure.

1751
01:37:00,364 --> 01:37:03,566
But, Kurian, the lent for Christmas
will start after two weeks.

1752
01:37:03,591 --> 01:37:04,972
It will be really late
after that.

1753
01:37:04,997 --> 01:37:06,082
If it is delayed too much,

1754
01:37:06,106 --> 01:37:08,214
things will grow and start showing,
isn't it?

1755
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:09,604
Oh, no! We can't do that!

1756
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:12,350
She is my younger brother
Kuttappayi's favourite niece.

1757
01:37:12,567 --> 01:37:15,051
He has said that he'll come
for her wedding from Philadelphia,

1758
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,278
come what may!

1759
01:37:16,419 --> 01:37:18,535
So, we can't do it
until the lent is over.

1760
01:37:18,691 --> 01:37:20,784
But that's quite far away, right?

1761
01:37:21,426 --> 01:37:23,933
Not so much.
It's just two months, right?

1762
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,714
Let's fix a date after that.

1763
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:27,997
It's not like I have a problem.

1764
01:37:28,286 --> 01:37:29,310
But...

1765
01:37:30,138 --> 01:37:31,645
two months will be...

1766
01:37:32,966 --> 01:37:34,714
Two plus two...

1767
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:36,016
What's wrong with that?

1768
01:37:47,302 --> 01:37:48,310
What do I say?

1769
01:37:48,335 --> 01:37:50,153
On her way from Bangalore,

1770
01:37:50,215 --> 01:37:51,675
she had a <i>vada</i> from the train.

1771
01:37:51,763 --> 01:37:52,994
It started since then.

1772
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,517
Annamma ate a <i>vada</i> too?

1773
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,308
Well...

1774
01:38:12,333 --> 01:38:14,101
if she sees someone
feeling nauseous,

1775
01:38:14,133 --> 01:38:15,813
she also feels nauseous.

1776
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:17,417
- That's why.
- Oh!

1777
01:38:39,403 --> 01:38:40,411
How are you...

1778
01:38:40,872 --> 01:38:41,880
feeling now?

1779
01:38:44,145 --> 01:38:45,153
I'm okay, Aunty.

1780
01:38:46,722 --> 01:38:47,730
How are you feeling?

1781
01:38:56,036 --> 01:38:58,160
Annamma, you're not sick
or anything, right?

1782
01:38:59,849 --> 01:39:00,856
No.

1783
01:39:00,895 --> 01:39:01,903
I am fine.

1784
01:39:02,794 --> 01:39:04,849
I was saying that...

1785
01:39:05,349 --> 01:39:07,456
there are only 16 days left
for the lent to begin.

1786
01:39:07,481 --> 01:39:08,965
So, once the lent is over,

1787
01:39:09,012 --> 01:39:11,512
we'll conduct the wedding,
one week after Christmas.

1788
01:39:11,536 --> 01:39:15,120
But we'll only have
one and a half months altogether.

1789
01:39:15,145 --> 01:39:16,730
Isn't that too close a date?

1790
01:39:16,755 --> 01:39:18,324
Yeah, that's what I said.

1791
01:39:18,349 --> 01:39:19,957
Let's hand this over to someone.

1792
01:39:20,331 --> 01:39:21,580
Hand this over to someone?

1793
01:39:21,997 --> 01:39:24,776
The team that conducted
our Doctor's daughter's wedding?

1794
01:39:24,801 --> 01:39:26,340
Wasn't that an awesome function?

1795
01:39:26,988 --> 01:39:28,526
Yes, that was a great function.

1796
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:31,097
It was conducted by
an event management company.

1797
01:39:31,137 --> 01:39:32,785
They will stay
until the wedding is over,

1798
01:39:32,801 --> 01:39:34,667
wash the plates
and remove the stage too.

1799
01:39:34,691 --> 01:39:36,275
We needn't be stressed
about anything.

1800
01:39:36,745 --> 01:39:38,597
That's nice.
That's really nice.

1801
01:39:38,854 --> 01:39:40,663
So, let's give it to them, right?

1802
01:39:41,212 --> 01:39:42,214
We'll do that.

1803
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,140
Since I made a timely intervention,

1804
01:40:00,165 --> 01:40:01,631
everything went smoothly.

1805
01:40:01,656 --> 01:40:02,664
"Timely intervention."

1806
01:40:02,695 --> 01:40:04,124
You were really over the top, John.

1807
01:40:04,429 --> 01:40:05,889
Bengali with a beard, it seems.

1808
01:40:06,116 --> 01:40:07,373
Couldn't you think
of anything else?

1809
01:40:07,397 --> 01:40:09,256
I was scared
if you'd ruin everything

1810
01:40:09,272 --> 01:40:10,749
by going way overboard.

1811
01:40:10,804 --> 01:40:13,225
You heard that?
He's saying I ruined everything.

1812
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:14,812
You heard him, right?

1813
01:40:15,234 --> 01:40:17,163
As if everything he did
was really decent.

1814
01:40:17,507 --> 01:40:19,318
Yes, I deserve to hear this.

1815
01:40:19,515 --> 01:40:20,898
Don't say anything, <i>ichaya</i>.

1816
01:40:20,984 --> 01:40:22,318
You were quite
over the top today.

1817
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:24,631
You don't quite know how to act.

1818
01:40:24,656 --> 01:40:26,162
You're also supporting him, huh?

1819
01:40:26,773 --> 01:40:29,190
When you also went off
to vomit right behind her,

1820
01:40:29,222 --> 01:40:30,745
everything was going kaput.

1821
01:40:31,554 --> 01:40:34,139
Since I came up with a story
at the right time,

1822
01:40:34,164 --> 01:40:35,670
no one suspected anything.

1823
01:40:35,695 --> 01:40:36,703
Did they?

1824
01:40:37,062 --> 01:40:38,582
Did they suspect anything?
You tell me!

1825
01:40:40,233 --> 01:40:42,818
What did you say
you had from the train?

1826
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:53,626
Lent for 25 days means...

1827
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:56,482
altogether one and a half
months more.

1828
01:40:56,659 --> 01:40:59,339
How's it during the fourth month?
Will people be able to find out?

1829
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:00,901
Don't you know that?

1830
01:41:01,536 --> 01:41:03,371
When I was four months
pregnant with him,

1831
01:41:03,396 --> 01:41:06,417
people used to ask me
whether my date was due.

1832
01:41:06,481 --> 01:41:07,587
But this guy...

1833
01:41:07,612 --> 01:41:08,720
is a big bull!

1834
01:41:09,692 --> 01:41:11,401
He was 4.25 kilos heavy
when he was born.

1835
01:41:11,426 --> 01:41:13,050
- 4.5 kilos!
- Oh, yeah! 4.5 kilos!

1836
01:41:13,582 --> 01:41:14,949
Will every child be like that?

1837
01:41:18,019 --> 01:41:19,743
There won't be any problem.

1838
01:41:20,246 --> 01:41:22,135
Let's give her a really tight sari

1839
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,604
and make her wear a lot of gold
to hide the tummy.

1840
01:41:25,495 --> 01:41:26,610
People won't find out.

1841
01:41:31,871 --> 01:41:32,879
Yes, Anna?

1842
01:41:34,299 --> 01:41:35,315
Eesho, Mom found out.

1843
01:41:41,167 --> 01:41:44,175
But everything went smooth, right?

1844
01:41:44,402 --> 01:41:45,745
What went wrong after that?

1845
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:48,557
Didn't I tell you already
that you were really over the top?

1846
01:41:48,582 --> 01:41:50,065
No... Can't be...

1847
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:51,098
This is something else.

1848
01:41:52,942 --> 01:41:53,942
Hey!

1849
01:41:55,348 --> 01:41:56,356
Look!

1850
01:41:56,925 --> 01:41:57,933
Kurian is calling.

1851
01:41:59,485 --> 01:42:01,217
This will be an issue.
A huge issue!

1852
01:42:01,242 --> 01:42:02,880
- You answer the call.
- Me? I won't answer it.

1853
01:42:02,889 --> 01:42:03,740
Then?

1854
01:42:03,764 --> 01:42:05,633
Did I create this mess?

1855
01:42:05,914 --> 01:42:07,381
It's not like what you think.

1856
01:42:07,414 --> 01:42:08,975
This will be a huge issue!

1857
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,008
Answer the call!

1858
01:42:10,396 --> 01:42:12,255
I won't answer it.
He's your best friend, right?

1859
01:42:12,271 --> 01:42:13,336
You answer the call!

1860
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,820
Annamma, you answer it.
Here you go.

1861
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:16,897
<i>Ichaya,</i> answer the call!

1862
01:42:17,922 --> 01:42:18,930
Come on!

1863
01:42:20,633 --> 01:42:21,990
- Hello?
<i>- John.</i>

1864
01:42:22,827 --> 01:42:23,835
Hello?

1865
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:25,187
<i>Where have you reached?</i>

1866
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,037
We're halfway through.

1867
01:42:28,805 --> 01:42:29,867
Kurian!

1868
01:42:30,186 --> 01:42:33,630
You should do one thing.
You should listen to me peacefully.

1869
01:42:33,813 --> 01:42:35,021
<i>Don't say anything more.</i>

1870
01:42:35,179 --> 01:42:37,067
<i>You should come to town
police station tomorrow.</i>

1871
01:42:37,641 --> 01:42:41,098
Kurian, please listen
to me peacefully.

1872
01:42:41,123 --> 01:42:43,124
We can't keep this for later.

1873
01:42:43,149 --> 01:42:44,880
We have only one
and a half months!

1874
01:42:44,938 --> 01:42:47,458
<i>We should meet them
and fix everything immediately.</i>

1875
01:42:47,664 --> 01:42:50,232
<i>Just come near that police station
tomorrow and call me.</i>

1876
01:42:50,508 --> 01:42:52,318
Their office is somewhere
near that station.

1877
01:42:53,711 --> 01:42:55,639
- Whose?
<i>- Didn't I tell you earlier?</i>

1878
01:42:55,664 --> 01:42:57,265
That event management company?

1879
01:42:57,602 --> 01:42:59,015
<i>I had called them now.</i>

1880
01:42:59,266 --> 01:43:00,733
<i>We can meet them
if we go tomorrow.</i>

1881
01:43:00,843 --> 01:43:03,224
<i>We should finalise
everything tomorrow itself.</i>

1882
01:43:03,538 --> 01:43:04,546
Them?

1883
01:43:04,587 --> 01:43:08,617
Well, Elsy is saying now
that we shouldn't delay it at all.

1884
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:13,288
So, Elsy and Anna?

1885
01:43:13,313 --> 01:43:15,179
Yes. I asked them.

1886
01:43:15,328 --> 01:43:16,608
They are okay with it.

1887
01:43:16,633 --> 01:43:17,844
They are right next to me.

1888
01:43:17,883 --> 01:43:19,693
So, we'll meet tomorrow.
Okay?

1889
01:43:19,718 --> 01:43:20,976
See you tomorrow.

1890
01:43:22,523 --> 01:43:23,839
- John, you are..
- I'll hit you!

1891
01:43:27,771 --> 01:43:28,986
This is weird.

1892
01:43:31,578 --> 01:43:33,245
Something has happened
over there.

1893
01:43:33,461 --> 01:43:34,870
Something we don't know.

1894
01:43:34,937 --> 01:43:36,825
Wait a minute!
Until they left,

1895
01:43:36,865 --> 01:43:38,779
you were saying that your brother
has to come from America,

1896
01:43:38,803 --> 01:43:40,740
your nephew has to come
from Italy... and so on.

1897
01:43:40,938 --> 01:43:42,037
And as soon as they left,

1898
01:43:42,062 --> 01:43:43,579
you're saying that
we shouldn't delay it at all

1899
01:43:43,603 --> 01:43:45,079
and do it right away.

1900
01:43:45,149 --> 01:43:47,096
Make up your mind for once.

1901
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:49,483
Well, if you're all in such a hurry,

1902
01:43:49,508 --> 01:43:51,225
why should I be the odd one out?

1903
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:55,967
♪ Marriage is all hunky-dory
In the beginning ♪

1904
01:43:55,992 --> 01:43:59,945
♪ Life goes downhill thereafter ♪

1905
01:44:00,078 --> 01:44:02,142
♪ A cage for the green bird... ♪

1906
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,976
If he comes to know about this,

1907
01:44:04,172 --> 01:44:05,773
I can't even imagine
what will happen.

1908
01:44:06,133 --> 01:44:07,890
Even when he kept saying no,

1909
01:44:08,055 --> 01:44:10,562
I was the one who compelled
him for this alliance the most.

1910
01:44:10,765 --> 01:44:11,773
Mummy!

1911
01:44:12,429 --> 01:44:13,437
Shut up!

1912
01:44:13,594 --> 01:44:14,804
I'll give you one tight slap!

1913
01:44:15,274 --> 01:44:18,804
If he figures this out
before the wedding,

1914
01:44:18,898 --> 01:44:21,507
he'll dig a grave outside our house
and bury the two of us there.

1915
01:44:21,532 --> 01:44:22,540
- Elsy!
- Yes!

1916
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:35,799
<i>Ichaya!</i>

1917
01:44:36,227 --> 01:44:37,245
How many have you had?

1918
01:44:38,436 --> 01:44:39,663
It's just my sixth drink!

1919
01:44:39,928 --> 01:44:40,905
Sixth?

1920
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:42,773
If not today, then when?

1921
01:44:42,828 --> 01:44:45,125
It's the day we fixed
our daughter's wedding!

1922
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:47,304
That, too, to a groom
just like we wished for!

1923
01:44:47,329 --> 01:44:48,423
I mean,

1924
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:50,157
a groom just like I wished for!

1925
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:53,273
Do you know where he's working?

1926
01:44:53,648 --> 01:44:55,397
He works for a huge
multinational company.

1927
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,224
We can't dream of hiring someone
from there for our company.

1928
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:00,794
You should see the awards
he has won.

1929
01:45:00,819 --> 01:45:02,537
We can't even pronounce the names!

1930
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:03,577
Well...

1931
01:45:03,602 --> 01:45:06,045
you were not so fond
of him initially, right?

1932
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:07,124
I mean,

1933
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:09,342
initially I thought that
he won't join our company.

1934
01:45:09,367 --> 01:45:11,091
Later, John promised me

1935
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:13,451
that, the very next day
after the wedding,

1936
01:45:13,537 --> 01:45:15,256
Eesho will join our company.

1937
01:45:15,459 --> 01:45:16,646
You know what that means?

1938
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:18,842
Our business will skyrocket!

1939
01:45:19,014 --> 01:45:20,534
Dr. Samuel had called
sometime back.

1940
01:45:20,559 --> 01:45:22,503
It's a business deal worth
around Rs. 25 crore.

1941
01:45:22,538 --> 01:45:23,693
If Eesho is with us,

1942
01:45:23,725 --> 01:45:25,301
we can win that deal easily.

1943
01:45:25,411 --> 01:45:26,443
Oh!

1944
01:45:26,631 --> 01:45:28,178
So, that's your big plan.

1945
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:31,566
I just hope everything
goes according to plan.

1946
01:45:31,708 --> 01:45:33,194
Everything will.

1947
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:34,443
Wait and watch.

1948
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:36,778
- How about a drink?
- No.

1949
01:45:37,044 --> 01:45:38,177
I'm going to bed.

1950
01:45:38,427 --> 01:45:39,435
Okay!

1951
01:45:39,897 --> 01:45:41,537
Good night, sweetheart!

1952
01:45:41,562 --> 01:45:42,562
Yeah, yeah.

1953
01:46:11,678 --> 01:46:14,374
Done!
Anything, anytime, anywhere!

1954
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:15,411
I am Happy.

1955
01:46:15,443 --> 01:46:16,474
We're also happy.

1956
01:46:16,499 --> 01:46:17,941
Sir, I was telling you my name.

1957
01:46:18,014 --> 01:46:19,599
I am Happy.
Happy Pinto.

1958
01:46:19,624 --> 01:46:20,631
Oh!

1959
01:46:21,748 --> 01:46:25,134
I mean... anything, anytime,
anywhere, we'll get it done.

1960
01:46:25,514 --> 01:46:26,522
If it's for a wedding,

1961
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:27,982
you should bring
the bride and groom.

1962
01:46:28,006 --> 01:46:29,014
We can't provide that.

1963
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:30,381
But your role ends there.

1964
01:46:30,406 --> 01:46:31,764
We'll get everything else done.

1965
01:46:31,789 --> 01:46:33,015
We'll start with
the wedding invites.

1966
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:34,507
Everything will follow
one color theme.

1967
01:46:34,531 --> 01:46:37,896
The color of the sari, the suit,
counter and even the flowers...

1968
01:46:37,957 --> 01:46:39,708
Everything will have
the same color theme,

1969
01:46:39,724 --> 01:46:40,631
even the juice.

1970
01:46:40,655 --> 01:46:42,956
And then, the little kids,
elder sisters, younger sisters,

1971
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:44,770
elder brothers,
younger brothers, aunties...

1972
01:46:44,795 --> 01:46:47,294
Why, even you will be
under our surveillance.

1973
01:46:48,201 --> 01:46:49,965
- Us?
- I mean, sir...

1974
01:46:50,043 --> 01:46:53,230
Everyone will dress according
to the dress code assigned by us.

1975
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,049
- How's that?
- Oh! Like that!

1976
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:56,089
And then, the food!

1977
01:46:56,113 --> 01:46:57,396
My mouth is watering
at the very thought of it.

1978
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:00,646
Street food, South Indian,
North Indian, Arabic, Chinese,

1979
01:47:00,703 --> 01:47:02,162
Continental, Uganda!

1980
01:47:02,187 --> 01:47:03,248
Uganda?

1981
01:47:03,273 --> 01:47:04,654
Yes, Uganda.
It's the latest trend.

1982
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:06,233
The chef will come from Kenya.

1983
01:47:06,258 --> 01:47:07,453
And then, the stage.

1984
01:47:07,478 --> 01:47:10,693
Houseboat, ship, train,
airport, secretariat,

1985
01:47:10,718 --> 01:47:12,740
Parliament, White House,
Beemapally...

1986
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,646
Not Beemapally.
I mean, Taj Mahal.

1987
01:47:14,671 --> 01:47:16,777
I have 3D models of all these.
I can show them all.

1988
01:47:17,349 --> 01:47:18,356
I'll show you everything.

1989
01:47:19,301 --> 01:47:21,394
I have another item as well.
Shall I show it?

1990
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,498
Call them.

1991
01:47:22,684 --> 01:47:23,684
Boys!

1992
01:47:36,248 --> 01:47:37,448
[IN HINDI] Give them a salute.

1993
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,293
- Salute!
- [IN HINDI] Yes, sir!

1994
01:47:39,318 --> 01:47:40,318
Oh, my God!

1995
01:47:44,428 --> 01:47:45,926
It's okay.
It's only once in a while.

1996
01:47:45,951 --> 01:47:46,959
How's it?

1997
01:47:46,984 --> 01:47:47,992
What? The salute?

1998
01:47:48,017 --> 01:47:49,025
On the whole?

1999
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:50,597
Isn't it quite overboard
on the whole?

2000
01:47:50,622 --> 01:47:52,395
We should go overboard, sir.
We should go way overboard!

2001
01:47:52,419 --> 01:47:54,301
Why else are you getting
your children married?

2002
01:47:54,722 --> 01:47:56,379
Isn't that so?

2003
01:47:56,668 --> 01:47:58,574
We brought them in a truck
from Jaipur.

2004
01:47:58,676 --> 01:48:00,597
They are our latest attraction.
We haven't used them yet.

2005
01:48:00,621 --> 01:48:03,229
There are eight people like them.
They will be building our stage.

2006
01:48:03,254 --> 01:48:04,254
Oops. Sorry.

2007
01:48:04,348 --> 01:48:06,590
I mean, they will be sprinkling
rose water on the stage.

2008
01:48:06,637 --> 01:48:07,785
I got confused.

2009
01:48:07,888 --> 01:48:09,387
[IN HINDI] Go! Go! Go inside!

2010
01:48:09,826 --> 01:48:11,582
- Go!
- Don't hit your head on the ceiling.

2011
01:48:11,669 --> 01:48:12,669
Bend down!

2012
01:48:12,694 --> 01:48:14,372
- Have food!
- Yes, sir!

2013
01:48:16,456 --> 01:48:18,059
They are high maintenance.
Quite expensive.

2014
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:19,083
Please don't mind.

2015
01:48:19,634 --> 01:48:20,812
So, that was it about humans.

2016
01:48:20,837 --> 01:48:21,978
Now, let's get to the animals.

2017
01:48:22,002 --> 01:48:24,011
Horse, elephant, camel, zebra.
Which one do you want?

2018
01:48:24,035 --> 01:48:25,221
- Zebra?
- Zebra?

2019
01:48:25,246 --> 01:48:27,103
- Yes.
- Who said zebra? Me?

2020
01:48:27,128 --> 01:48:28,549
- Yeah!
- Oops. We don't need zebras, sir.

2021
01:48:28,573 --> 01:48:30,103
Zebras might be
even more expensive.

2022
01:48:30,128 --> 01:48:31,956
Plus, we'll have to bring them
from Johannesburg.

2023
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,581
Let's go with camels.
They can be arranged from Dubai.

2024
01:48:34,939 --> 01:48:36,531
We can get them
from Rajasthan too.

2025
01:48:36,556 --> 01:48:38,235
But they'll be skinny and ugly.

2026
01:48:38,329 --> 01:48:39,913
- Why do we need camels?
- Very simple.

2027
01:48:40,016 --> 01:48:41,966
The newly-weds will come
to the reception,

2028
01:48:41,991 --> 01:48:43,084
riding on a camel.

2029
01:48:43,138 --> 01:48:46,208
Riding and shaking like this
in slow motion.

2030
01:48:46,233 --> 01:48:49,363
Hell no! Nope, no camels.

2031
01:48:49,388 --> 01:48:51,883
They will... err... shake a lot.
We don't need that.

2032
01:48:52,001 --> 01:48:53,477
- No camels?
- No! No!

2033
01:48:53,559 --> 01:48:55,317
Let me think of options.
Cat, dog, duck, python...

2034
01:48:55,341 --> 01:48:56,734
What we need first...

2035
01:48:56,759 --> 01:48:58,063
is an invitation card.

2036
01:48:58,088 --> 01:48:59,821
Sheesh! Those are all
out of fashion, sir.

2037
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:01,321
Pre-wedding shoots are popular now.

2038
01:49:01,345 --> 01:49:02,220
Pre?

2039
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:03,680
Ah! I'll show you!

2040
01:49:03,705 --> 01:49:04,807
It's trending now.

2041
01:49:04,832 --> 01:49:06,214
They are really unique.

2042
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:07,681
So interesting!

2043
01:49:07,804 --> 01:49:09,496
You'll die laughing
if you see them.

2044
01:49:09,629 --> 01:49:10,800
Check this out.

2045
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:13,536
This is a photo where
they're lying in the marshlands.

2046
01:49:14,846 --> 01:49:17,291
Did you see all that sludge?
It's all original.

2047
01:49:18,142 --> 01:49:20,977
Look! The newly-weds rising up
from a 40-feet deep well.

2048
01:49:21,002 --> 01:49:23,909
If the rope breaks, they're done for.
We'll die laughing, seeing them.

2049
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:26,053
Wow! This is a fire escape.

2050
01:49:26,411 --> 01:49:27,686
Fire escape?

2051
01:49:27,718 --> 01:49:29,748
Oh! We took so much risk
to shoot this, sir.

2052
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,940
Are these people still alive?

2053
01:49:32,113 --> 01:49:33,120
Who?

2054
01:49:33,145 --> 01:49:35,459
They... Are they still alive?

2055
01:49:35,538 --> 01:49:36,538
Are they?

2056
01:49:36,585 --> 01:49:40,147
They... must be... right?

2057
01:49:41,267 --> 01:49:43,220
They are alive, sir.

2058
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:44,444
They should be.

2059
01:49:45,219 --> 01:49:47,178
They haven't called me
after this, though.

2060
01:49:48,117 --> 01:49:50,132
Sometimes, it's like this...

2061
01:49:50,164 --> 01:49:51,953
Their payments are still pending.

2062
01:49:53,797 --> 01:49:54,929
Impressed?

2063
01:49:55,867 --> 01:49:57,297
Bye, bye!
Bye, bye, sir!

2064
01:50:00,686 --> 01:50:03,006
We don't have much time.
We need to start work immediately.

2065
01:50:03,233 --> 01:50:04,415
Good clients, right?

2066
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,986
Both of them are filthy rich.

2067
01:50:05,995 --> 01:50:08,080
We should squeeze the last
penny out of them!

2068
01:50:08,104 --> 01:50:11,117
That's all good, but our camel plan
didn't work out.

2069
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,143
I thought so too. They didn't buy
what I said about the camel.

2070
01:50:14,168 --> 01:50:15,843
It's not that. We had fed it
some biryani

2071
01:50:15,868 --> 01:50:17,782
during the inauguration
of Altaf's Mandi restaurant.

2072
01:50:17,806 --> 01:50:19,267
It hasn't had any food
after that.

2073
01:50:19,335 --> 01:50:21,707
Will anyone feed biryani to camels?
Aren't they vegetarians?

2074
01:50:21,732 --> 01:50:24,191
It's not that.
It's the climate here.

2075
01:50:24,216 --> 01:50:26,169
What's wrong with the climate?
The camels should be happy.

2076
01:50:26,193 --> 01:50:27,286
It's not as hot as Dubai here.

2077
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,348
- But they prefer the heat.
- Yeah?

2078
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:31,616
And yeah, one of them
is almost done for.

2079
01:50:34,521 --> 01:50:36,184
What do we do?

2080
01:50:42,067 --> 01:50:43,191
- Hello?
- Hello, sir?

2081
01:50:43,255 --> 01:50:44,794
- I am Happy.
<i>- We are happy too.</i>

2082
01:50:44,827 --> 01:50:45,598
I know, sir.

2083
01:50:45,623 --> 01:50:48,653
Sir, won't there be an engagement
before the wedding?

2084
01:50:48,678 --> 01:50:49,819
So, on the previous day..

2085
01:50:49,835 --> 01:50:51,374
I was just talking to the chef.

2086
01:50:51,528 --> 01:50:53,122
We can serve a special
Arabic item, sir.

2087
01:50:53,153 --> 01:50:54,302
- Camel biryani.
- Huh?

2088
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:57,411
- Camel?
- Yes, sir. It's an awesome dish!

2089
01:50:57,591 --> 01:50:59,097
It's really good
Arabic biryani, sir.

2090
01:50:59,276 --> 01:51:01,307
Please save me, sir.

2091
01:51:01,332 --> 01:51:03,292
I mean, please trust me.
It will be really good.

2092
01:51:03,317 --> 01:51:05,051
Ah! Camel or whatever!

2093
01:51:05,192 --> 01:51:08,129
It's about the food, right?
No one should have any complaints.

2094
01:51:08,201 --> 01:51:09,629
<i>Everything should be amazing.</i>

2095
01:51:09,797 --> 01:51:11,781
- Okay sir. Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

2096
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,531
- Safe journey.

2145
01:57:04,235 --> 01:57:05,235
So, Uncle...

2146
01:57:05,594 --> 01:57:06,602
This is our prototype.

2147
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:09,524
We will modify our hospital
in Kochi first.

2148
01:57:09,992 --> 01:57:11,671
The work for that will begin
in one week.

2149
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:14,687
These are the under-construction
designs in the other cities.

2150
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:17,086
Impressive!
It will be really good.

2151
01:57:17,585 --> 01:57:18,865
So basically, Uncle...

2152
01:57:18,992 --> 01:57:21,593
For branding and
communication alone,

2153
01:57:21,984 --> 01:57:24,107
we've set aside Rs. 25-30 crore.

2154
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:26,951
So, what we expect from you

2155
01:57:26,976 --> 01:57:30,030
is a clear idea on branding
and communication approach,

2156
01:57:30,327 --> 01:57:31,726
a marketing strategy,

2157
01:57:32,038 --> 01:57:33,046
and of course,

2158
01:57:33,539 --> 01:57:34,671
the new look of the brand.

2159
01:57:35,086 --> 01:57:36,601
I'll share the brief
with your team.

2160
01:57:36,904 --> 01:57:37,942
Kurian, as I told you,

2161
01:57:37,966 --> 01:57:39,858
I'll just be watching
from the gallery

2162
01:57:39,938 --> 01:57:42,516
because I don't have
any idea about all this.

2163
01:57:42,547 --> 01:57:44,562
So, my involvement
will also be limited.

2164
01:57:44,688 --> 01:57:47,867
In short, Cyril will be taking
all the decisions.

2165
01:57:48,086 --> 01:57:50,109
I will also be watching
the game from the gallery.

2166
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,782
You've handed it over
to your son-in-law.

2167
01:57:51,806 --> 01:57:53,156
I have done the same.

2168
01:57:53,812 --> 01:57:56,334
The one presenting the concept
to your son-in-law

2169
01:57:56,359 --> 01:57:57,367
won't be me.

2170
01:57:57,477 --> 01:57:58,485
It will be my son-in-law.

2171
01:57:59,342 --> 01:58:01,490
- Who? Our...
- Exactly.

2172
01:58:01,687 --> 01:58:03,593
John's son, Eesho.

2173
01:58:03,811 --> 01:58:05,047
Uncle John's...

2174
01:58:05,586 --> 01:58:06,882
You mean Eesho Kattadi?

2175
01:58:07,413 --> 01:58:08,421
Really?

2176
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:09,508
Then, we're sorted!

2177
01:58:11,836 --> 01:58:14,639
Eesho is one of the most sought-after
creative directors in India.

2178
01:58:15,125 --> 01:58:16,638
And if he's heading
the campaign,

2179
01:58:17,452 --> 01:58:19,499
I don't have to think
of another option.

2180
01:58:19,726 --> 01:58:20,733
I'm in!

2181
01:58:21,649 --> 01:58:23,136
Don't worry at all, Doctor.

2182
01:58:23,422 --> 01:58:24,573
We will rock this!

2183
01:58:25,079 --> 01:58:26,237
What are you saying, John?

2184
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,329
You can't just make
promises like that!

2185
01:58:28,502 --> 01:58:30,186
I've come here on a leave
of three weeks.

2186
01:58:30,211 --> 01:58:32,226
Once I get back,
I have to go for a shoot in Prague.

2187
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:34,044
What? You're going
to shoot a frog?

2188
01:58:34,069 --> 01:58:35,132
"Prague!"

2189
01:58:35,157 --> 01:58:37,352
It's a place.
It's a huge opportunity!

2190
01:58:37,489 --> 01:58:38,904
After that,
I'll get the salary I ask for

2191
01:58:38,928 --> 01:58:40,305
and a share in the company!

2192
01:58:40,329 --> 01:58:41,716
And you've gone ahead and promised

2193
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:43,444
that I'll work in
this godforsaken place?

2194
01:58:43,468 --> 01:58:45,429
Eesho, you should
understand something.

2195
01:58:45,819 --> 01:58:48,100
After eight months,
you'll be the father of a child.

2196
01:58:48,648 --> 01:58:50,686
Once you have children,
you should be at home.

2197
01:58:50,773 --> 01:58:53,617
Do we need to make money
by gallivanting around the world?

2198
01:58:54,264 --> 01:58:55,757
Each person has his own interests!

2199
01:58:55,782 --> 01:58:57,672
Did you ask me even once
before giving him your word?

2200
01:58:57,696 --> 01:58:58,704
Oh! Is that so?

2201
01:58:59,368 --> 01:59:00,623
Did you ask me before...

2202
01:59:00,766 --> 01:59:01,930
doing all this?

2203
01:59:02,351 --> 01:59:04,827
What is it, <i>ichaya</i>?
What's the problem?

2204
01:59:04,851 --> 01:59:07,422
I'm trying to solve
all this somehow, and...

2205
01:59:08,165 --> 01:59:09,241
Let me tell you something.

2206
01:59:09,266 --> 01:59:11,812
He has agreed to this wedding
only because I made this promise.

2207
01:59:12,461 --> 01:59:13,788
I have given him my word.

2208
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:15,258
I can't go back on it,
come what may.

2209
01:59:15,639 --> 01:59:17,162
You should go
and meet him tomorrow.

2210
01:59:17,187 --> 01:59:19,391
He has a huge project coming up.
You should do it for him.

2211
01:59:19,415 --> 01:59:21,226
And after the wedding,
you should settle down here.

2212
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,912
You gave him your word, not me.

2213
01:59:24,086 --> 01:59:25,802
Kattadi John is a man of his word.

2214
01:59:26,313 --> 01:59:28,094
I can't go back on my word.

2215
01:59:28,172 --> 01:59:29,469
You needn't go back on your word.

2216
01:59:29,493 --> 01:59:30,508
I will talk to Anna.

2217
01:59:30,533 --> 01:59:32,359
You don't know Kurian well enough.

2218
01:59:33,031 --> 01:59:35,187
What will he do?
He won't eat me, right?

2219
01:59:35,414 --> 01:59:38,094
Every now and then, you keep saying
I don't know Kurian well enough.

2220
01:59:38,281 --> 01:59:39,289
As if I am...

2221
01:59:40,071 --> 01:59:42,399
Will the child in your womb
also turn out to be like this?

2222
01:59:43,233 --> 01:59:44,943
Don't think I can handle that!

2223
02:00:04,154 --> 02:00:05,165
Hello?

2224
02:00:05,211 --> 02:00:06,865
Sir, how about a falooda?

2225
02:00:06,891 --> 02:00:07,899
Huh? What?

2226
02:00:08,029 --> 02:00:10,693
Sir, shall we serve falooda
as a special dessert?

2227
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:11,968
Lebanese falooda.

2228
02:00:12,062 --> 02:00:13,070
It's a special item.

2229
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:14,811
It's really good
for digestion, sir.

2230
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:17,841
Next morning,
the floodgates will open.

2231
02:00:17,929 --> 02:00:20,210
Is there any way I could get
one of those right now?

2232
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:21,805
- Now?
<i>- Yes.</i>

2233
02:00:22,328 --> 02:00:24,703
- Now...
- Forget it! Fine!

2234
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,125
Do whatever is necessary.

2235
02:00:26,289 --> 02:00:28,031
No one should have
any complaints.

2236
02:00:28,056 --> 02:00:29,611
No, sir. We'll make sure
that does not happen.

2237
02:00:29,635 --> 02:00:30,643
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

2238
02:00:31,517 --> 02:00:32,517
Phew!

2239
02:00:32,749 --> 02:00:34,217
That sounded so tempting.

2240
02:00:45,368 --> 02:00:46,532
How did it go?

2241
02:00:46,557 --> 02:00:48,290
Oh, well, it did not.

2242
02:00:48,315 --> 02:00:49,610
Shall I do something?

2243
02:00:49,681 --> 02:00:51,635
Shall I prepare the concoction
that my sister suggested?

2244
02:00:51,659 --> 02:00:52,704
What concoction?

2245
02:00:53,431 --> 02:00:55,970
Twenty-five gooseberries dried
in moderate sunlight

2246
02:00:55,995 --> 02:00:58,109
along with rock salt
and turmeric powder.

2247
02:00:58,134 --> 02:01:00,531
She has given me a long list
of ingredients.

2248
02:01:00,556 --> 02:01:02,243
I have already dried
the gooseberries too.

2249
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:03,711
If you drink one glass of that,

2250
02:01:03,736 --> 02:01:05,376
your constipation will be gone.

2251
02:01:05,555 --> 02:01:07,032
I'll drink whatever
you want me to drink.

2252
02:01:07,056 --> 02:01:09,313
I have to get so many things done
after this.

2253
02:01:09,338 --> 02:01:10,939
I'll bring it quickly then.

2254
02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:14,127
Hey! Where is she?

2255
02:01:17,275 --> 02:01:18,283
Seventeen...

2256
02:01:19,305 --> 02:01:20,313
Oops.

2257
02:01:20,345 --> 02:01:23,084
Listen, don't make it too tight
around my stomach.

2258
02:01:23,524 --> 02:01:24,532
Okay, okay.

2259
02:01:25,776 --> 02:01:27,398
- Just a minute.
- Okay.

2260
02:01:29,166 --> 02:01:30,174
Hey, note that down.

2261
02:01:30,736 --> 02:01:32,377
- Yes, Eesho.
- Anna...

2262
02:01:33,009 --> 02:01:34,346
I have to tell you something.

2263
02:01:40,024 --> 02:01:43,344
Eesho, you are always talking
about <i>your</i> job and career.

2264
02:01:43,431 --> 02:01:44,852
Have you ever thought about me?

2265
02:01:45,321 --> 02:01:46,520
I don't want to hear anything!

2266
02:01:46,544 --> 02:01:48,446
You have to hold on at least
until the wedding gets done.

2267
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:50,285
Anna, please try to understand.

2268
02:01:50,431 --> 02:01:51,821
If you can't say it,
you don't have to.

2269
02:01:51,845 --> 02:01:52,926
I'll talk to your dad.

2270
02:01:54,673 --> 02:01:55,681
Do whatever you want.

2271
02:01:56,072 --> 02:01:57,080
Anna?

2272
02:02:14,674 --> 02:02:16,575
- Hello?
- <i>Achaya,</i> this is Jameskutty.

2273
02:02:16,793 --> 02:02:17,800
What is it, James?

2274
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,713
I've called you to tell you
something urgently.

2275
02:02:19,793 --> 02:02:22,826
I'm in the middle of something
even more urgent.

2276
02:02:22,851 --> 02:02:23,999
Call me later.

2277
02:02:24,024 --> 02:02:26,026
No, <i>Achaya.</i>
This is an emergency.

2278
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:27,168
Tell me, then.

2279
02:02:27,316 --> 02:02:28,994
Our Anna's groom?

2280
02:02:29,019 --> 02:02:30,027
Who?

2281
02:02:30,052 --> 02:02:32,322
<i>The guy who's going to marry Anna?
Eesho?</i>

2282
02:02:32,379 --> 02:02:34,983
Even if you asked me to or not,
it is my duty, right?

2283
02:02:35,191 --> 02:02:38,284
So, since I am in Bangalore,
I made an enquiry about him.

2284
02:02:38,441 --> 02:02:39,449
So?

2285
02:02:39,902 --> 02:02:41,808
He has a small set-up here.

2286
02:02:41,956 --> 02:02:43,511
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

2287
02:02:43,536 --> 02:02:46,870
he was living together with a girl,
here at Kammanahalli.

2288
02:02:48,722 --> 02:02:49,730
Moreover,

2289
02:02:49,755 --> 02:02:51,944
that girl who was with him
got pregnant too.

2290
02:02:52,832 --> 02:02:54,186
What are you saying?

2291
02:02:54,518 --> 02:02:55,526
Yes!

2292
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:58,487
And your friend, Mr. John?
That guy's father?

2293
02:02:58,667 --> 02:03:01,027
I heard that he came here
personally to settle the issue,

2294
02:03:01,058 --> 02:03:02,775
<i>and then packed the girl off.</i>

2295
02:03:03,581 --> 02:03:06,251
Though it's a little late now,
I have told you what I had to.

2296
02:03:07,191 --> 02:03:08,199
Hey!

2297
02:03:08,433 --> 02:03:09,995
Is this the truth?

2298
02:03:10,543 --> 02:03:12,425
- Are you sure?
- I am sure, <i>Achaya</i>.

2299
02:03:12,667 --> 02:03:14,511
This is from a very reliable source.

2300
02:03:35,004 --> 02:03:36,011
How is it, Dad?

2301
02:03:38,527 --> 02:03:40,897
Wow! You look so pretty!

2302
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:45,275
Look, <i>ichaya.</i>
It's really nice, right?

2303
02:03:46,706 --> 02:03:48,313
You don't need this dress anymore.

2304
02:03:51,613 --> 02:03:53,321
What happened?
It didn't work?

2305
02:03:56,910 --> 02:03:59,339
<i>Ichaya,</i> what is it? What happened?

2306
02:03:59,987 --> 02:04:02,651
Don't you get me started!

2307
02:04:03,011 --> 02:04:04,205
But that can't be!

2308
02:04:04,245 --> 02:04:05,989
I was told that one glass
of the concoction

2309
02:04:06,013 --> 02:04:07,521
will definitely work wonders.

2310
02:04:08,175 --> 02:04:10,644
Ask her to burn
that wedding dress.

2311
02:04:10,669 --> 02:04:13,042
This damn wedding
is not going to happen!

2312
02:04:14,418 --> 02:04:15,425
Oh, no!

2313
02:04:15,613 --> 02:04:17,097
What's he saying?

2314
02:04:44,784 --> 02:04:45,792
Answer the call, John.

2315
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,605
It's Kurian.
I'll talk to him later.

2316
02:04:47,643 --> 02:04:49,050
Pick up and say something.

2317
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,706
<i>- John...</i>
- Kurian...

2318
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:54,167
I'll call you later, please.

2319
02:04:54,441 --> 02:04:56,066
I am at this shady place.
That's why.

2320
02:05:01,931 --> 02:05:02,931
What is this?

2321
02:05:11,659 --> 02:05:13,329
He's at a shady place, huh?

2322
02:05:14,167 --> 02:05:17,712
I'll show him
what being shady is like!

2323
02:05:19,237 --> 02:05:22,430
<i>Please call after some time.</i>

2324
02:05:22,690 --> 02:05:23,698
<i>Ichaya...</i>

2325
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:26,276
<i>Ichaya!</i>

2326
02:05:28,870 --> 02:05:29,878
<i>Ichaya,</i> please wait.

2327
02:05:34,275 --> 02:05:35,423
<i>Ichaya!</i>

2328
02:05:36,816 --> 02:05:38,570
At least tell me
where you're going!

2329
02:05:40,922 --> 02:05:41,922
Shucks!

2330
02:05:57,534 --> 02:05:59,300
- Hello?
- Eesho, where are you?

2331
02:05:59,325 --> 02:06:00,715
I've been calling you for so long!

2332
02:06:01,448 --> 02:06:03,198
I am at... err... this place.
What's the matter?

2333
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:04,433
I want to see you right away.

2334
02:06:05,816 --> 02:06:07,949
This is not a place
you can come to.

2335
02:06:08,650 --> 02:06:10,214
Eesho, stop fooling around.

2336
02:06:10,441 --> 02:06:11,893
I need to meet you urgently.

2337
02:06:11,918 --> 02:06:14,089
Didn't I tell you?
You cannot come to this place.

2338
02:06:15,191 --> 02:06:16,199
You...

2339
02:06:16,668 --> 02:06:17,675
Are you drunk?

2340
02:06:19,838 --> 02:06:20,846
What if I am?

2341
02:06:20,871 --> 02:06:24,464
Oh! So you got drunk, called my dad
and created this mess, huh?

2342
02:06:24,674 --> 02:06:26,807
<i>You know the shitstorm
you've caused now?</i>

2343
02:06:27,183 --> 02:06:29,441
I haven't called your dad.
Neither did I tell him anything.

2344
02:06:29,465 --> 02:06:32,291
But I intend to, and I need
to have a drink before that.

2345
02:06:32,316 --> 02:06:33,324
I'm yet to talk to him.

2346
02:06:33,349 --> 02:06:34,817
Tell me where you are, you dog!

2347
02:06:57,566 --> 02:06:58,846
Aren't you John's driver?

2348
02:06:58,871 --> 02:06:59,879
Yes, sir.

2349
02:07:00,050 --> 02:07:01,610
John sir has come
to the hospital.

2350
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,899
Why has he come to <i>this</i> hospital?

2351
02:07:09,847 --> 02:07:11,603
Where is John? John Kattadi?

2352
02:07:11,628 --> 02:07:13,532
Sir, he's in Samuel sir's cabin.

2353
02:07:20,930 --> 02:07:23,716
<i>Twenty-five dried gooseberries,
20 petals of garlic,</i>

2354
02:07:23,741 --> 02:07:25,279
<i>15 green bird's eye chillies,</i>

2355
02:07:25,387 --> 02:07:29,983
<i>rock salt, ginger extract, lemon
extract, bananas and black cumin.</i>

2356
02:07:30,008 --> 02:07:32,523
<i>Add them to neem oil
and grind it properly.</i>

2357
02:07:32,548 --> 02:07:34,454
<i>Have this concoction
twice a day for two days.</i>

2358
02:07:34,479 --> 02:07:35,532
Hey! Hey!

2359
02:07:36,246 --> 02:07:38,469
- Where's the toilet?
- The visitors' toilet is on the 7th.

2360
02:07:38,493 --> 02:07:40,392
- Where's the nearest one?
- The nearest one is nearby, sir.

2361
02:07:40,416 --> 02:07:41,431
Make way, please!

2362
02:07:41,456 --> 02:07:42,464
Oh, no!

2363
02:07:46,433 --> 02:07:47,456
Open, damn it!

2364
02:07:54,073 --> 02:07:56,120
Well, I said I was at this
shady place because...

2365
02:07:56,793 --> 02:07:57,800
Doctor, hey!

2366
02:07:58,027 --> 02:07:59,650
What I was saying earlier
was that.

2367
02:07:59,675 --> 02:08:01,878
Kurian needn't know about this
for the time being.

2368
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:04,385
That's why I spoke like that
when he called me earlier.

2369
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:07,362
But Eesho is going to marry
Kurian's daughter, right?

2370
02:08:07,613 --> 02:08:09,166
So, you will have to say it
at some point?

2371
02:08:09,190 --> 02:08:11,643
Well, if he learns about this
pregnancy in between all this,

2372
02:08:11,668 --> 02:08:13,143
everything will become complicated.

2373
02:08:13,503 --> 02:08:16,074
This is not your ordinary
pregnancy, right?

2374
02:08:18,832 --> 02:08:20,605
You needn't tell this
to anyone, Doctor.

2375
02:08:20,783 --> 02:08:22,204
I'm not going to tell anyone.

2376
02:08:24,268 --> 02:08:26,150
- Why should I tell anyone anyway?
- Exactly!

2377
02:08:32,252 --> 02:08:33,681
It's a little delicate now.

2378
02:08:33,956 --> 02:08:35,861
I'll tell him
once the wedding is over.

2379
02:08:36,293 --> 02:08:37,604
There won't be any problem then.

2380
02:08:38,082 --> 02:08:39,090
Okay.

2381
02:08:39,672 --> 02:08:40,683
As you wish.

2382
02:09:17,334 --> 02:09:19,469
- What do you want?
- Sir, I am Happy.

2383
02:09:19,494 --> 02:09:20,695
I'm not so happy.

2384
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:22,452
Shall I tell you something
that will make you very happy then?

2385
02:09:22,476 --> 02:09:24,225
Yeah! Try your luck!

2386
02:09:25,032 --> 02:09:27,079
Considering your stature
and status,

2387
02:09:27,242 --> 02:09:29,821
you must be giving an expensive
surprise gift to your son-in-law,

2388
02:09:29,837 --> 02:09:31,117
apart from the dowry, right?

2389
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:33,211
If you could inform us what that is,

2390
02:09:33,236 --> 02:09:35,813
<i>we'd like to plan a small event
that matches it.</i>

2391
02:09:35,984 --> 02:09:36,992
What's that gift, sir?

2392
02:09:37,194 --> 02:09:38,640
BMW? Benz?

2393
02:09:38,828 --> 02:09:40,413
If it's one of those luxury cars,

2394
02:09:40,438 --> 02:09:42,195
my aunt's son is a dealer
of such cars.

2395
02:09:42,312 --> 02:09:44,094
I can get a good commission...
Argh!

2396
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:45,960
I mean, I can get you
a good discount, sir.

2397
02:09:46,659 --> 02:09:48,869
Your bloody auntie's discount!

2398
02:09:48,894 --> 02:09:52,710
Not for him! I'm on my way
to give a gift to his father first!

2399
02:09:52,735 --> 02:09:54,766
<i>- Where?</i>
- I'll call you after and tell you...

2400
02:09:54,791 --> 02:09:56,362
<i>- Please do.</i>
- ...what my gift to the groom will be!

2401
02:09:56,386 --> 02:09:57,786
<i>- Okay, sir.</i>
- Hang up and get lost!

2402
02:09:59,459 --> 02:10:00,982
Is there such a ceremony?

2403
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:02,038
I didn't know that.

2404
02:10:02,196 --> 02:10:03,882
Hey! Don't waste time.
Note this down!

2405
02:10:03,907 --> 02:10:04,927
There's a ceremony
where the bride's father

2406
02:10:04,935 --> 02:10:05,991
gives a gift to the groom's father.

2407
02:10:06,015 --> 02:10:07,023
Okay. I know that.

2408
02:10:07,919 --> 02:10:09,866
Such unique ceremonies.
Very interesting.

2409
02:10:12,618 --> 02:10:13,652
<i>Ichaya!</i>

2410
02:10:16,138 --> 02:10:17,209
Gosh!

2411
02:10:17,234 --> 02:10:18,648
Why does this guy
keep following me?

2412
02:10:18,991 --> 02:10:20,037
Pull over.

2413
02:10:30,874 --> 02:10:32,553
The co-passenger is not wearing
a seat belt.

2414
02:10:32,577 --> 02:10:33,702
You'll have to pay a fine.

2415
02:10:33,727 --> 02:10:35,787
Sir, I was wearing the seat belt.
I swear!

2416
02:10:35,852 --> 02:10:37,709
I just took it off
when I saw you.

2417
02:10:37,915 --> 02:10:39,920
Sir, we don't have time.
It's the end of the month.

2418
02:10:39,953 --> 02:10:41,235
Come out with your documents.

2419
02:10:42,265 --> 02:10:43,273
Shucks!

2420
02:10:43,298 --> 02:10:44,305
Seat belt, damn it!

2421
02:10:46,906 --> 02:10:48,077
There's no cash in this?

2422
02:10:48,594 --> 02:10:49,679
Do you have any cash with you?

2423
02:10:49,703 --> 02:10:50,710
How will I have cash?

2424
02:10:50,766 --> 02:10:51,774
How about you?

2425
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:53,548
No.

2426
02:10:53,641 --> 02:10:54,913
Such misers!

2427
02:10:58,016 --> 02:10:59,024
Sir!

2428
02:10:59,376 --> 02:11:00,384
Sir!

2429
02:11:00,708 --> 02:11:02,351
Sir, I don't have cash.
Do you accept cards?

2430
02:11:02,375 --> 02:11:03,694
You own a Benz, sir.

2431
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:04,944
Stop playing tricks,

2432
02:11:04,969 --> 02:11:07,141
pay a fine of Rs. 500
and get going.

2433
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:08,719
So, you don't accept cards?

2434
02:11:08,774 --> 02:11:09,782
Huh?

2435
02:11:09,993 --> 02:11:11,516
Okay. Fine.

2436
02:11:12,070 --> 02:11:13,078
Such waste of time.

2437
02:11:16,155 --> 02:11:17,163
Ah!

2438
02:11:17,188 --> 02:11:18,313
I'll solve this right away!

2439
02:11:18,969 --> 02:11:20,172
Go, show the documents!

2440
02:11:20,501 --> 02:11:23,085
Sir, this is the father
of my son's fiancée.

2441
02:11:23,110 --> 02:11:24,203
Oh! Oh!

2442
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:25,384
Kurian!

2443
02:11:25,532 --> 02:11:26,540
Oh!

2444
02:11:29,024 --> 02:11:30,170
Give me Rs. 500.

2445
02:11:30,344 --> 02:11:31,764
I was just thinking about you.

2446
02:11:32,196 --> 02:11:33,709
You can deduct this
from the dowry.

2447
02:11:33,734 --> 02:11:35,092
Let me go stuff this
in his mouth!

2448
02:11:40,657 --> 02:11:41,665
Here's the fine, sir.

2449
02:11:42,321 --> 02:11:44,852
Giving or accepting
dowry is a crime.

2450
02:11:45,149 --> 02:11:46,558
I can charge a case for that.

2451
02:11:46,583 --> 02:11:47,667
Sheesh!

2452
02:11:47,691 --> 02:11:49,438
I was just joking!

2453
02:11:49,463 --> 02:11:50,961
Okay! Let it be!

2454
02:11:50,986 --> 02:11:52,375
What is this, sir?

2455
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,408
Kurian!

2456
02:11:56,563 --> 02:11:57,571
John.

2457
02:12:02,148 --> 02:12:03,844
Well, how come you're here?

2458
02:12:04,656 --> 02:12:05,757
I have to...

2459
02:12:06,243 --> 02:12:07,581
ask you something.

2460
02:12:08,321 --> 02:12:09,855
What is it, Kurian?
What happened?

2461
02:12:10,188 --> 02:12:11,558
Who was that Bengali

2462
02:12:11,852 --> 02:12:14,245
staying with Eesho?

2463
02:12:20,093 --> 02:12:22,089
- Kurian..
- Didn't you tell me that day

2464
02:12:22,469 --> 02:12:24,956
that it was a guy with
a long beard and thick glasses.

2465
02:12:25,687 --> 02:12:26,854
Have you seen him?

2466
02:12:27,523 --> 02:12:28,898
I... I was..

2467
02:12:28,923 --> 02:12:29,931
Hey!

2468
02:12:30,071 --> 02:12:32,743
Are you aware that there was a girl
staying with Eesho?

2469
02:12:34,789 --> 02:12:36,484
Kurian,
I was going to tell you that.

2470
02:12:36,509 --> 02:12:38,376
You needn't do a damn thing!

2471
02:12:40,876 --> 02:12:43,555
Did you know that she got pregnant?

2472
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:45,773
Let me explain.

2473
02:12:45,798 --> 02:12:48,001
Your son gets a girl pregnant,

2474
02:12:48,227 --> 02:12:50,563
you sweep it under the carpet,

2475
02:12:50,626 --> 02:12:54,773
and you hope to marry him off
to my daughter?

2476
02:12:54,853 --> 02:12:57,844
- It's not like what you think.
- I don't need to hear a thing!

2477
02:13:01,436 --> 02:13:02,789
This is it!

2478
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:04,738
I shouldn't see you

2479
02:13:04,774 --> 02:13:08,636
anywhere close to my daughter
or my house ever!

2480
02:13:09,406 --> 02:13:12,479
There's nothing between us anymore.

2481
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:30,303
And the balance
of that Rs. 2,000!

2482
02:13:30,328 --> 02:13:31,932
Keep it as alms...

2483
02:13:31,968 --> 02:13:33,416
for quitting this alliance!

2484
02:13:42,906 --> 02:13:44,688
Here's the receipt
and the balance money.

2485
02:13:45,101 --> 02:13:47,328
So, we'll come and meet you
at your house at our convenience.

2486
02:13:47,352 --> 02:13:48,538
Why?

2487
02:13:48,563 --> 02:13:50,617
Well, from whatever I heard,

2488
02:13:50,946 --> 02:13:54,866
there's dowry, adultery, pregnancy,
molestation and cheating.

2489
02:13:54,891 --> 02:13:56,589
So, there will be
quite a number of cases!

2490
02:13:57,134 --> 02:13:58,225
I have your address.

2491
02:13:58,375 --> 02:13:59,968
I'll come and meet you
at your house.

2492
02:14:04,063 --> 02:14:05,071
<i>Ichaya...</i>

2493
02:14:05,134 --> 02:14:06,740
If we don't do something
immediately,

2494
02:14:06,765 --> 02:14:08,265
the situation will get
out of hand.

2495
02:14:09,228 --> 02:14:10,235
Call Eesho.

2496
02:14:19,823 --> 02:14:20,831
<i>Ichaya!</i>

2497
02:14:21,511 --> 02:14:23,087
I've been calling you for so long!

2498
02:14:23,112 --> 02:14:24,120
Where is Anna?

2499
02:14:24,159 --> 02:14:25,549
Anna has gone to meet Eesho.

2500
02:14:25,612 --> 02:14:26,877
To meet Eesho?

2501
02:14:26,902 --> 02:14:28,003
Where?

2502
02:14:28,174 --> 02:14:29,322
I didn't ask her that.

2503
02:14:30,198 --> 02:14:31,339
Call her right away!

2504
02:14:32,042 --> 02:14:34,102
- <i>Ichaya,</i> what's the matter?
- Call her, I say!

2505
02:14:34,127 --> 02:14:35,393
Tell me what the matter is!

2506
02:14:35,448 --> 02:14:37,002
Haven't I told you earlier itself

2507
02:14:37,027 --> 02:14:38,900
that only his name is <i>Eesho</i>.

2508
02:14:38,925 --> 02:14:40,572
His character is that of Judas!

2509
02:14:40,597 --> 02:14:43,267
He got a girl who was staying
with him pregnant,

2510
02:14:43,292 --> 02:14:45,259
and he wants to marry
our daughter!

2511
02:14:49,174 --> 02:14:50,494
Just call her!

2512
02:14:51,339 --> 02:14:52,347
Give it to me!

2513
02:15:01,565 --> 02:15:02,916
- Yes, Mummy.
- This is your dad.

2514
02:15:03,214 --> 02:15:05,362
- Where are you?
- I came to meet Eesho.

2515
02:15:05,566 --> 02:15:06,573
Where?

2516
02:15:06,605 --> 02:15:07,847
At Hotel Sheraton.

2517
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:08,987
Huh?

2518
02:15:09,049 --> 02:15:10,057
At a hotel?

2519
02:15:10,674 --> 02:15:11,681
Where is he?

2520
02:15:11,706 --> 02:15:13,432
He's upstairs.
I'm going there now.

2521
02:15:13,472 --> 02:15:14,533
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

2522
02:15:14,558 --> 02:15:15,846
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

2523
02:15:15,956 --> 02:15:17,089
I'll be there right away.

2524
02:15:17,222 --> 02:15:18,230
Dad?

2525
02:15:18,291 --> 02:15:19,299
Hello?

2526
02:15:25,028 --> 02:15:26,901
- Why are you coming?
- I'm coming too!

2527
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:28,683
He has called her to a hotel.

2528
02:15:29,025 --> 02:15:31,212
There are only a few days
left for the wedding.

2529
02:15:31,253 --> 02:15:33,986
And he has called my daughter
to a hotel!

2530
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:36,979
My dear Anna,

2531
02:15:37,042 --> 02:15:39,440
believe me only if you can.

2532
02:15:39,597 --> 02:15:42,142
If I've said that
I haven't called him, I haven't!

2533
02:15:42,167 --> 02:15:44,393
I haven't said anything
to your dad either.

2534
02:15:44,761 --> 02:15:46,542
Why is my dad so angry then?

2535
02:15:46,643 --> 02:15:48,159
Well, that is...

2536
02:15:58,456 --> 02:15:59,800
Where's the rooftop bar?

2537
02:15:59,862 --> 02:16:00,869
It's at the rooftop, sir.

2538
02:16:01,722 --> 02:16:03,472
- Huh?
- At the rooftop.

2539
02:16:03,497 --> 02:16:04,505
Oh!

2540
02:16:05,761 --> 02:16:06,769
<i>Ichaya!</i>

2541
02:16:06,886 --> 02:16:08,909
Why are you driving so fast?

2542
02:16:09,011 --> 02:16:11,253
Didn't you understand
what I told you so far?

2543
02:16:11,737 --> 02:16:14,526
He shouldn't meet her,
come what may!

2544
02:16:14,777 --> 02:16:16,026
If he sees her,

2545
02:16:16,105 --> 02:16:17,589
he will brainwash her.

2546
02:16:23,058 --> 02:16:25,573
I thought he called my dad
and spoke about the job.

2547
02:16:26,315 --> 02:16:30,393
Didn't I tell you all this while
that I am innocent? I am innocent!

2548
02:16:30,418 --> 02:16:31,621
Innocent?

2549
02:16:31,822 --> 02:16:33,354
He is innocent, it seems.

2550
02:16:33,494 --> 02:16:35,987
- John, how about another drink?
- You!

2551
02:16:36,956 --> 02:16:38,276
His speech is mumbling already.

2552
02:16:38,406 --> 02:16:39,877
And he wants another drink!

2553
02:16:39,902 --> 02:16:41,215
Uncle, that's another problem.

2554
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:43,018
Dad said he is coming here.

2555
02:16:43,659 --> 02:16:46,099
If he sees Eesho like this,
it will be an even bigger problem!

2556
02:16:48,049 --> 02:16:49,057
That's right.

2557
02:16:49,402 --> 02:16:50,464
Let's leave quickly.

2558
02:16:50,659 --> 02:16:53,595
I'll meet Kurian
and try to convince him somehow.

2559
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:55,237
- Okay, bye!
- Come on!

2560
02:16:55,611 --> 02:16:56,619
Get up!

2561
02:16:57,917 --> 02:16:59,245
What's that for?
Keep it there.

2562
02:16:59,698 --> 02:17:00,706
Please!

2563
02:17:03,987 --> 02:17:04,987
Come!

2564
02:17:17,922 --> 02:17:19,500
Oh, no! Monster!

2565
02:17:19,525 --> 02:17:20,650
Stop there, you!

2566
02:17:21,165 --> 02:17:22,345
Stand here.

2567
02:17:39,627 --> 02:17:41,315
Kurian... let's talk.

2568
02:17:41,355 --> 02:17:44,097
Didn't I tell you that you don't
have to say a damn thing?

2569
02:17:46,659 --> 02:17:47,667
Anna...

2570
02:17:48,565 --> 02:17:49,675
come here.

2571
02:17:50,205 --> 02:17:51,541
Dad, I was...

2572
02:17:51,573 --> 02:17:52,659
Just come here, I said!

2573
02:18:01,298 --> 02:18:02,345
Dad!

2574
02:18:02,370 --> 02:18:03,735
You don't have to say anything.

2575
02:18:04,463 --> 02:18:06,336
I'll tell you everything.

2576
02:18:06,807 --> 02:18:09,875
They were cheating you,
all of them!

2577
02:18:09,972 --> 02:18:12,618
Kurian, you're not aware
of the whole picture.

2578
02:18:12,643 --> 02:18:13,736
Oh!

2579
02:18:13,924 --> 02:18:15,321
I'm not aware, huh?

2580
02:18:18,987 --> 02:18:20,291
I will ask him.

2581
02:18:21,471 --> 02:18:22,830
This is for you to hear too.

2582
02:18:26,050 --> 02:18:28,580
Was there a girl staying
with you in Bangalore?

2583
02:18:30,002 --> 02:18:31,026
There was.

2584
02:18:31,956 --> 02:18:33,416
Did she get pregnant?

2585
02:18:35,917 --> 02:18:36,925
It was an accident.

2586
02:18:39,259 --> 02:18:41,116
Was your dad aware of this?

2587
02:18:44,221 --> 02:18:45,229
I had to tell him.

2588
02:18:49,321 --> 02:18:50,329
You heard him, right?

2589
02:18:51,932 --> 02:18:52,939
You heard him too?

2590
02:18:54,335 --> 02:18:56,132
No further doubts, I presume?

2591
02:18:56,666 --> 02:18:58,632
- Kurian..
- Don't utter a word.

2592
02:19:07,486 --> 02:19:08,494
Come.

2593
02:19:08,658 --> 02:19:11,969
Uncle, all this ruckus
for such a silly thing?

2594
02:19:17,953 --> 02:19:20,190
- You bloody rascal!
<i>- Ichaya!</i>

2595
02:19:20,215 --> 02:19:21,737
- Oh, no!
- Kurian!

2596
02:19:21,825 --> 02:19:23,472
I won't spare him!

2597
02:19:24,081 --> 02:19:26,175
This must be silly for you!

2598
02:19:27,417 --> 02:19:29,445
But for me,
it's my daughter's life!

2599
02:19:29,963 --> 02:19:31,736
Dad, whatever you're saying
is true.

2600
02:19:31,862 --> 02:19:33,859
But these are all things
I'm aware of too!

2601
02:19:39,268 --> 02:19:40,750
What are you saying?

2602
02:19:41,627 --> 02:19:42,634
Yes, Dad.

2603
02:19:43,751 --> 02:19:45,786
But there's something
that you don't know.

2604
02:19:50,681 --> 02:19:52,595
I am the girl
who was staying with him.

2605
02:20:00,691 --> 02:20:02,743
I am three months pregnant now, Dad.

2606
02:20:18,768 --> 02:20:19,776
She is just...

2607
02:20:20,027 --> 02:20:21,034
making this up, right?

2608
02:20:22,432 --> 02:20:23,440
<i>Ichaya...</i>

2609
02:20:23,635 --> 02:20:25,753
I was going through so much
turmoil for so many days,

2610
02:20:25,769 --> 02:20:27,328
not knowing how to say this to you.

2611
02:20:30,869 --> 02:20:33,221
I wanted to tell this
to you somehow.

2612
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:37,278
But I didn't know
how you would react to it.

2613
02:20:56,045 --> 02:20:57,052
Oh!

2614
02:20:57,491 --> 02:20:58,499
So, that's how it is!

2615
02:20:59,873 --> 02:21:02,026
Everyone knew everything.

2616
02:21:03,037 --> 02:21:05,269
I'm not needed here anymore.

2617
02:21:08,726 --> 02:21:11,007
All of you can do
whatever you want.

2618
02:21:17,170 --> 02:21:18,420
I am just a fool.

2619
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:26,170
I was playing the fool.

2620
02:21:32,866 --> 02:21:33,874
You...

2621
02:21:34,366 --> 02:21:36,585
Weren't you my best friend?

2622
02:22:00,625 --> 02:22:04,120
- Sir, how about a brass band?
- Right now?

2623
02:22:04,176 --> 02:22:06,426
Sir, it's a new team.
I got them from Chennai.

2624
02:22:06,584 --> 02:22:08,673
This is their first programme.
It will also be their last.

2625
02:22:08,697 --> 02:22:10,263
I mean, it will be their best!

2626
02:22:10,288 --> 02:22:12,401
I know that you won't understand
whatever I say.

2627
02:22:12,558 --> 02:22:13,604
So I'll make you listen to them.

2628
02:22:13,628 --> 02:22:14,628
Start!

2629
02:22:32,494 --> 02:22:33,595
Stop!

2630
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:36,827
How's it, sir?
Isn't it awesome?

2631
02:22:38,311 --> 02:22:39,553
- Nice.
<i>- Thank you!</i>

2632
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:44,207
Oh, no! Blood!

2633
02:22:45,075 --> 02:22:46,464
Eesho! Oh, no!

2634
02:22:46,489 --> 02:22:47,536
Eesho!

2635
02:22:47,561 --> 02:22:48,569
Son!

2636
02:22:49,184 --> 02:22:50,192
Eesho!

2637
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:51,738
Of course.

2638
02:23:29,058 --> 02:23:30,066
Sorry, Dad.

2639
02:23:37,339 --> 02:23:39,042
I just couldn't bring myself
to tell you.

2640
02:23:50,395 --> 02:23:52,630
Had you told this to me first,

2641
02:23:53,114 --> 02:23:56,465
what did you think
your father would do?

2642
02:24:27,350 --> 02:24:28,358
Hello?

2643
02:24:28,733 --> 02:24:30,318
Auntie, can you pass
the phone to Eesho?

2644
02:24:31,333 --> 02:24:32,341
This is Eesho.

2645
02:24:32,973 --> 02:24:34,020
Tell me.

2646
02:24:34,928 --> 02:24:35,936
Eesho,

2647
02:24:37,147 --> 02:24:39,239
I don't know what should be done
and how.

2648
02:24:40,669 --> 02:24:42,629
But if we are getting married,

2649
02:24:43,669 --> 02:24:44,841
wherever it may be,

2650
02:24:45,098 --> 02:24:47,731
my dad should bring me
to that church, holding my hands.

2651
02:24:49,263 --> 02:24:50,419
Happily.

2652
02:24:54,669 --> 02:24:56,232
If not, I don't want this marriage.

2653
02:25:00,317 --> 02:25:01,325
Anna?

2654
02:25:17,825 --> 02:25:18,974
Didn't you go to sleep yet?

2655
02:25:46,544 --> 02:25:47,989
When we were in college,

2656
02:25:49,647 --> 02:25:52,293
everyone knew that
Kurian was in love with your mom,

2657
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:53,454
except your mom.

2658
02:25:55,529 --> 02:25:56,849
And finally, when the time came,

2659
02:25:57,177 --> 02:25:59,099
Kurian didn't express
his love to Annamma.

2660
02:25:59,124 --> 02:26:00,728
He expressed it
to Anakkallil Pappachan.

2661
02:26:01,083 --> 02:26:02,375
Your grandfather.

2662
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:08,407
"You're not even worthy of cattle feed
from Anakkallil house."

2663
02:26:08,785 --> 02:26:11,515
That was what Pappachan
told Kurian's father then.

2664
02:26:12,983 --> 02:26:15,723
If we take that into account, when
we went there with this proposal,

2665
02:26:16,256 --> 02:26:18,623
Kurian shouldn't even have
allowed us into his premises.

2666
02:26:20,998 --> 02:26:22,922
I can understand all that, Dad.

2667
02:26:22,946 --> 02:26:23,946
- But..
- No!

2668
02:26:24,537 --> 02:26:25,990
You won't understand.

2669
02:26:28,162 --> 02:26:29,622
I remember a young Kurian

2670
02:26:29,647 --> 02:26:31,336
who came running to our bank

2671
02:26:31,380 --> 02:26:34,469
with Elsy's nuptial chain
when Anna was born.

2672
02:26:36,271 --> 02:26:38,094
That day, he didn't even agree
to take the money

2673
02:26:38,118 --> 02:26:40,180
without mortgaging
that chain there.

2674
02:26:43,342 --> 02:26:45,209
When you have children,

2675
02:26:45,677 --> 02:26:47,458
it's like starting your life
all over again.

2676
02:26:49,114 --> 02:26:52,169
All the habits and priorities
you had until then will change.

2677
02:26:54,693 --> 02:26:56,083
When a child is born,

2678
02:26:56,903 --> 02:26:59,404
a father and mother
are also born along with it.

2679
02:27:03,537 --> 02:27:06,388
Do you know how long
he would have dreamt of.

2680
02:27:06,629 --> 02:27:08,003
Anna's wedding day?

2681
02:27:10,389 --> 02:27:11,748
That wedding

2682
02:27:12,053 --> 02:27:13,731
and his daughter's life...

2683
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:16,412
If today, he felt like he has
no role in either of them,

2684
02:27:17,201 --> 02:27:18,770
then we are at fault.

2685
02:27:19,475 --> 02:27:20,483
You are at fault.

2686
02:27:23,576 --> 02:27:27,292
You won't understand
the gravity of his pain now.

2687
02:27:29,324 --> 02:27:30,825
You will begin to understand it...

2688
02:27:32,584 --> 02:27:34,230
after seven or eight months.

2689
02:27:42,342 --> 02:27:43,350
Dad!

2690
02:27:49,897 --> 02:27:51,581
Is there any way out, Dad?

2691
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:55,847
There is one.

2692
02:27:57,155 --> 02:27:58,373
I can show it to you,

2693
02:27:58,873 --> 02:28:00,740
but you will have to walk
that path alone.

2694
02:28:04,256 --> 02:28:05,363
Good morning, sir.

2695
02:28:08,131 --> 02:28:10,192
Sir, Dr. Samuel had called.

2696
02:28:10,225 --> 02:28:12,168
- Why?
- He said it's really late.

2697
02:28:12,193 --> 02:28:14,240
He was asking if we can make the
presentation, at least by tomorrow.

2698
02:28:14,264 --> 02:28:16,692
Call him and tell him
that we're not pitching this time.

2699
02:28:16,717 --> 02:28:18,170
But, sir, didn't we commit to it?

2700
02:28:18,405 --> 02:28:19,412
Hey!

2701
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:21,966
I will throw this business
to the dogs!

2702
02:28:23,139 --> 02:28:24,426
To the dogs?

2703
02:28:24,748 --> 02:28:25,756
Sir!

2704
02:28:29,929 --> 02:28:33,003
I was going to tell you
that you have a visitor.

2705
02:28:33,028 --> 02:28:34,217
Just forgot...

2706
02:28:34,608 --> 02:28:35,616
Uncle,

2707
02:28:35,944 --> 02:28:38,208
I want to talk to you
regarding something serious.

2708
02:28:38,233 --> 02:28:40,949
I have nothing more to say
than what I did yesterday.

2709
02:28:41,014 --> 02:28:42,832
Nothing.
You may go, Eesho.

2710
02:28:43,318 --> 02:28:44,503
I am busy.

2711
02:28:44,827 --> 02:28:46,270
Didn't I tell you

2712
02:28:46,295 --> 02:28:47,927
not to allow visitors today?

2713
02:28:47,952 --> 02:28:49,139
When did you say that?

2714
02:28:51,334 --> 02:28:52,801
However busy you may be,

2715
02:28:53,348 --> 02:28:54,762
you should listen to this, Uncle.

2716
02:28:57,044 --> 02:28:59,518
During pregnancy,

2717
02:28:59,927 --> 02:29:02,536
the stress and anxiety
that the mother goes through

2718
02:29:03,233 --> 02:29:05,383
may cause physical
or mental disabilities

2719
02:29:05,407 --> 02:29:07,359
to the child that's yet to be born.

2720
02:29:07,623 --> 02:29:09,287
Many research reports
are coming out,

2721
02:29:09,326 --> 02:29:11,724
all over the world, about this.

2722
02:29:12,748 --> 02:29:13,756
What?

2723
02:29:14,653 --> 02:29:16,083
For example...

2724
02:29:26,397 --> 02:29:28,094
This is the most recent
research report

2725
02:29:28,219 --> 02:29:30,285
from World Health Organization.

2726
02:29:30,623 --> 02:29:34,407
The depression and anxiety
of a pregnant mother

2727
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,356
can increase stress hormones,

2728
02:29:36,381 --> 02:29:39,289
and that can severely affect
the child in her womb,

2729
02:29:39,305 --> 02:29:42,117
according to these research reports.

2730
02:29:45,897 --> 02:29:46,905
So?

2731
02:29:47,888 --> 02:29:48,896
Well...

2732
02:29:48,921 --> 02:29:51,459
We can't blame anyone, right, Uncle?

2733
02:29:52,802 --> 02:29:58,114
Depression and stress have become
as common as a cold or a cough now.

2734
02:29:58,867 --> 02:30:01,590
Sometimes it may be
due to our lifestyle issues,

2735
02:30:01,889 --> 02:30:03,888
or due to the stress
at our workplaces.

2736
02:30:04,194 --> 02:30:05,272
If not any of those,

2737
02:30:05,387 --> 02:30:07,965
the minor arguments and fights
that occur in families,

2738
02:30:07,989 --> 02:30:09,029
stubbornness

2739
02:30:09,428 --> 02:30:11,194
or any such minor incident

2740
02:30:11,256 --> 02:30:13,373
can propel a person into depression.

2741
02:30:14,061 --> 02:30:15,069
But...

2742
02:30:15,396 --> 02:30:16,404
that?

2743
02:30:16,795 --> 02:30:17,803
Yes, Uncle.

2744
02:30:18,311 --> 02:30:20,864
When certain people are angry
or under extreme stress,

2745
02:30:21,599 --> 02:30:23,646
they might resort to violence.

2746
02:30:25,615 --> 02:30:26,836
But certain others

2747
02:30:27,521 --> 02:30:29,423
don't express any of this
to the outside world

2748
02:30:29,545 --> 02:30:31,204
and keep it all
within their minds.

2749
02:30:33,577 --> 02:30:34,751
But, Uncle, that...

2750
02:30:35,295 --> 02:30:38,376
That may lead to much more severe
health issues.

2751
02:30:38,975 --> 02:30:40,602
And what if they are pregnant?

2752
02:30:41,428 --> 02:30:43,976
Even the lives of the mother
and the child may be endangered

2753
02:30:44,001 --> 02:30:45,361
at the same time.

2754
02:30:46,568 --> 02:30:47,576
Eesho...

2755
02:30:48,134 --> 02:30:49,935
I didn't do it deliberately...

2756
02:30:52,157 --> 02:30:54,688
This is a research report
by the Central Child Welfare Board.

2757
02:30:57,436 --> 02:30:59,818
If the mental and physical health

2758
02:30:59,843 --> 02:31:01,928
of every unborn baby
has to be better,

2759
02:31:02,146 --> 02:31:03,617
the atmosphere around them...

2760
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:05,645
I mean, the family atmosphere,

2761
02:31:05,748 --> 02:31:07,029
the social atmosphere...

2762
02:31:07,388 --> 02:31:09,943
There should be attempts
to improve all these as well, Uncle.

2763
02:31:10,583 --> 02:31:11,591
Well...

2764
02:31:12,037 --> 02:31:13,092
what do I...

2765
02:31:13,117 --> 02:31:14,177
Not just you, Uncle.

2766
02:31:14,553 --> 02:31:15,686
Each one of us.

2767
02:31:18,616 --> 02:31:19,623
Especially,

2768
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:22,921
a hospital group
which specialises in maternity.

2769
02:31:23,576 --> 02:31:24,583
Huh?

2770
02:31:27,107 --> 02:31:28,115
Yes, Uncle.

2771
02:31:28,725 --> 02:31:30,584
When a child is born into a family,

2772
02:31:30,881 --> 02:31:33,029
it's not just a new baby
who's born there.

2773
02:31:33,592 --> 02:31:35,764
A new father and mother
are also born the same day.

2774
02:31:43,332 --> 02:31:45,605
SMT Group of Maternity Hospitals.

2775
02:31:46,060 --> 02:31:47,862
Not just for newborn babies,

2776
02:31:48,153 --> 02:31:49,917
but for newborn parents too.

2777
02:31:56,599 --> 02:31:58,200
This is awesome!
This will be amazing!

2778
02:32:22,341 --> 02:32:24,490
<i>SMT Group of Maternity Hospitals.</i>

2779
02:32:24,585 --> 02:32:26,341
<i>Not just for newborn babies,</i>

2780
02:32:26,366 --> 02:32:28,132
<i>but for newborn parents too.</i>

2781
02:32:28,373 --> 02:32:30,880
<i>Kochi, Calicut, Chennai,
Hyderabad, Pune.</i>

2782
02:32:35,192 --> 02:32:37,106
That's it. That's the...

2783
02:32:37,169 --> 02:32:38,520
end of our presentation.

2784
02:33:08,733 --> 02:33:09,733
Two, three!

2785
02:33:18,685 --> 02:33:19,685
Oh, no! Rain?

2786
02:33:20,378 --> 02:33:22,902
Stop smiling!
Not here! Sprinkle it there!

2787
02:33:23,029 --> 02:33:24,739
- Sprinkle it over there!
- Yes!

2788
02:33:29,427 --> 02:33:30,528
Who's at that table?

2789
02:33:30,553 --> 02:33:32,927
Hey! That table looks really empty.
Fill up the place.

2790
02:33:33,301 --> 02:33:35,200
Don't forget to give our cards
to people who leave after dinner.

2791
02:33:35,224 --> 02:33:36,558
- All the best.
- Thank you.

2792
02:33:36,668 --> 02:33:37,793
- All the best.
- Thank you.

2793
02:33:37,988 --> 02:33:38,996
Hello?

2794
02:33:39,676 --> 02:33:41,113
Everyone, please pay attention.

2795
02:33:43,379 --> 02:33:46,332
Thank you for coming today.

2796
02:33:46,504 --> 02:33:47,512
Thank you!

2797
02:33:47,924 --> 02:33:50,513
Today is a very happy day for me!

2798
02:33:50,538 --> 02:33:52,300
- For us too, right?
- But...

2799
02:33:52,426 --> 02:33:55,223
I'm not just
a very happy father today.

2800
02:33:58,090 --> 02:34:01,965
I'm a very, very happy
future grandfather as well.

2801
02:34:05,271 --> 02:34:07,020
Well, I have no qualms
in saying this!

2802
02:34:08,949 --> 02:34:10,191
My daughter, Anna...

2803
02:34:11,043 --> 02:34:12,472
is three months pregnant.

2804
02:34:21,660 --> 02:34:22,754
How?

2805
02:34:23,715 --> 02:34:24,759
Three months?

2806
02:34:24,808 --> 02:34:27,207
In that case, I want to say
something too.

2807
02:34:27,253 --> 02:34:28,675
Okay. Tell me. Oops, sorry.

2808
02:34:28,778 --> 02:34:29,786
I know, buddy!

2809
02:34:29,942 --> 02:34:31,815
You want to say that the child's
father is your son, right?

2810
02:34:31,839 --> 02:34:33,442
It's not like
they haven't got that by now.

2811
02:34:33,466 --> 02:34:34,862
No! It's not that.

2812
02:34:34,887 --> 02:34:36,822
- I'll come there.
- Oh, no, <i>ichaya</i>!

2813
02:34:39,216 --> 02:34:41,145
Don't serve the ice cream, as yet.

2814
02:34:42,135 --> 02:34:43,346
Give it to me.

2815
02:34:43,464 --> 02:34:44,472
Hey!

2816
02:34:45,254 --> 02:34:48,744
Since Kurian has revealed
a surprise,

2817
02:34:49,089 --> 02:34:51,189
I guess it's my turn now.

2818
02:34:51,949 --> 02:34:55,517
I'm not just someone
who's going to be a grandfather today.

2819
02:34:55,707 --> 02:34:57,854
I am someone
who's going to be a father

2820
02:34:57,879 --> 02:34:59,079
all over again.

2821
02:35:04,065 --> 02:35:05,549
How is this possible for them?

2822
02:35:06,051 --> 02:35:07,855
Even my wife, Anna...

2823
02:35:08,241 --> 02:35:11,797
is three months pregnant,
just like her.

2824
02:35:14,691 --> 02:35:15,760
Wow!

2825
02:35:15,903 --> 02:35:17,646
Bro, when did this happen?

2826
02:35:18,176 --> 02:35:19,785
Somehow managed it in between
my busy schedule. Sorry!

2827
02:35:19,809 --> 02:35:21,009
That's awesome!

2828
02:35:22,854 --> 02:35:23,994
Dude!

2829
02:35:24,019 --> 02:35:26,378
Two baby showers!
Note it down!

2830
02:35:26,785 --> 02:35:27,894
Congratulations!

2831
02:35:30,817 --> 02:35:33,215
Okay. Serve the ice cream!
Come on!

2832
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:34,271
Oh, no!

2833
02:36:29,129 --> 02:36:30,510
Who is Anna's husband?

2834
02:36:30,763 --> 02:36:31,792
Me!

2835
02:36:32,003 --> 02:36:33,011
Huh?

2836
02:36:56,601 --> 02:36:57,601
Cut!
