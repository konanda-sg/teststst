1
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:45,627
What is this sir?

2
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,694
You guaranteed that
you'd teach me in a week!

3
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:49,439
My promotion's going
to be announced today.

4
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,769
Which means life will
be moving forward...

5
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,275
But look at my reverse! It sucks!

6
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,573
Relax, you'll be fine...

7
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:55,904
See this watch?

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,447
A student gifted
it to me yesterday...

9
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,415
foreign... not the watch,
my student.

10
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,210
A teacher's reward...
don't you forget.

11
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,819
C'mon try again...

12
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,489
Man...l'm getting an automatic!

13
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:14,758
Why are you wasting my time
teaching me on manual gears?

14
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:16,322
If you learn on
the manual stick shift,

15
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,198
you'll be able to drive
any car in the world.

16
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,403
Who knows,
today you're driving an automatic,

17
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:21,730
tomorrow you may not
even own a cycle!

18
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,602
Sir must you think such evil
thoughts aloud early in the morning?

19
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,300
My promotion is up today...
Say something positive.

20
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,745
Well if the teacher's
reward is in my fate,

21
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:30,471
you will surely get your promotion.

22
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,606
Sir if you keep sharing
these wise thoughts..

23
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:32,512
..instead of teaching me
how to drive,

24
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,675
I'm never going
to reach the office...

25
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:35,343
then no promotion, no car.
- Got a girlfriend?

26
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,512
How does it matter?
- What did you say her name was?

27
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,849
Mayera ...

28
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,688
Put it in self...

29
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:46,558
Now focus on her,
see her face before your eyes...

30
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,758
take her name lovingly
and leave the clutch...

31
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,126
Mayera...

32
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:53,837
Ya baby Mayera
- See the girlfriend's magic!?

33
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:05,308
Hey jigida jigida
Hey jigida jigida

00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:09,510

My friends wi;; be so,

43
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:51,990
Even my God makes a;;
my wishes come true.

44
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:53,291
Hey jigida jigida

45
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,661

So eat in your cubicle.

Mornings rise when ; gesture.

59
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,848
The moon revo;ves

60
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:48,749
around my roof-top.
- We';; get a good bargain sir.

61
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,548
Start with your price,
then come to ours...

62
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,020
That's how we build relationships.

63
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:53,920
Our horizontals, your verticals...

64
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:55,458
Can only integrate them
both with forward planning..

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,891

00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:06,462
Even destiny is designed
to fit my form.

69
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,596

Hey what about you?

108
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:39,860
What a shame
it took them this long..

109
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,023
...now if they'd done
this a year ago..

110
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,862
I'd have easily doubled
productivity by now...

111
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:46,936

147
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:33,707

Papa is looking for proposals...

149
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:37,739

00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,243
Ok, I will say yes
to the richest guy.

153
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:46,255
Done?

154
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:47,684
Excuse me.

Wow!!

158
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,274
Ok Mayera Sehgal,

159
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:13,145
if I was promoted a year ago,

160
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,684
I would have proposed then

161
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,185
and saved you from
Papa Osama's bombardment

162
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:20,519
Anyway, now that
I'm a Senior Executive,

163
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:21,853
So...

164
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:26,726
Will you marry me?

165
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,096
Yes...

166
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:40,269

00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:42,038

169
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,348
If you call my dad Osama once more,

170
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,043
I swear I'll mix RDX in your coffee!

171
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,415
Tell him about my car... my car...
- Ok.

172
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,387
Hey, tell him that...
- Shush... ringing...

173
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,297
Hi papa
- Why didn't you call at lunch time?

174
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:04,594
I was in an important meeting...

175
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,760
I sent you an sms,
you never read them...

176
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,099
Should I read my transfer orders
now, or your messages?

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,504
Transfer... Oh no, not again!

178
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:12,802
Bloody...

179
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,037
Just a month away from retirement...

180
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,941
and they've transferred me
to bloody Animal Husbandry...

181
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:19,037
Animal what?

182
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:20,309
Husbandry...

183
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:22,419
It's under the Ministry
of Agriculture...

184
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:25,021
isn't there one decent
posting in my fate...

185
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,251
I will resign, today itself...

186
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:30,553
I'm going to write such a stinker
of a resignation letter,

187
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:32,559
lt'll shake up the whole
Government... you see...

188
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,860
Like you've sent any
of the resignation letters

189
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,297
that you wrote after
the last six transfers!

190
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,526
Ok!

191
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,398
This time I'll do it!

192
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:42,162
I'll send in the resignation...
you wait!

193
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,173
Ok bye... bye I love you

194
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:45,738
Hmm.. so

195
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,977
He's very jumpy ya...

196
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,636
More than normal?

197
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:52,177
Animal husbandry ya!
Not fair no...

198
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,683
I know, poor animals...

199
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,518
But when he's in a better mood,

200
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:58,214
you have to come over officially,
to ask for my hand in marriage.

201
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,822
Hello... I'm not coming over
to ask for your hand!

202
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,893
I can't do this please...

203
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,287
Please ask for my hand...
He is old school.

204
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:08,924
He'll be happy, we'll be happy.

205
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,533
I love you.

206
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:12,101
You know how to get me
to do everything..

207
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,170
..and anything just
by saying 'I love you'

208
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:16,205
I love you...
- Ditto.

209
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,741
Gursharan... Dictation...

210
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,977
Sir, dictation...now?

211
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,776
We need to vacate this office
and shift to Animal Husbandry, Sir!

212
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:28,408
No, first dictation.

213
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:29,747
Come here.
- Sir!

214
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,546
To the Honourable Cabinet Secretary,

215
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,884
etc etc ...

216
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,891
Subject... Resignation...

217
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,291
Dear Sir...

218
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:42,423
Gursharan don't ever
let your son do IAS.

219
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,193
Sir, he's very interested.

220
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,565
He is fully preparing
for the entrance exam...

221
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:47,365
But he's just twelve...

222
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,407
Sir, only if he starts
now will he be in the IAS.

223
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,566
And he'll keep getting
pushed around like me!

224
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,270
No Sir, my son is very bright,

225
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:56,404
he will definitely reach the top...

226
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:57,973
And I'm not bright?

227
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,709
No no...
You are very bright sir,

228
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,648
you are shining bright.

229
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,618
You came fifty eighth in
the All India entrance exam Sir.

230
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,521
Only if there was some smartness

231
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:10,219
to go with the brightness Sir...

232
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,719
You mean, ''fill my pockets then

233
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,764
I will do your work''
kind of brightness...

234
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:18,599
If I had that I'd have gone
very far, right?

235
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:19,634
Right...

236
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,794
Wrong Sir...

237
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:22,832
Filling of pockets very wrong sir.

238
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,838
Hmm...

239
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,636
That's why, I've encouraged
my daughter since nursery

240
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:28,609
to take up a job
in the private sector...

241
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:32,015
Mayera's salary at
this point is more than

242
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,980
What I get after thirty-five
years of service...

243
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,040
You write...

244
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,312
Dear sir,
I have to bring to your notice...

245
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:40,152
Sir one humble opinion sir...
- Yes?

246
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,487
Sir, you're just a month
away from retirement...

247
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,060
Why resign?...

248
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:45,794
You'll lose your pension sir...

249
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,521
It's just a matter of one month...

250
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,659
But as per your dictation...

251
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:53,736
What dictation...

252
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,301
Let us shift office...

253
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:56,929
Let's move to Animal Husbandry...

254
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:02,403
Shit shit shit, it's ten thirty...

255
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,411
papa's gonna kill me

256
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,504
Listen...

257
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:07,116
I will come with you,
he wont lose it in front of me...

258
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,515
Really?
- Of course!

259
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:12,187
Let him just try saying
something to you...

260
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:14,247
Osama, Obama whatever-
don't worry I'll sort everything...

261
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,549
Of course.

262
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:17,059
What is he... a dinosaur?

263
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,195
Who sets deadlines these days?

264
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,387
I'm not afraid of anyone, ok!

265
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:22,762
Mayera...

266
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,261
How many times have I told you...

267
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:27,633
Sir there's very very
very bad traffic out...

268
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:29,238
Is anyone talking to you?

269
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,465
No, right?

270
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:31,596
Who is this?

271
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:33,334
Mohit Chaddha papa, my friend!

272
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,604
That's me.

273
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,705
He'd got you cake
and wine on New Year's eve...

274
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,283
Come on papa,
he was here on my birthday...

275
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,784
he'd got me those expensive shoes,

276
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:46,220
and you'd said what kind of
fool gifts shoes on a birthday...

277
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:48,988
We had a fight over that...

278
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,926
Oh... right... airline boy...

279
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,991
Right... Air Connect...
Junior Ex...

280
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:55,929
Senior Mayera, Senior...
have you forgotten?

281
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,091
Sorry!

282
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,963
How dare you reprimand my daughter!

283
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:03,606
Err.. ma'am...

284
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,303
Senior what?
- Sorry?

285
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:10,642
Senior peon, senior clerk,

286
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,648
senior typist, senior what?

287
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:13,977
Senior executive sir ...

288
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:17,214
So good night Mr. Senior...
it's very late,

289
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:18,618
I'm sure you're sleepy too.

290
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:21,089
No no... Not really sir ...
Do you like cars sir?

291
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,182
I've bought a new one
...it's automatic ...

292
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:24,888
Would you like to check it out?

293
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:26,154
It's so cool!

294
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,426
Mayera...

295
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:35,805
Thank you for dropping
my daughter...

296
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:37,703
Good night...

297
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:40,000
God damn these executives...

298
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:42,372
Bloody Osama!

299
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,585
Chill it's me..

300
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,655
Now what?
- I love you

301
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:53,815
Ditto

302
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,100
Mayeru I love you,
but today is Sunday!

303
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,968
Get up...
we're going on a picnic...

304
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,664
Are you good at Frisbee?

305
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:13,740
Flush? Three two five?
- Three two what?

306
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,607
Never mind,
it's a card game, I'll teach you...

307
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,374
You reach Humayun's Tomb by ten.

308
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,381
You're wasting my Sunday on a picnic?

309
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,950
No way!

310
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:24,316
Mohit, papa is in
a good mood after ages...

311
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,855
he's retiring in two days...

312
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:27,891
God knows how jumpy
he'll be then...

313
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,652
If you want to marry me,

314
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:32,126
you have to ask for my hand... Ok?

315
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,528
Picnic?!

316
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,227
Ask for my hand...

317
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:42,128
How can I?
- Go... ask...

318
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,604
Oye Mohit!
- Sir

319
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,074
Give me a hand boy... please
- Coming sir

320
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:48,338
Just fix this...
- Sir right away...

321
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:51,511
Hmm that's it. Just press it down.

322
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:52,946
Trying sir

323
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,549
Bloody Duffer

324
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:03,718
Mohit...
- Yes Sir!

325
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:05,021
Once again...

326
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,507
It's just a frog, not a crocodile...

327
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:22,612
What a coward he is!

328
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,142
Ohh... so nice of you sir.

329
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:33,615
Mayera ready
- Thank you... welcome...

330
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,256
Ask for my hand...

331
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:37,985
What are you thinking so much for...

332
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,050
Why aren't you asking?

333
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,158
Ask for my hand...

334
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,356
What are you doing?
- I can't do it

335
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:43,296
Ask for my hand...
- I can't do it

336
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,566
What are you two whispering about...

337
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:47,865
Are you cheating...you two?

338
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:48,996
No, no...

339
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:51,472
I'm telling him,
to ask you for the hand...

340
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:54,536
Yes yes... he lost the last hand...

341
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,973
ok ask...

342
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:58,013
Come ask for the hand...

343
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:01,046
Sir, I...
I was just wondering that...

344
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:03,550
Sir I was saying will you please...

345
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:07,751
Give me the third last card...

346
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:09,381
Third last...

347
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,221
One, two,

348
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:15,190
is this it?

349
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,233
Ace... that's an ace...
Ace Mayera...

350
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:18,733
Oh bloody Ace.
I am not playing this game.

351
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:20,099
You bloody cheats.

352
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,161
I'm going for a walk..
You bloody cheaters...

353
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,796
All cheaters.
- What's wrong with you...

354
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,168
You just have to ask for my hand.

355
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,640
You can't do this much?

356
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,413
Humayun's wife got this tomb built.

357
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:39,316
After that Shahjehan got
the same made in white marble...

358
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,550
for his missus, madam Mumtaz.

359
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,785
Taj Mahal, Agra.
- Yes Sir... Agra..

360
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:45,323
And after the Taj Mahal,

361
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,953
such a grand tomb was never built.

362
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:48,587
You know why?
- Why?

363
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,166
All the craftsmen
who made the Taj...

364
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,964
you know, the workers...

365
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:56,265
Shahjehan lined them up,

366
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,274
took out his sword and whack,

367
00:16:58,342 --> 00:16:59,741
cut off their hands...

368
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:01,804
...I mean it was a mean thing to do

369
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,072
but having said that..
You know I think.

370
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,239
Papa, Mohit wants to marry me...

371
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:07,674
What?
- Didn't you hear me?

372
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:09,149
What did you say?

373
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:12,313
Not me, Mohit... Go ahead Mohit...

374
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,118
Sir... sir I love you ...

375
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,225
I mean ...
I love your daughter Mayera ...

376
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:18,522
Humayun's tomb or Taj Mahal,

377
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:20,028
even my love will
stay rock solid like

378
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:21,928
these monuments for
centuries and centuries...

379
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,556
Sir, you quoted the
hand cutting incident,

380
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,624
but I want to ask for
your daughter's hand Sir...

381
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,201
I want to marry her.

382
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,635
Oh papa... why are you packing up?

383
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:34,301
We've not even eaten dessert...

384
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:36,369
Papa makes very good 'halwa'...

385
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:38,881
Papa... crap...

386
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,119
Papa... papa wait...

387
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,748
Pick that up...

388
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:46,683
Papa, Mohit asked you for something,

389
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:48,349
at least give him an answer...

390
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,222
Mohit come on...

391
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:51,689
Papa...

392
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,423
Mohit say something!

393
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,088
Sir at least talk to us...

394
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,765
Sir we so coolly asking
you for permission...

395
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,597
others just elope and get married...

396
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:00,930
Mohit!

397
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,638
You want to marry him... him...

398
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,476
he's talking about eloping...
criminal minded.

399
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,212
Don't even think about it!

400
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,215
The Home Secretary is my batch mate,

401
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:22,314
the Police Commissioner
of Delhi sends me naughty sms's...

402
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:27,454
I can trap you in such a case,
you'll keep rotting in jail...

403
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,529
Bloody!

404
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,098
Papa

405
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,302
Uday Singh...
- Sir.

406
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,137
Put all this in the car...

407
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:42,745
and the rest of the stuff from
that boy's hands...

408
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:44,781
Check everything before we leave...
Come on Mayera...

409
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:47,008
No... first say yes...

410
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,209
We'll go home and talk please...

411
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:54,548
Look Mayera, the entire IAS crowd
shows up here to picnic...

412
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:56,181
if this news spreads
in the ministry...

413
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,386
there will be unnecessary gossip...
So come...

414
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:03,766
Ok then,
I will never speak to you again.

415
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,134
Mayera!
- Come on Uday Singh.

416
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:12,401
Sir.

417
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:22,175
Good girl,
I'll solve all your problems.

418
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,411
Don't worry!

419
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,586
Come on.

420
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,270
What is this? Emotional blackmail?

421
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,105
What emotional blackmail?

422
00:19:49,513 --> 00:19:51,504
It's just saffron chicken biryani,

423
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:54,911
and then some delicious,
sweet halwa... that's all.

424
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,746
You think you'll make
my favourite dishes

425
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,081
and get me to agree?

426
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,347
Forget it!

427
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:01,320
Ok..ok...
just enjoy your chicken biryani

428
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,619
and forget that bloody loser.

429
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:05,460
Papa he's a Senior executive!

430
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,688
So... how does that matter?

431
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,994
A senior executive doesn't
own the company, does he?

432
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,897
How does that matter...
as long as he loves me...

433
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:13,799
Nothing happens with love...

434
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:15,132
Love is everything..

435
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:17,069
Love is everything..

436
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,466
If I didn't have your love
after mummy died..

437
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:20,907
..what would I have done?

438
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:22,975
Why did you play mummy's role too?

439
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,172
The other IAS daddy's ...

440
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,806
spent their evenings at
the club with their friends...

441
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:29,215
but you stayed home
to play with me and my toys.

442
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:32,419
There was no money, but I had you,

443
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,887
I had your love.

444
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,252
That was enough for me.

445
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,189
Just like Mohit's love
is enough for me.

446
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:38,884
What more do you need for happiness?

447
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,123
Money! You need money...

448
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:44,032
And I'm saying this from experience.

449
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,795
Look, I had a government job..

450
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:49,099
l-A-S, I had a big post
but empty pockets.

451
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:52,136
All my life I have
been depriving you...

452
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:55,207
never gave you the pocket money..

453
00:20:55,345 --> 00:20:57,370
or clothes or toys you deserved...

454
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,773
You wanted to go
to the U.S. for an MBA,

455
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,316
I couldn't even give you that.

456
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:05,687
But now I'll get you
married to a rich boy

457
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,413
who can make your every
wish come true...

458
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:11,561
And you'll refuse my biggest wish?

459
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,186
Yes... but Mohit
is an absolute no...

460
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:16,925
Who's asking you to blindly
get married to just anyone?

461
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,962
I have a whole file,
go ahead and choose yourself,

462
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:22,936
each one has at least a turn over
of twenty five crores... yes.

463
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:25,764
Papa... I'm going to marry Mohit!

464
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,812
Fine... then do what you want...

465
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:32,847
Whether I live, I die, I'm sad,
I'm unhappy, what do you care...

466
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:39,087
Mohit ya... papa is not
ready to listen at all...

467
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:42,491
he's being so stubborn!

468
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:07,643
Fourteenth floor please...

469
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:16,621
Do you know Mohit Chaddha?

470
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:19,550
From marketing?

471
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,392
How is his character?

472
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,895
Mohit sir,
he's always stuck to one madam..

473
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,299
Always stuck to madam?

474
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:29,269
She comes here too...
no scoop, no scandal.

475
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:31,331
But why are you enquiring about him?

476
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:33,534
Survey ... Family planning!

477
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:36,975
Mohit Chaddha.
- I was passing by your office...

478
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:39,038
had some work...
let's have a cup of coffee?

479
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,707
Who the hell are you?

480
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,747
I'm Sehgal...
- Sehgal, who?

481
00:22:44,054 --> 00:22:45,681
Sehgal from Income Tax...

482
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,245
I've come to file a case on you...

483
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:49,458
Sir but I have filed
all my tax returns...

484
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,923
I'm Mayera's father Sehgal,
you bloody...

485
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:57,929
I'm calling from
your office reception.

486
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:00,692
So sorry Sir...
I couldn't recognize your voice,

487
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,829
because I was talking to you
for the first time on the phone...

488
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:05,264
Sir, you had some work here?

489
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:07,035
What's your salary?

490
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,142
Sir Sixty five thousand.

491
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:10,338
Sixty five only!

492
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,608
Sir my Hindi counting
is a bit weak... Sir.

493
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:14,911
Your salary is even weaker...

494
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,086
My daughter, Mayera...
Seventy two...

495
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:21,414
her salary is seventy
two thousand...

496
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:23,321
I know Sir... so proud of her...

497
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:24,621
You know!

498
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,758
What kind of a man are you?

499
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:30,863
My daughter's salary is more
than yours and you have no problem?

500
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:32,265
Come on Sir, what problem...

501
00:23:32,335 --> 00:23:34,269
I love her and she loves me...
It's all cool!

502
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:37,306
Look Mr. sixty five, sit here...

503
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:42,043
you know that song about
'let the love never be less,

504
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:45,509
I will take every other loss',
is all nonsense.

505
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:49,108
I don't know from which
angle you look good to Mayera.

506
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:51,745
Till I don't give my approval,

507
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,719
Mayera will not marry you.

508
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:54,949
You know that right?

509
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:02,858
So your probation, your inquiry
period starts from today...

510
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:06,927
During this probation,
I will examine your every molecule.

511
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:10,735
If I don't detect
any problem in you,

512
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,898
I will say yes for the wedding.

513
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:17,806
But if I find anything
wrong and I reject you,

514
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:21,008
then I want no
complication from you.

515
00:24:21,117 --> 00:24:22,311
Understand Mr. Sixty five?

516
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:24,182
Just vanish, quietly...

517
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:25,952
You ready for it now?

518
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,448
How can I agree, just like that?

519
00:24:28,992 --> 00:24:32,223
You will take the exam
and give the result as well...

520
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,458
I don't think I stand
any chance of passing...

521
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:36,395
You have no faith in yourself?

522
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,533
I have full faith
in myself... but...

523
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,660
But? You think I'll cheat?

524
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:41,930
Who knows...

525
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,802
It's not written
on anyone's face, is it?...

526
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,437
Look here you...

527
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:49,503
I was being polite
and pretending to give you a choice,

528
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:51,973
actually you have no choice.

529
00:24:52,215 --> 00:24:55,275
If you're ready to go on
probation speak up,

530
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,282
or forget Mayera. Forever.

531
00:24:58,354 --> 00:25:00,720
Bloody fool!
- I am ready Sir.

532
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:03,790
Sir.

533
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:05,019
Good.

534
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:07,757
Mayera was saying
you have no family,

535
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:09,888
your parents died a long time ago.

536
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,964
Then at least if I reject you,

537
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:15,093
your family won't be insulted.

538
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:16,832
Let's go.

539
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,467
Sir, you had come for coffee..
we serve some awesome capp...

540
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:21,567
Another thing,

541
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,805
if you're not interested in sports,
then get interested...

542
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,609
Sports is my middle name sir.

543
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:27,673
TT, Tennis, squash.. anything.

544
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,848
Squash?!
- Squash!

545
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:40,593
Listen... Papa hates to lose...

546
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:42,790
he will never let me get married
to a man who defeats him...

547
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,400
He's testing me. If I play badly...

548
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,929
Trust me Mohit. If you win today
you will lose forever.

549
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,539
Hey, come on...

550
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,106
Best of luck

551
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,284
Ready?

552
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:20,567
Oh no...

553
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,740
Go go Mohit

554
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:44,820
Shot!

555
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:46,459
Go papa!

556
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:49,397
Poor guy...

557
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,962
Service!

558
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:54,466
The ball has to be
picked up like this...

559
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,313
Game!

560
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,953
Well done...

561
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:12,987
very good...

562
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,523
Well played sir ... good one.

563
00:27:14,657 --> 00:27:16,215
How were you playing!?
- Super papa super!

564
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:18,453
I beat you in three straight games.

565
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:20,494
Sports is my middle name.

566
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:21,855
You lied, right?

567
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,058
I hate lies. Ask Mayera.

568
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:25,395
Papa hates lies.

569
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:27,493
Where did you find this guy?

570
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,698
There are at least seven
boys in my file

571
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,672
who've played
national level football,

572
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:34,039
Badminton, tennis and cricket!

573
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:35,201
Papa please.

574
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:36,676
You are hopeless yes, hopeless!

575
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,974
Absolutely hopeless. Miserable.

576
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,777
You must practice with me, daily.

577
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:44,783
Chances are slim but
if there is some improvement,

578
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:47,080
we will see.
Tomorrow same time, here.

579
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,055
Sir tomorrow I have...
- Tomorrow what?

580
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:51,984
He'll come papa... he'll come.

581
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:53,555
Hmmm...

582
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,992
Get my kit,
I'm going to the locker room.

583
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:01,101
Oh god!

584
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:02,329
I am telling you...

585
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,803
I'm not going to leave you,

586
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,771
whatever he might do.
Your Papa Osama!

587
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:10,310
Oh yeah!?

588
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:13,539
What?
The staff has called me... why?

589
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:14,707
Please just come...
- Sir..

590
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:17,285
..a small farewell
gift from all of us.

591
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:18,650
Oh, what was the need for this...

592
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:20,848
Sir it's just a little something..
- Gursharan..

593
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,589
..oh... thank you so much

594
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:23,989
Please open it sir, open it...

595
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,288
Ok...

596
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:28,294
Just a minute sir..

597
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:30,456
Here it is!

598
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:32,328
What is this?

599
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:35,733
Sir, your retired life
begins tomorrow,

600
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:37,238
right?
- So?

601
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:39,797
You wont be going out as much,

602
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:41,842
your movement will
be quite restricted sir...

603
00:28:41,944 --> 00:28:44,708
So?
- This is for your fitness.

604
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:46,543
It helped me a lot...

605
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,880
one, two and three...

606
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,482
Amazing isn't it Sir?

607
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,490
Th th th thank you...

608
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:59,252
P p p please stop this...
- Welcome Sir, welcome!

609
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,954
It's a strange gift..

610
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:03,156
but the entire staff
got together for it.

611
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:05,900
Now I must get them something
in return, shouldn't I?

612
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:08,060
Sir, including the peons..

613
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,832
there are seventeen
staff members...

614
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,667
How will you get
something for everyone?

615
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:14,801
Lets get one thing
that is of use to everyone!

616
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:16,276
How may I help you sir?

617
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,438
These seem very big and expensive,

618
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:22,416
can you show us a medium sized TV?

619
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,144
Sure sir... This way

620
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,820
Sir, are you looking
for a specific brand?

621
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:29,483
Something cheap,
charming and long-lasting...

622
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,491
Breaking news.

623
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,585
The turbulence in the Airline
Industry has grounded many...

624
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:35,458
Sir this is our
smallest 22 inch LCD...

625
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:36,596
Increase the volume please...

626
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:39,133
For the last two years,
airline companies have been bearing

627
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,260
the brunt of the unreliable markets.

628
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:43,737
But Air Connect is
the first company that

629
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:47,572
has ousted 1200 employees at one go.

630
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:49,167
That's right, 1200!

631
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:51,838
Cabin crew, technical, ground,

632
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:53,848
marketing staff included.

633
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,178
Marketing!

634
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,057
She's not answering her phone...

635
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:11,265
Neither is Mohit...

636
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,096
Gursharan, Mohit's job is gone!

637
00:30:14,237 --> 00:30:15,602
Congratulations Sir.
- Thank you,

638
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:16,933
and congratulations to you too...

639
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,108
This will be your apartment,
sea facing,

640
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,107
on the Dubai Marina...

641
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:22,872
One of the most posh
localities in Dubai.

642
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:23,911
It has four bedrooms...

643
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,912
Look at the kitchen...

644
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:25,979
Look at this.

645
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,913
Rent is totally paid by the company,

646
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:29,413
plus double salary.

647
00:30:29,552 --> 00:30:32,988
Mind you in UAE dirham
and overseas perks...

648
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:34,884
Sir, what if I say no?

649
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:36,390
I'll send you to a mental asylum.

650
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:39,658
Sir I'm going to get married...

651
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:41,424
Oh wow, really? Mohit?

652
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:42,429
Yeah.

653
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:44,590
Well I didn't think you would
refuse such a great offer,

654
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:45,964
to get married.

655
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:49,071
Sir we love each other,
we can't stay apart.

656
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,764
I am really sorry Sir. Thank you.

657
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,570
Wait, don't you want to see
what car they're offering you?

658
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:56,245
Sir I am really Sorry... but

659
00:30:58,514 --> 00:30:59,606
Yeah ...

660
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:03,917
Your papa is here?

661
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,248
Papa?

662
00:31:05,888 --> 00:31:07,150
Papa!

663
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:10,757
Mayeru!

664
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:14,892
Mayeru? Are you feeling ok?

665
00:31:14,964 --> 00:31:16,124
Are you ok?

666
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,759
I'm ok.

667
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,460
Mohit has lost his
job and you're ok?

668
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,969
Mohit lost his job?

669
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:23,265
Didn't you watch the news?

670
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:26,500
If a big company like Air
Connect couldn't save its employees,

671
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:28,304
then what about the smaller ones?

672
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:29,810
Demands for safe and secure jobs

673
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:31,540
in the Government
are increasing...

674
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:36,482
Applications for Civil Services entrance exams have risen by 21%...

675
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:39,350
In these tough times of recession,
private company jobs are...

676
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:49,791
When he had a job,
I was willing to compromise.

677
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:54,097
But I will die before I
let you marry a jobless man...

678
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,432
Please understand this...

679
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:58,099
It's over!
- Mohit ...

680
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,238
Hey Mayera, lmmy here...

681
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:04,538
Mohit, you haven't
lost your job have you?

682
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:06,338
Hey... this is lmmy!

683
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:07,981
Tell me seriously ...

684
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:11,249
Honestly ya, I'm lmmy speaking.

685
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,979
Mohit has gone to
fight with the boss,

686
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,420
he left his phone behind.

687
00:32:14,824 --> 00:32:15,916
So everything is safe?

688
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,994
Yes, my job is safe...
but Mohit's is gone...

689
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:20,119
What?

690
00:32:20,263 --> 00:32:22,493
See I told you... I told you

691
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,790
Thank God.

692
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,027
I'm so relieved
that your job is safe.

693
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:29,799
I know ya,
but really sad about Mohit...

694
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:31,372
Even papa was so worried.

695
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,102
He came to my office!
He's right here.

696
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,507
Mayera are you okay?

697
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:37,704
Okay bye. I Love you.

698
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:41,046
Papa please go home and rest now.

699
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:43,242
I have to attend
a very important meeting.

700
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,020
Papa, Mohit has not lost his job

701
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,214
and neither will he ever lose it.

702
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:49,723
We will get married
and he will be very successful.

703
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:51,816
Ok come on. Bye.

704
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:54,420
No... look..
- Bye.

705
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,725
I heard them say myself...
all the marketing guys..

706
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,528
listen... marketing...

707
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,932
Oh God!

708
00:33:03,673 --> 00:33:05,163
Look I'm sorry about this.

709
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,673
But I was just promoted!

710
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:08,400
What can I say Mohit.

711
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:12,880
The salary you get after promotion
can save the jobs of three people.

712
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,549
I don't know... consider this
a sacrifice for your juniors.

713
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:17,278
Why don't you sacrifice?

714
00:33:17,353 --> 00:33:20,379
Your salary could save
the jobs of at least eight people.

715
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:21,581
People who don't know anything
about Operations,

716
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:22,851
shouldn't be sitting tight as CEOs!

717
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:25,359
Just watch it Mohit...
there's no need to be rude!

718
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:27,385
If I'd been allowed
to run Air Connect,

719
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:29,123
I wouldn't let the company even
in this time of recession

720
00:33:29,231 --> 00:33:30,630
lose a single penny...

721
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:33,092
In fact I was going to quit myself...

722
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:34,466
because you guys don't deserve me.

723
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,400
What?

724
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:36,766
I am too good for you...

725
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,303
bunch of idiots!

726
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:40,901
How dare you call me an idiot!

727
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:43,240
Like this...
I'll get a job like this...

728
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,610
Double salary... mark my words.

729
00:33:46,282 --> 00:33:47,977
Mohit you better come
back and say sorry...

730
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,142
Mohit!

731
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,876
Mohit relax...
don't get so agitated.

732
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:52,715
What did she say?
- What will she say?

733
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:54,388
You say thank you to me,
I've saved your job.

734
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,318
How did you?

735
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:56,824
I was promoted, I was sacked...

736
00:33:56,892 --> 00:33:57,950
If you'd been promoted,
you'd have gone!

737
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,687
Thanks bro...
- Come on, buy me a beer.

738
00:33:59,762 --> 00:34:00,751
No beer right now.

739
00:34:00,863 --> 00:34:01,955
Stay with everyone, shout slogans,

740
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:04,430
what if they are pressured
into withdrawing the orders...

741
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,462
Why don't you say sorry to the boss?

742
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:08,360
I've never said sorry
to anyone in my life,

743
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,428
why should I say it to this moron?!
C'mon, buy me a beer.

744
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,666
Okay, okay, don't say sorry...

745
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:12,900
But the media is
very hot right now...

746
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,636
news channels are gathering here...

747
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,377
at least give interviews, get famous
and I'll check out the girls.

748
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:21,450
We want our jobs back...

749
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,280
We want our jobs back...

750
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:28,414
We're telecasting from outside
the Air Connect offices...

751
00:34:28,557 --> 00:34:32,084
give us our jobs back...
- People are really worried,

752
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:34,196
and here with me
is Mr lmran Rizvi...

753
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:36,697
Mr lmran Rizvi,
how are you feeling?

754
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,927
Very bad...
- Can you tell us in detail...

755
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:40,764
How did you feel
when you lost your job?

756
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:42,963
I haven't lost my job,
my job is safe...

757
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,164
Stop stop...

758
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:46,672
If you haven't lost your job then
why are you giving this interview?

759
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:50,235
Because my friend here
lost his job...

760
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:51,980
How are you feeling?

761
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:57,919
Scared...
- I am sorry, what was that?

762
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,146
He says he's scared...

763
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:01,280
Scared... what are you scared of?

764
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,892
For Mayera...
- Mayera... Mayera your sister...

765
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:07,292
who will commit suicide
if she doesn't get married, right?

766
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,421
If you use even one shot of his,
I will sue you...

767
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:11,660
come away from here...

768
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,366
What did you say your name was...

769
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:18,437
Why were you giving an interview?

770
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,700
Everyone was...

771
00:35:20,142 --> 00:35:21,575
Is everyone getting married?

772
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:23,077
Is everyone's father my papa?

773
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:25,545
With such difficulty I've convinced
him that your job is safe...

774
00:35:25,614 --> 00:35:27,411
if he sees this interview,
he will never let us be married...

775
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:28,881
So let him not ya...

776
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,180
I'm fed up of his
terms and conditions...

777
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,286
There's a world economic crisis on,

778
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:37,185
the recession has killed
the airlines industry,

779
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,951
the company I work
for is bankrupt today...

780
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:43,828
Mayera, I'm jobless...

781
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:48,570
and you're worried about
the lie you've told your father!

782
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:01,909
Mohit... please don't panic.

783
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,851
You're so smart...

784
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,887
You'll get a job immediately.

785
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:09,520
But one lie will
save our relationship.

786
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,428
To hide one lie,
one has to tell a hundred others...

787
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,571
I know ...

788
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:35,814
Come on, let's get out of here.

789
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:41,746
Hello... I'd like to speak to..

790
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,449

Secretary to the Govt of India...

793
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:49,690
Now retired...

794
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,064
Hey Khattar. VK speaking...

795
00:36:54,303 --> 00:36:55,099
How're you doing?

796
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,296
Ok listen.

797
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:57,735
I have a favour to ask...

798
00:36:57,806 --> 00:36:59,467
I need you to
investigate a guy...

799
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:00,701
write the name down...

800
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:03,470
Mohit Chaddha,

801
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,377
Yes Mohit Chadha.

802
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:09,414
Murder, rape, robbery, molesting,

803
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:13,520
eve teasing, rioting,
sending dirty texts...

804
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:17,388
Or any other public offence
or criminal activity...

805
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,393
Please report to me...

806
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:21,395
It's a matter of
life and death for me.

807
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:29,771
Hello, yes sir?

808
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:31,830
Where are you?
- At the office.

809
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:33,203
Whose office?

810
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:34,833
Sir, my office.

811
00:37:34,944 --> 00:37:36,502
Then why are you whispering?

812
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:38,012
Sir I'm in a meeting,
shall I call you back?

813
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:40,104
I'm retired, not useless...

814
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,183
You think I have
nothing better to do?

815
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,648
I'm a busy man, I have no time...

816
00:37:45,254 --> 00:37:46,585
Ok, do one thing.

817
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,053
Give me your Pan Card number.

818
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:50,723
Sir why do you want
my Pan Card number?

819
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:52,055
Why?

820
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:55,462
If you want to marry my daughter,

821
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:58,991
I have full right to ask
for your Pan Card number.

822
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:01,568
And if you don't
have a Pan Card number,

823
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:05,068
you have no right to marry
my daughter... do you understand?

824
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,903
No, no Sir...
I'll give you my Pan Card number...

825
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:08,034
I'm giving you my Pan Card number.

826
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:11,112
And your Passport number,
Voter ID Card number,

827
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,045

828
00:38:13,148 --> 00:38:16,049
and most importantly
your Identity Card number...

829
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:18,346
I want it all! Got it?
- Yes sir

830
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,578
Ok, now bring the photocopies
of all documents

831
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:22,281
..to the gymkhana this evening.

832
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:25,622
And remember,
without document verification,

833
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:27,855
the marriage is cancelled.

834
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:33,194
Mr Chaddha... you may please go in.
- Yeah.

835
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,031
Trainee! Are you serious?

836
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:38,600
Sir I was a senior
executive at Air Connect.

837
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,504
And they fired you.

838
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:42,438
I'm at least giving
you a trainee's position

839
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:43,943
and you are not even thankful.

840
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,273
Oh, thank you so much sir.

841
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:46,780
I think I deserve much better.

842
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:50,214
Where will you find something
better in this worst-case scenario?

843
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:53,880
I will, I will get much better...

844
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,514

- Fill up the tank...

00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:20,078
What's wrong with selling lingerie?

855
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,977
Inner Beauty is even
offering a higher salary..

856
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:24,643
and before papa finds out.

857
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:25,720
I don't want to take

00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,570
Sorry.

893
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:29,100
The posters of dreams,

894
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:30,873
Can be seen in day-;ight.

895
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:32,776
;n co;ourfu; packets,

896
00:41:32,848 --> 00:41:34,577
They are so;d in markets.

897
00:41:34,683 --> 00:41:36,514
;f we can he;p it,

898
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:38,246
And if it's on sa;e.

899
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:40,218
We wi;; not ;eave
the moon and stars,

900
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,984
We wi;; buy them without fai;.

901
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:45,618
We make sense of nonsense.

902
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:49,356
We ;augh at our sorrows.

903
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:52,889
We are not a;one in this game,

904
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:57,496
The who;e wor;d is p;aying,
just the same.

905
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:01,007
Our pockets are
fi;;ed with good times...

906
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:04,670
Our on;y wea;th, good times...

907
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,477
They strut, they shine, good times...

908
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,986
They f;y in sty;e, good times...

909
00:42:12,054 --> 00:42:17,082
Good times, they f;y...

910
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:49,719
Why shou;d we think of tomorrow,
today?

911
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,722
This moment is enough to ;ive in.

912
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:57,526
That which we have
not seen ourse;ves,

913
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,228
Why shou;d we be;ieve in?

914
00:43:01,303 --> 00:43:03,100
Not years,

915
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,968
Things happen in a moment...

916
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,601
Like nood;es, everything is instant.

917
00:43:08,677 --> 00:43:10,542
Joys are momentary...

918
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:12,375
They are transitory...

919
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:16,508
A;; you have to do
is ask and you get them-

920
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:20,412
Our pockets are
fi;;ed with good times...

921
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:24,083
Our on;y wea;th, good times...

922
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:27,753
They strut, they shine, good times...

923
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:31,390
They f;y in sty;e, good times...

924
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:36,426
Good times, they f;y...

925
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:59,592
Mr. Chaddha!
You may Please go in ...

926
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,327

927
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,402
Yes Sir... But Sir..

928
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:11,503
Shit!

929
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,733
Mr. Chaddha! Mr. Chaddha...
He ran away sir...

930
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,365
Pickup Pickup Pickup
Pickup Pickup...

931
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:17,468
Immy man, I'm so screwed..

932
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:19,204
Alright, listen up guys...

933
00:44:19,314 --> 00:44:20,804
Mohit's dad-in-law
is coming to office.

934
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:24,215
So just pretend like
Mohit still works here. Ok?

935
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,983
Ok?
- Ok

936
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:28,347
Nice!

937
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:36,030
C'mon move ahead...

938
00:44:36,098 --> 00:44:38,464
Is it your father's wedding...
Yes, move it back...

939
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,577
Come on! Move the car!

940
00:44:54,016 --> 00:44:55,506
Move a little ahead.

941
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:57,843
What's going on man?
- Don't know man...

942
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,679
What's going on?

943
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,692
Oh... aunty..what is this...

944
00:45:06,228 --> 00:45:07,320
Let go off me please...

945
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,191
Brother, please...

946
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:15,132
Mohit Chaddha, 14th floor...

947
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:18,263
Thank you
- Yes Sir...

948
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,133
God...

949
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,702
Get to the side...

950
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:25,873
Move on...
What are you fighting over?

951
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:26,948
Will you take me?

952
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,243
I'm dead!

953
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:31,145
Hello sir.

954
00:45:31,553 --> 00:45:33,214
14th floor, please.

955
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,523
People came, people left...

956
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,752
But Mohit sir stayed
strong in his seat...

957
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:48,427
Hello sir.. how are you?

958
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:49,666
Who are you?

959
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:51,671
Sir I'm Mohit's best friend lmmy...

960
00:45:51,773 --> 00:45:53,104
OK..OK...
- Ya ya...

961
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:54,536
Mohit's cabin is that way...
- Sir not that way...

962
00:45:54,643 --> 00:45:56,577
sir coffee is this way...

963
00:45:57,412 --> 00:45:58,936
Sir lunch plan?

964
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,809
Son in law,

965
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:04,818
The mad... the mad...

966
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:06,717
the mad son in law...

967
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:08,620
Oh my God!

968
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:11,384
Isn't it funny?

969
00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:14,389
Sir, the boss has
called for Mohit...

970
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:16,791
Why don't you come to my cubicle...

971
00:46:16,898 --> 00:46:18,593
Sir you like Chinese food?

972
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,301
Going somewhere Mohit...

973
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,599
or have you come to apologize?

974
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,440
Mohit's cabin was somewhere here...
- It's on the other side!

975
00:46:30,645 --> 00:46:31,942
No, it's there...

976
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:33,773
Yes, this is it...

977
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:35,506
And you're here too...
- I am here...

978
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:36,914
Good job lmmy...

979
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:38,383
I will surely recommend
your name for a promotion...

980
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,317
Aah... No... no promotion.

981
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,787
I'm very happy in my cubicle.

982
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:44,485
Ok bye, see you. Bye.

983
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:46,988
Very irritating man...

984
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,454
I have to talk to you... come in...
- Sir over lunch?

985
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,626
Lunch?
- Ya

986
00:46:52,234 --> 00:46:54,293
Good idea... come on, lead the way.

987
00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:55,664
After you, please sir.

988
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:01,632
You have been fined
three times for driving offences,

989
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,440
once for breaking a signal...

990
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,540
and you always file your
IT returns after the due date.

991
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:13,987
Your US visa was refused
after the first attempt...

992
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:16,449
I'm sure something is wrong
with you only...

993
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,789
Otherwise one gets
it in the first attempt...

994
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:21,525
The detailed inquiry is in this...

995
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,727
RTO file, Income Tax,
Police inquiry, passport office.

996
00:47:26,801 --> 00:47:29,292
So many criminal cases.

997
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:32,170
How can I marry my daughter to you?

998
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,968
Sir, you did this
research all on your own?

999
00:47:36,711 --> 00:47:41,148
Obviously, it's a confidential
matter... what if it gets leaked?

1000
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:44,248
You are so cool Sir!

1001
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,520
Excuse me sir, but how
did the government let you go...

1002
00:47:48,924 --> 00:47:51,051
How could they retire you,
seriously...

1003
00:47:51,126 --> 00:47:53,458
It's a rule, retirement at sixty.

1004
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:55,223
It's a damn useless rule sir.

1005
00:47:55,363 --> 00:47:57,126
At sixty a guy comes into his own.

1006
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,232
There's a job opening
in our company,

1007
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:00,893
General Manager
Research and Analysis,

1008
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:02,334
age limit is seventy...

1009
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,369
Seventy?
- Salary, three lakhs...

1010
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,440
Teen lakh per annum?! Good

1011
00:48:07,142 --> 00:48:09,133
Spoken just like
a government official.

1012
00:48:09,277 --> 00:48:11,507
Three lakhs per month sir,
per month.

1013
00:48:13,315 --> 00:48:15,840
Three lakhs rupees per month..
- Ya.

1014
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:17,382
Your bill sir
- Thanks

1015
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,017
Let me..
- I insist sir.

1016
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:20,679
Sure... okay

1017
00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:24,787
Sir you are an unutilised
resource of this country...

1018
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:28,022
You are wasting the talent
and knowledge of V K Sehgal.

1019
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:30,025
Sir, guide youngsters like me,

1020
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,289
India needs you Sir...

1021
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:34,594
You can win the Padma Shri,
the Padma Vibhushan.

1022
00:48:34,669 --> 00:48:36,159
You could get an Oscar...

1023
00:48:36,304 --> 00:48:38,568
I mean you can definitely
get Bharat Ratna...

1024
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,700
Difficult to get the Arjun Award
by merely playing squash sir...

1025
00:48:42,644 --> 00:48:46,705
Yes... I'm not going
to sit idle at home...

1026
00:48:47,582 --> 00:48:50,050
I get many job offers, many...

1027
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:52,152
I have to take care
of something important,

1028
00:48:52,254 --> 00:48:53,744
then I will think about my job.

1029
00:48:53,888 --> 00:48:55,219
I'll think about it.

1030
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,817
Sorry sir your card
has been declined.

1031
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:00,686
What... something must be wrong

1032
00:49:00,762 --> 00:49:01,820
with your machine, try again...

1033
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,188
Sir you must go for it.

1034
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:04,390
Sir the machine is fine,

1035
00:49:04,499 --> 00:49:05,989
the transaction
is not being approved.

1036
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:07,999
Let me pay, I have my card.

1037
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:09,627
No no Sir, I have cash...

1038
00:49:12,674 --> 00:49:14,869
No sir, I don't have cash.

1039
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:15,772
No cash...

1040
00:49:15,844 --> 00:49:17,709
let me pay,
why you creating a scene...

1041
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:18,245
how much, how much is it?

1042
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:19,678
Sir, only two thousand
rupees more...

1043
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,908
I will just withdraw it
from the ATM and give it to you.

1044
00:49:20,982 --> 00:49:23,314
Two thousand... here it is.

1045
00:49:24,052 --> 00:49:25,178
Thank you sir.

1046
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,414
Sir who keeps
so much cash nowadays?

1047
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,224
How can Mayera be the
daughter of this terrorist?

1048
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:36,592
Always ready to drop a bomb!

1049
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:40,465
What?

1050
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,971
Shit!

1051
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:10,463
I don't know sir...
My credit card is not working...

1052
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:11,294
ATM card is not working...

1053
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:12,730
I am going to bloody
change my bank...

1054
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,199
What bank is your account in?

1055
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,533
That means you
didn't get the money?

1056
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:19,499
No...

1057
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,298
Are you bankrupt?

1058
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,505
Ha ha... so funny sir...

1059
00:50:23,745 --> 00:50:25,212
what a thing to say...
Not bankrupt sir...

1060
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,712
I'm in a hurry right now.

1061
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:29,676
This matter of offences is pending.

1062
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,252
Of course...
and I have to return your money...

1063
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,250
Squash at the club, this evening...

1064
00:50:35,357 --> 00:50:36,949
You better.
- Yeah.

1065
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:44,325
Hello...

1066
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:47,394
Yeah...

1067
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:49,927
Yes I will pay this
month's EMI by cheque...

1068
00:50:50,138 --> 00:50:51,696
Ok I will give you cash...

1069
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,829
Yes, I'll give
it to you tomorrow...

1070
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:55,501
I'm telling you I will...
Or else what?

1071
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,634
You'll take the car away?

1072
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:58,178
Take away your damn car then!

1073
00:51:00,715 --> 00:51:01,977
Hello Mayera...

1074
00:51:03,418 --> 00:51:04,885
Busy or what?

1075
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:08,054
Nothing ya, just needed some help...

1076
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:19,160
Here
- How much is it?

1077
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:20,757
Fifty thousand.

1078
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:22,502
I had asked for forty no?

1079
00:51:22,637 --> 00:51:24,696
Extra ten.. Pocket money.
- What pocket money?

1080
00:51:24,806 --> 00:51:26,671
Am I a kid to be given pocket money?

1081
00:51:26,808 --> 00:51:28,139
Of course you're a kid!

1082
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:30,700
All your money is over
and you didn't even know?

1083
00:51:30,812 --> 00:51:33,508
Listen, you should
maintain detailed accounts,

1084
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:35,412
I will check at
the end of each month.

1085
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,140
What do you mean by every month?

1086
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,615
You mean I'm such a big idiot

1087
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:41,416
that I won't find a job for months?

1088
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,081
If you're stuck on airlines,
then you surely won't get a job...

1089
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:46,157
I have mailed you a new job list.

1090
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:48,218
The Inner Beauty position
is still available.

1091
00:51:48,363 --> 00:51:51,332
If you get the job,
I will get free lingerie.

1092
00:51:51,633 --> 00:51:53,658
This is like saying
if I became a waiter,

1093
00:51:53,768 --> 00:51:54,894
you'll get free food...

1094
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,265
So Mayera ma'am,
what would you like to order today?

1095
00:51:57,338 --> 00:51:58,862
On today's menu
we have plain paratha,

1096
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,929
plain butter paratha,
plain ghee paratha,

1097
00:52:00,008 --> 00:52:01,134
aaloo paratha, aloo butter paratha,

1098
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:02,176
aloo ghee paratha, gobhi paratha,

1099
00:52:02,277 --> 00:52:03,471
gobhi butter paratha,
gobhi ghee paratha..

1100
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:05,103
Today's special is
mix vegetable paratha.

1101
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:06,544
Shut up you clown!

1102
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:08,239
I've left my meeting half way...
I have to go...

1103
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:09,816
Ok bye!

1104
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:17,283
Mayera!

1105
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:19,287
What?

1106
00:52:21,062 --> 00:52:22,791
What if I really become a waiter?

1107
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:25,161
Standing at the cross-roads,

1108
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,799
Will you marry a waiter?

1109
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,200
When someone asks a question.

1110
00:52:32,373 --> 00:52:34,603
You won't become a waiter.
- Why do a;; answers,

1111
00:52:34,676 --> 00:52:36,871
You never know...
- Seem unre;iab;e.

1112
00:52:37,045 --> 00:52:38,376
What if I have to?

1113
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:43,545
Nothing seems rea;

1114
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:45,084
Even then I'll marry you...

1115
00:52:45,353 --> 00:52:47,048
Now I really have
to get to work, ok...

1116
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:50,147
On these crossroads

1117
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:52,022
I love you

1118
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:58,994
Except an imaginary indifference.

1119
00:52:59,501 --> 00:53:05,269
Except an imaginary indifference.

1120
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:13,412
Except an imaginary indifference.

1121
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:35,853
Papa. Papa
- I am so sorry sir

1122
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,295
Are you ok?
- Papa are you okay?

1123
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:39,298
Yes I am
Yes darling I am ok.

1124
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:42,800
So ironical that you want
to marry the man..

1125
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,462
..who wants to make you an orphan!

1126
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:45,631
How wonderful is that?

1127
00:54:45,707 --> 00:54:47,402
Papa, don't over react...
please go and change, come on...

1128
00:54:47,508 --> 00:54:48,440
I am sorry sir!

1129
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,670
No problem,
sports is your middle name huh?

1130
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,410
Taking out your
frustrations on the ball?

1131
00:54:56,184 --> 00:54:58,311
I have tried all the
companies on your list,

1132
00:54:58,486 --> 00:55:01,080
looks like I'll have
to become a waiter after all.

1133
00:55:01,222 --> 00:55:02,746
Your girlfriend is too good...

1134
00:55:02,857 --> 00:55:04,722
I've already made a new list.

1135
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:06,693
Go and change now...

1136
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:08,957
Listen,

1137
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,655
what is this 'new job' tune that
you're teaching papa to sing?

1138
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:13,460
''I'll take on a job,
I'll take on a job'',

1139
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:14,865
he keeps saying excitedly.

1140
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:16,661
I've shut him up.

1141
00:55:17,171 --> 00:55:19,162
He's worked hard enough
for the last 35 years,

1142
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,105
from home to office and back again.

1143
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:22,540
He's worked very hard
all his life...

1144
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,271
It's his time to relax now.

1145
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:25,676
Why does he need to work anymore?

1146
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,407
I can take care of him.

1147
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:30,313
Don't hoist him again on the
'three lakh pay-package tower'

1148
00:55:30,418 --> 00:55:31,976
Ok, promise?

1149
00:55:32,186 --> 00:55:34,677
Ok...in any case,
who's going to hire him?

1150
00:55:34,756 --> 00:55:36,121
Very funny!

1151
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:40,623
Mohit... Hey Mohit
- Sir...

1152
00:55:40,695 --> 00:55:42,390
I'm ready for a new job.

1153
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,291
Sir Mayera has forbidden it.

1154
00:55:44,499 --> 00:55:45,761
Who's going to tell her?

1155
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,824
You frighten me all the time,
and now you'll lie yourself?

1156
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:50,233
Nobody is going to lie, you fool...

1157
00:55:50,304 --> 00:55:52,465
When I get the job,
we'll tell Mayera.

1158
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,938
Till then start job hunting for me.

1159
00:55:55,076 --> 00:55:55,872
Why should I?

1160
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,241
Because it was your idea,
you will do it.

1161
00:55:58,346 --> 00:56:00,644
No sir, I won't do it.
Mayera has categorically said no...

1162
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,409
OK, then the wedding is cancelled.

1163
00:56:03,484 --> 00:56:05,076
Go shower bloody...

1164
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:06,585
Osama!

1165
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:17,558
Hey Mohit.

1166
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,232
Let's send the application
by registered post.

1167
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,993
Post is so uncool.

1168
00:56:22,136 --> 00:56:24,434
You'll never get a job if you send
a letter in this day and age.

1169
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:26,769
Email sir, email.

1170
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:33,207
Actually, the real problem is that
I don't know how to use a laptop.

1171
00:56:33,314 --> 00:56:35,043
Not a big deal sir,
it works just like a computer.

1172
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:37,049
I don't even know how
to use computers!

1173
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:40,518
You don't know to use the computer?

1174
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:41,948
I don't ok...

1175
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,717
Do you know to make chicken biryani?

1176
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,191
You don't, right? Similarly
I don't know computers, that's it!

1177
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,557
Oh Sir...

1178
00:56:47,628 --> 00:56:48,925
Then for you Sir,
we'll have to look for one...

1179
00:56:48,996 --> 00:56:50,293
that even a fool can use.

1180
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:52,796
You called me a fool?

1181
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,262
You bloody fool!

1182
00:56:54,435 --> 00:56:55,800
Mayera!
- Where?

1183
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:56,495
Hello...

1184
00:56:56,637 --> 00:56:59,868
Yes, actually I'm in a meeting.

1185
00:57:00,274 --> 00:57:01,366
Yes in an interview...

1186
00:57:01,976 --> 00:57:03,068
Baby just listen...

1187
00:57:03,144 --> 00:57:04,270
I'll just call you back. Ok.

1188
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:05,845
Love you. Bye.

1189
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,012
Ok...You stop the car here.
Right here.

1190
00:57:08,082 --> 00:57:09,777
Sir here?
- I'm telling you, stop the car.

1191
00:57:09,851 --> 00:57:12,046
The house is ahead...
- You argue too much man...

1192
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,878
Sir but why?
- Again why!

1193
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:18,788
Do one thing-jump the wall,
then hide and cross the garden...

1194
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:22,761
Yes hide, and come in
through my bedroom window.

1195
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,263
Sir isn't this story absurd...

1196
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:27,261
Romeo hides from Juliet's
father and goes to meet her.

1197
00:57:27,335 --> 00:57:29,235
He doesn't hide form
Juliet to go meet her father.

1198
00:57:29,637 --> 00:57:32,162
Does Radha work in Juliet's house?
- No!

1199
00:57:32,273 --> 00:57:34,207
Radha will see Romeo,
she'll inform Juliet,

1200
00:57:34,308 --> 00:57:35,536
Juliet will ask her father

1201
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:37,373
'what was Romeo doing with you,
out of office,

1202
00:57:37,478 --> 00:57:39,275
in the middle of the afternoon'?

1203
00:57:39,881 --> 00:57:40,711
That's correct logic!

1204
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:41,839
So do it.
- Yeah.

1205
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:45,010
Let me send Radha
out for some work...

1206
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,883
Then I'll signal you to come inside.

1207
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:48,113
Got it Commando?

1208
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:50,052
Aye Aye Captain!
- Roger!

1209
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:51,452
Bloody hell.

1210
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:57,895
Radha, Radha!
- Yes papaji

1211
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,261
Come here...

1212
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,460
A few of my shirts and trousers
are lying outside the cupboard,

1213
00:58:02,603 --> 00:58:05,766
take them to the washerwoman
and get them ironed nicely.

1214
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:09,309
And don't come back till they're
all done, even if takes an hour.

1215
00:58:09,377 --> 00:58:10,537
But Shah Rukh's film on TV...

1216
00:58:10,645 --> 00:58:12,203
Hey, don't talk nonsense with me...

1217
00:58:12,313 --> 00:58:15,043
till the job is not done,
stay with the washerwoman.

1218
00:58:17,985 --> 00:58:20,419
What can I say...
I'm missing the film...

1219
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:22,352
There's always so
much work around here...

1220
00:58:22,423 --> 00:58:24,823
Have you seen it?
- Not yet, I'm not that lucky...

1221
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:26,951
Oh, you haven't?

1222
00:58:27,061 --> 00:58:29,188
I'm crazy about Shah Rukh...

1223
00:58:29,263 --> 00:58:30,753
But ever since papaji has retired,

1224
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:32,561
he just doesn't let
go off the remote control...

1225
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:34,765
Bloody duffer!

1226
00:58:35,436 --> 00:58:36,403
Hey

1227
00:58:36,504 --> 00:58:38,597
Hey lovebirds!

1228
00:58:38,773 --> 00:58:39,865
Hi
- Hi

1229
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,498
Are we the love-birds
or are you guys the love-birds?

1230
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:43,338
lmmy's record-breaking
relationship...

1231
00:58:43,444 --> 00:58:45,469
Two months and still
going strong, yes?

1232
00:58:45,847 --> 00:58:47,246
Yes...

1233
00:58:47,381 --> 00:58:50,214
Just when Mohit lost his job,
Swati came into my life...

1234
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,878
What? Now everything will
be with reference to my job?

1235
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,455
Before Mohit's job...
After Mohit's job?

1236
00:58:55,723 --> 00:58:58,283
Bad mood huh?
Come on show us your dimples man...

1237
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:00,051
C'mon show us...

1238
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:02,958
Hmmm...very bad mood.

1239
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:06,962
Immy let's go dance!

1240
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:10,930
One Long Island ice
tea and one rum-n-coke.

1241
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,336
No rum-n-coke.

1242
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,130
Yes rum-n-coke.

1243
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:15,707
I'm on antibiotics....

1244
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,140
Do you have the flu?

1245
00:59:17,311 --> 00:59:19,108
Best medicine, Rum n Coke!

1246
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,442
One Rum n Coke please.

1247
00:59:20,514 --> 00:59:22,311
Sir, if my girlfriend
would tell me so lovingly...

1248
00:59:22,383 --> 00:59:23,407
What would you do huh?

1249
00:59:23,517 --> 00:59:25,041
Shower in Rum and Coke?

1250
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,617
Go, shower...

1251
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,680
You just...make your drinks...

1252
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:35,421
Mohit... I'm paying...

1253
00:59:35,496 --> 00:59:37,930
Why do you keep ranting
about paying all the time?

1254
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:39,728
I don't want it, that's it!

1255
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:41,131
Is there some compulsion?

1256
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:49,109
Ok, no compulsions...sorry.

1257
00:59:58,252 --> 00:59:59,549
I am sorry.

1258
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,515
Hey

1259
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,456
I am sorry dude!

1260
01:00:06,961 --> 01:00:08,952
Hey listen...we both are going
for the rock show on 25th, ok?

1261
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,554
But aren't the tickets for Rs 5000?
- No if's and but's...

1262
01:00:11,632 --> 01:00:14,362
I'll pay right now, you can return
the money when you find a job!

1263
01:00:14,435 --> 01:00:16,403
By then I'll be a bus conductor...

1264
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:17,698
Better if you take someone else.

1265
01:00:17,872 --> 01:00:19,999
If you'll be a bus conductor,
then I'll become the bus driver.

1266
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,100
And I'll kidnap you
and your bus forever.

1267
01:00:23,344 --> 01:00:26,211
And what if I become
an ice-cream seller?

1268
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:27,981
Then I'll buy the van...

1269
01:00:28,049 --> 01:00:30,916
And I'll gobble up
all the ice-cream, and you!

1270
01:00:31,118 --> 01:00:32,483
Look, it's my job to gobble up...

1271
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:34,751
And what if I end up as
an auto-rickshaw driver?

1272
01:00:35,456 --> 01:00:36,616
Then I'll be the traffic cop...

1273
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:40,583
I'll cut you a ticket
and lock you up in my jail for life.

1274
01:00:41,228 --> 01:00:44,459
Ok...And what if I land up
being a postman?

1275
01:00:44,865 --> 01:00:52,101
Need;ess;y, you make and break.

1276
01:00:52,173 --> 01:01:00,842
Need;ess;y, you count each penny.

1277
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:10,785
Need;ess;y you're afraid of ;ove.

01:01:11,158 --> 01:01:21,966

Need;ess;y, you make and break.

1280
01:01:33,714 --> 01:01:36,308
Need;ess;y, you count each penny.

Need;ess;y you're afraid of ;ove.

01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:41,780
Need;ess;y you push me honey.

;'m the heroine of your every story.

1284
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:47,524
;'m the happy ending
of your every ta;e.

1285
01:01:52,299 --> 01:01:53,789
When the storm came,

1286
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:55,130
You packed up your things,

1287
01:01:55,202 --> 01:01:57,466
You emptied my heart and ;eft.

1288
01:01:57,538 --> 01:01:59,005

You wou;d throw me out instead.

Hey, ; made a promise for ;ife,

But my pockets are empty,

To co;or yourse;f in another hue.

1312
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:23,116
Not easy to do.

1313

Co;ors fade,

1314
01:03:25,526 --> 01:03:28,359

Wow so many jobs?

Yes, but around 80% are useless...

1344
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:04,985
What is this now?

1345
01:05:05,092 --> 01:05:06,616
It's a game... just...

01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:08,324

You come here every

1356
01:05:35,789 --> 01:05:37,086
the pretext of
a client meeting, right

1357
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:38,681
Ok then, I won't come from tomorrow.

1358
01:05:38,759 --> 01:05:40,886
No no...I was just asking...

1359
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:43,828
My job shouldn't create
problems for your job.

1360
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:45,526
My job...

1361
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:47,798
Nothing will happen. Don't worry.

1362
01:05:49,837 --> 01:05:51,304
Radha!

1363
01:05:52,206 --> 01:05:54,003
Come on, come on and take your coat.

1364
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:56,502
Coming, coming...have patience!

1365
01:05:57,678 --> 01:05:59,270
What took you so long papaji...

1366
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,574
What were you doing?

1367
01:06:02,149 --> 01:06:03,844
We are an insurance
company Mr. Chaddha,

1368
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:06,249
and your experience
is in airlines marketing.

1369

Won't work for us.

1370
01:06:07,554 --> 01:06:09,954
Sir just give me a chance.

1371
01:06:10,224 --> 01:06:12,522
Not just insurance,
I can even market the Qutub Minar!

01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,753
Qutub Minar!?

1373
01:06:13,861 --> 01:06:15,488
It's not that easy Mr. Chaddha...

1374
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,086
It's the era of specialization...

1375
01:06:17,164 --> 01:06:18,188
Thank you for coming.

1376
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:20,824

1386
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:38,713

a job are you begging?

1387
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,258
Please!

1388
01:06:47,361 --> 01:06:48,191
I am sorry ...

1389
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:54,124
Hey listen...
Only six tickets are left...

1390
01:06:54,234 --> 01:06:55,633
Should I book tickets
for both you and Mohit?

1391
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,698
Yeah, book them!
- No listen, this is red lounge...

1392
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,171
You guys ditched us the last time...

1393
01:07:00,274 --> 01:07:01,832
700 rupees were wasted...

1394
01:07:02,076 --> 01:07:03,634
Please confirm and tell us Mayera...

1395
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,351
Excuse me ... your phone ...

1396
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:22,285
Hey
- Hi baby..

1397
01:07:22,463 --> 01:07:24,488
Six thirty movie...
- I can't come...

1398
01:07:24,698 --> 01:07:26,529
Why, what are you doing?

1399
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:29,325
Everyone is going, let's go?

1400
01:07:29,436 --> 01:07:31,904
Everyone is so worried
about my job...

1401
01:07:32,373 --> 01:07:34,170
That's the reason why
I've come for this interview,

1402
01:07:34,241 --> 01:07:35,538
to end everyone's worries.

1403
01:07:35,642 --> 01:07:38,406
So I should avoid watching
the movie with everyone

1404
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,139
and focus on my interview.

1405
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:43,581
I'm sure everyone will understand.

1406
01:07:44,385 --> 01:07:45,716
Mohit, these are your friends.

1407
01:07:45,786 --> 01:07:46,980
That's why they're
so worried about you.

1408
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:49,086
There's no need to be so sarcastic.

1409
01:07:53,227 --> 01:07:56,594
Anyway, no chance for
the six thirty show right?

1410
01:07:57,631 --> 01:07:58,529
No chance...

1411
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,360
There are around 10-11
candidates before me

1412
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:03,129
The interviews are extensive,
in-depth.

1413
01:08:03,203 --> 01:08:04,636
But in case it gets over earlier...

1414
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,104
Damn it! I said there's no chance

1415
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,905
Ok...best of luck.

1416
01:08:49,116 --> 01:08:50,481
Hi.. brother
- Hi.

1417
01:08:50,551 --> 01:08:52,576
Sister is in her room.
- Ok.

1418
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:00,592
Mohit! Mohit..

1419
01:09:02,196 --> 01:09:02,958
Hello

1420
01:09:03,864 --> 01:09:07,732
Hey did you email
my application properly?

1421
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:08,790
There's no reply from anyone!

1422
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:10,200
Why are you getting stressed?
You'll get a response soon.

1423
01:09:10,304 --> 01:09:12,363
Hey, where are you going man?
- It's her birthday.

1424
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,333
Assault mission game...cool huh?

1425
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:16,841
Where did you get this from?

1426
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,411
Palika market. Six hundred.

1427
01:09:18,579 --> 01:09:20,444
If you'd told me, my guy
would've got it for three fifty

1428
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:23,675
Your guy wouldn't even
get the cover for three fifty.

1429
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,615
I have a reliable source in Palika.

1430
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:27,744
Mohit?!
- Ya Coming!

1431
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:29,244
Coming!

1432
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:33,758
Hi

1433
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,658
Happy birthday.
- Thank you...

1434
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:42,995
How do I look?

1435
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:45,431
Very hot...shall I gobble you up?

1436
01:09:49,376 --> 01:09:52,072
Mango! My birthday gift to myself.

1437
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:54,144
What did you get for me?

1438
01:10:19,273 --> 01:10:20,262
That's it?

1439
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:24,171
How could I borrow money from you,
to get a gift for you?

1440
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:27,410
It's my birthday!

1441
01:10:27,814 --> 01:10:29,509
I wasn't expecting
a diamond necklace,

1442
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,247
you could have got me just a rose...

1443
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,315
You get pocket money after all.

1444
01:10:36,924 --> 01:10:39,654
Open the door,
or else we'll break it down!

1445
01:10:43,397 --> 01:10:48,096
Happy Birthday to you...

1446
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:51,269
Hi Wassup! Hey!

1447
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:53,169
Open the gift ya...

1448
01:10:55,475 --> 01:10:56,840
Amazing!

1449
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,639
Guys c'mon ya!

1450
01:10:59,012 --> 01:11:00,411
Go for it!

1451
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,845
Open the gift ya...

1452
01:11:04,918 --> 01:11:07,182
It's awesome
Go get the candles!

1453
01:11:08,589 --> 01:11:09,715
Go get it!

1454
01:11:16,196 --> 01:11:18,687
Your cheque...it's bounced again.

1455
01:11:19,299 --> 01:11:20,857
The landlord's fuming dude.

1456
01:11:21,234 --> 01:11:23,259
You've got to arrange
for the rent today somehow.

1457
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:24,697
Bro you help me out today.

1458
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,266
I'll arrange the money by next week.

1459
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,135
Dude you haven't returned
the last loan either.

1460
01:11:29,009 --> 01:11:31,637
I need cash badly,
please return my cash as well.

1461
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,070
You know what, forget it...

1462
01:11:35,148 --> 01:11:37,275
just arrange for this month's rent.

1463
01:11:38,418 --> 01:11:41,080
And Mohit, bro,
do something about your job.

1464
01:11:41,688 --> 01:11:43,519
I'm working on it, I am.

1465
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,579
What are you doing?

1466
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,090
You're just busy
flying high in the air!

1467
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,322
Come back to earth bro,
accept a job in a lower position.

1468
01:11:49,396 --> 01:11:50,488
Why should I?

1469
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,866
I'm an MBA for God's sake,
top of my class.

1470
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:55,557
And who got promoted, you or me?

1471
01:11:55,669 --> 01:11:58,399
I was, and because of that
promotion your job got saved.

1472
01:11:58,472 --> 01:12:00,997
So in return I should pay
your rent for the rest of my life?

1473
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:01,902
lmmy

1474
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:03,401
Get out!

1475
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:10,772
You know what...you've started
enjoying being unemployed.

1476
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:13,046
You want your money?
You'll get it...

1477
01:12:13,387 --> 01:12:14,684
Now just get lost!

1478
01:12:17,357 --> 01:12:18,881
I don't have fifteen thousand.

1479
01:12:18,992 --> 01:12:20,755
I spent a lot this month...

1480
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,823
I got a new dress,
my birthday party,

1481
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,522
your car EMI,

1482
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:26,724
your credit card bill,

1483
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,529
your phone bill,
your pocket money...

1484
01:12:28,602 --> 01:12:29,500
Awesome!

1485
01:12:29,836 --> 01:12:31,030
Means whenever
I ask you for money,

1486
01:12:31,104 --> 01:12:32,628
I'll have to listen
to this entire list?

1487
01:12:32,706 --> 01:12:35,072
If you had warned me
about the rent in advance,

1488
01:12:35,175 --> 01:12:36,301
I wouldn't have bought
the rock show tickets.

1489
01:12:36,376 --> 01:12:37,343
Rock show tickets!

1490
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,303
Did I ask you to buy those tickets?

1491
01:12:42,082 --> 01:12:44,107
Mohit now don't do that...
- You don't do that ...

1492
01:12:47,954 --> 01:12:48,921
If you had told me earlier,

1493
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,547
I'd have sacrificed this as well...
like all other things.

1494
01:12:50,624 --> 01:12:53,252
Sacrifice! What a sacrifice!

1495
01:12:53,326 --> 01:12:55,692
- Yes ... sacrifice!

1496
01:12:55,762 --> 01:12:56,751
You don't realize anything...

1497
01:12:56,863 --> 01:12:58,763
I haven't even bought a new pair
of sandals these last two months.

1498
01:12:58,865 --> 01:13:00,730
O god ... What a crisis!!!
What a crisis!!

1499
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:03,166
Yes it is a crisis ...

1500
01:13:03,236 --> 01:13:04,897
Stuck on pizzas
and your oily omelet's..

1501
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:06,768
I've gained two bloody kilos!

1502
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,206
I work hard so that
I can enjoy my life,

1503
01:13:09,309 --> 01:13:10,333
but thanks to you,

1504
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,570
leave alone malls and night-clubs,

1505
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:13,976
I've even forgotten the
smell of multiplex pop-corn!

1506
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:16,515
I don't want to waste my life
sitting in front of your television!

1507
01:13:16,616 --> 01:13:18,447
It's one rock show that I wanted
to go for and even for that...

1508
01:13:18,552 --> 01:13:19,610
you're creating such a scene!

1509
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:22,621
Mayera, one rock show!
It's just a rock show!

1510
01:13:22,723 --> 01:13:24,782
You know what,
you should be given a Nobel Prize!

1511
01:13:24,891 --> 01:13:26,791
Somebody, please,
give her a Nobel Prize.

1512
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,021
Any half sensible man would've
actually given me a prize!

1513
01:13:29,129 --> 01:13:30,892
Why prize,
I'll give you your money back.

1514
01:13:30,964 --> 01:13:32,932
Don't stress,
I'll settle everything!

1515
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:35,697
Ok Mohit every single penny...

1516
01:13:35,769 --> 01:13:38,636
Of course! With interest!
- You are so disgusting ...

1517
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:40,570
Yes, I'm the disgusting one.
You're Mother India!

1518
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,005
Mohit stop the car ...

1519
01:13:44,745 --> 01:13:45,643
I said I'll return it.

1520
01:13:45,746 --> 01:13:48,112
I don't want to sit
in your dirty rotten car!

1521
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:49,239
Stop the car!

1522
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,342
Ok..

1523
01:13:52,085 --> 01:13:53,916
Out of my car now...

1524
01:13:53,987 --> 01:13:56,854
Get lost, bye...
and never sit in it again!

1525
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,125
Moron!

1526
01:14:06,266 --> 01:14:07,528
Where to madam?

1527
01:14:07,601 --> 01:14:08,533
What do you want? Move ahead!

1528
01:14:10,604 --> 01:14:13,164
Hey rickshaw...rickshaw.

1529
01:14:13,373 --> 01:14:17,173
One two three four...
One two three four

1530
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,736
One two three four...
One two three four

1531
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:22,508
One two...

1532
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,814
I've got mail...

1533
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:31,757
there is a vacancy...
I would like to welcome...

1534
01:14:31,825 --> 01:14:33,452
join company.

1535
01:14:34,227 --> 01:14:37,492
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oye yes yes!

1536
01:14:40,433 --> 01:14:42,367
Sir, it's a car not a cycle...

1537
01:14:42,435 --> 01:14:43,663
Latest model.

1538
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,933
No dent, no scratch,
hasn't run even a thousand miles.

1539
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,668
Your quotation is a shame for me...

1540
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:53,368
Make an offer I can't refuse...

1541
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,674
The car is in your garage...

1542
01:14:54,748 --> 01:14:56,579
as soon as the money is
in sir's pocket!

1543
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,741
...Or else I can go to Mr. Bhalla.

1544
01:14:59,085 --> 01:15:00,814
Yes Sir
- Yes Mohit...

1545
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:02,878
I've called to inform you,

1546
01:15:03,323 --> 01:15:06,190
an interview call has finally come.

1547
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:09,387
It had to...the application
was filed so neatly.

1548
01:15:09,462 --> 01:15:11,157
Neatly means nothing...

1549
01:15:11,264 --> 01:15:15,291
My five page, mind-blowing
bio-data must have impressed them.

1550
01:15:15,535 --> 01:15:16,968
Anyway, reach home quickly.

1551
01:15:17,037 --> 01:15:18,436
We have to start preparing
for the interview.

1552
01:15:18,538 --> 01:15:20,335
No Sir, not now...
there's some crisis here...

1553
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:24,036
Ok... if you can't come,
I'll come to your office..

1554
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:24,974
No no...

1555
01:15:25,545 --> 01:15:27,308
You don't come here.
I'll do something

1556
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,371
Good, reach by 5.

1557
01:15:29,616 --> 01:15:33,643
And look...thank you for all.

1558
01:15:34,521 --> 01:15:35,783
Ok then.

1559
01:15:38,258 --> 01:15:38,986
Yes papa...

1560
01:15:39,059 --> 01:15:41,493
Mayera come home early today...

1561
01:15:41,595 --> 01:15:44,223
Look, have I ever asked
you to come home early?

1562
01:15:44,297 --> 01:15:45,093
No, right!

1563
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:47,599
But today please reach home by 6,
and no discussion on this.

1564
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:49,396
Or I will never speak to you again.

1565
01:15:49,469 --> 01:15:51,266
Six means six. Bye bye bye.

1566
01:15:51,738 --> 01:15:52,670
Radha!

1567
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:54,502
O radha
- Yes papaji

1568
01:15:54,574 --> 01:15:57,168
Order two chicken
from the meat shop...

1569
01:15:57,277 --> 01:15:59,438
and prepare the biryani spices....

1570
01:15:59,546 --> 01:16:01,207
Mohit and Mayera
are coming home for dinner...

1571
01:16:01,314 --> 01:16:02,906
Alright!
- And listen, make halwa as well.

1572
01:16:02,983 --> 01:16:05,918
Gursharan...You know
PC Jewelers right?

1573
01:16:06,453 --> 01:16:07,818
Can you get me a discount?

1574
01:16:08,288 --> 01:16:09,687
So meet me there!

1575
01:16:09,756 --> 01:16:11,121
At the South Ex show room...

1576
01:16:11,224 --> 01:16:12,213
in one hour...

1577
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:17,924
I'll call you back.

1578
01:16:22,335 --> 01:16:23,529
Eighty eight thousand...

1579
01:16:24,304 --> 01:16:25,771
with detailed accounts, date-wise.

1580
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,863
I've put in five thousand extra,
just in case I've made a mistake.

1581
01:16:28,575 --> 01:16:30,770
And if the mistake is of more
than five thousand, just email.

1582
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:31,935
I'll you a draft.

1583
01:16:35,315 --> 01:16:37,340
Where is the damn accounts slip?

1584
01:16:37,717 --> 01:16:38,615
It's ok...

1585
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,345
I'll make a fresh one...

1586
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:41,910
I remember everything...

1587
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:56,130
What impression will
my son-in-law have of me,

1588
01:16:56,202 --> 01:16:57,635
if I give him such a ring?

1589
01:16:58,371 --> 01:17:01,363
Show me a solid one,
not these flimsy things.

1590
01:17:01,474 --> 01:17:02,634
What are you doing madam,

1591
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:05,109
Sehgal Sir is secretary
to Government of India IAS...

1592
01:17:05,178 --> 01:17:06,509
Show us something
worthy of his status.

1593
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:07,944
Where is your owner, call him...

1594
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:09,481
No no Sir, I'll show you...

1595
01:17:09,549 --> 01:17:10,641
Take a look at this...

1596
01:17:12,485 --> 01:17:15,181
Matching rings for
the bride and groom.

1597
01:17:15,288 --> 01:17:17,085
Yes, yes these are
solo diamonds right...

1598
01:17:17,157 --> 01:17:18,488
What are they called?
- Sir solitaire..

1599
01:17:18,558 --> 01:17:20,492
Solitaire. solitaire.
They are good.

1600
01:17:20,593 --> 01:17:24,290
This will cost you around
four and a half lakhs...

1601
01:17:25,832 --> 01:17:26,662
No...

1602
01:17:26,766 --> 01:17:28,757
Four and a half is too much...
Show us something reasonable.

1603
01:17:28,835 --> 01:17:30,769
No, do one thing...
please pack these.

1604
01:17:31,871 --> 01:17:32,735
Here!

1605
01:17:34,474 --> 01:17:35,463
Please check...

1606
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:38,010
this includes the tickets
of your stupid rock show...

1607
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:42,312
So I guess everything
is cleared between us.

1608
01:17:43,249 --> 01:17:44,341
All clear...

1609
01:17:44,784 --> 01:17:46,547
Rock show is stupid
because I wanted to go...

1610
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:49,349
and to be a cry baby like
you and stay home is very clever.

1611
01:17:50,056 --> 01:17:52,616
I don't want to be clever like you,
I'm fine being stupid.

1612
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:54,419
And you know what,

1613
01:17:54,627 --> 01:17:56,390
clever and stupid
shouldn't get married either.

1614
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:03,231
Yes, as if I want to get married.

1615
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:04,201
In any case I can't afford

1616
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:07,171
the stupidity of love
and marriage anymore.

1617
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,105
You know Gursharan
- Yes sir!

1618
01:18:09,242 --> 01:18:10,971
This boy that Mayera has chosen...

1619
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:14,371
His market value may be less,
but his character is priceless...

1620
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,109
In my humble opinion,
character is the only value sir.

1621
01:18:17,183 --> 01:18:19,276
Today when I got the interview mail,

1622
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,920
I thought I've tested
this boy enough...

1623
01:18:22,188 --> 01:18:23,280
I should agree to their marriage...

1624
01:18:23,356 --> 01:18:24,755
Correct thinking sir.

1625
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:29,093
But Mohit should never
know I was praising him,

1626
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:31,357
how long does it take
to get conceited, huh?

1627
01:18:31,431 --> 01:18:32,864
Top secret sir.

1628
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,627
Now even this expensive
ring seems reasonable for him...

1629
01:18:37,871 --> 01:18:39,498
perfect matching.

1630
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,702
We are not made for each other.

1631
01:18:41,808 --> 01:18:42,866
Tsck!

1632
01:18:44,144 --> 01:18:46,704
Actually there isn't any
point in meeting again.

1633
01:18:46,813 --> 01:18:49,304
So I've not come to meet you,
I've just come to return the money.

1634
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:51,981
Break-up.

1635
01:19:01,594 --> 01:19:03,687
In fact I was going to say it first.

1636
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,957
Breakup!
- Fine,

1637
01:19:06,332 --> 01:19:08,664
you're first, I'm last...happy?

1638
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:19,378
Fine then get lost.

1639
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:20,707
You get lost

1640
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:23,140
This is my office Mohit,
you get lost...

1641
01:19:23,249 --> 01:19:26,218
Your office, your money...
go to hell Mayera.

1642
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:31,650
Why do a;; answers,

1643
01:19:31,758 --> 01:19:34,989
Seem unre;iab;e.

1644
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:41,393
Nothing seems rea;,

1645
01:19:41,601 --> 01:19:45,799
On these crossroads

1646
01:19:48,108 --> 01:19:52,010
Except an imaginary indifference.

1647
01:19:55,115 --> 01:19:59,108
Except an imaginary indifference.

1648
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:06,758
Except an imaginary indifference.

1649
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,065
This is the entire
history of the company...

1650
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:25,405
Please put away the
games and try to read it.

1651
01:20:25,645 --> 01:20:27,408
Why should I read about them,

1652
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:30,208
are they taking my interview
or am I taking theirs?

1653
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:32,881
When I had come to
ask for Mayera's hand,

1654
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,609
I had done my complete
home-work on you...

1655
01:20:34,854 --> 01:20:37,448
so that I don't say anything
that will make you reject me.

1656
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:40,557
Wow! You're very cool...

1657
01:20:41,828 --> 01:20:44,524
Ok, I'm leaving now
- Wait, wait...

1658
01:20:45,365 --> 01:20:47,162
I'll get you a beer...
- No Sir, I have to go to work...

1659
01:20:47,267 --> 01:20:49,701
Beer is just a cold drink

1660
01:20:49,802 --> 01:20:51,827
Please don't have a cold drink
before your interview.

1661
01:20:51,938 --> 01:20:53,462
Ok, do one thing..
you load the game,

1662
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,030
I'll just come. Load the game...

1663
01:20:56,743 --> 01:20:58,643
Now where's this Mayera?

1664
01:20:58,711 --> 01:21:00,576
Must be on her way...
- It's six...

1665
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,443
I had told her to come early...

1666
01:21:03,183 --> 01:21:04,775
How much longer can I delay Mohit...

1667
01:21:04,884 --> 01:21:07,375
Aah...The smell of the
halwa is irresistible...

1668
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:08,852
The thing is son,

1669
01:21:08,955 --> 01:21:11,423
this is not a chilled beer,
it's a child beer...

1670
01:21:11,891 --> 01:21:13,688
Cheers!
- Papa I am home ...

1671
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,152
We're here Mayera...

1672
01:21:17,397 --> 01:21:18,955
Where are you off to?

1673
01:21:19,465 --> 01:21:20,625
Mohit?!!!

1674
01:21:23,002 --> 01:21:24,196
What the hell ...

1675
01:21:24,537 --> 01:21:25,731
What are you doing in my house?

1676
01:21:26,773 --> 01:21:29,537
I...l...
- Hey, son of Romeo...

1677
01:21:29,609 --> 01:21:32,100
your Juliet is here...
Leave the window and come in...

1678
01:21:32,212 --> 01:21:34,009
Papa please...
- Shhh...quiet....nobody will speak,

1679
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,638
Only I will speak now...

1680
01:21:35,715 --> 01:21:37,512
Radha!
- Radha is at home?

1681
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:38,744
So where else will she be?

1682
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:43,584
C'mon Mohit, show some enthusiasm...

1683
01:21:44,757 --> 01:21:47,317
Sit down both of you!

1684
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:48,820
Congratulations brother...

1685
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:51,163
Sister...

1686
01:21:54,968 --> 01:22:00,497
Yoohoo...Surprise...
Congratulations...

1687
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:03,573
One for you and one for you

1688
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:06,774
Take it, will you keep
me standing like this?

1689
01:22:08,481 --> 01:22:13,885
Tell me, do you like it?
How do you like it, the rings?

1690
01:22:15,188 --> 01:22:16,246
What?

1691
01:22:18,858 --> 01:22:20,917
Someone say something...

1692
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:24,860
This is your probation's
report card...

1693
01:22:25,031 --> 01:22:27,363
you're not perfect,
but we'll make do...

1694
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:31,633
Now before I change my mind,

1695
01:22:31,704 --> 01:22:34,172
please make each other
wear the rings...

1696
01:22:41,547 --> 01:22:42,445
What's wrong?

1697
01:22:42,949 --> 01:22:44,974
They're solitaires...

1698
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:47,108
Don't like the design?

1699
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,611
Ok, just wear them
now for ceremony...

1700
01:22:49,722 --> 01:22:51,690
Tomorrow you can go there
and choose your own rings.

1701
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:52,450
Ok?

1702
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:55,556
So who wears the ring first,
the boy or the girl?

1703
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,397
Why are you laughing?

1704
01:22:59,532 --> 01:23:00,931
Papa...we are not getting married...

1705
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,162
She is serious ...

1706
01:23:05,838 --> 01:23:08,864
It's over between us...all over..

1707
01:23:10,343 --> 01:23:13,176
Hey...sit, sit down!

1708
01:23:15,848 --> 01:23:18,942
So I simply played all this squash,
wasted my sweat,

1709
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:21,310
made enquiries in
fifty departments...

1710
01:23:23,356 --> 01:23:26,018
And do you know how many
phone calls, photocopies,

1711
01:23:26,092 --> 01:23:29,357
plastic files I've spent
on...on this Mohit of your's?

1712
01:23:30,496 --> 01:23:31,554
Not mine.

1713
01:23:32,332 --> 01:23:35,426
Now I'm not going to
investigate any other boy...

1714
01:23:36,002 --> 01:23:39,438
Talk to each other, and resolve
whatever this fight is about...

1715
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:42,233
Say sorry,
and exchange rings...come on...

1716
01:23:42,342 --> 01:23:43,468
Papa it's impossible.

1717
01:23:43,543 --> 01:23:44,942
There's a huge gap between us now.

1718
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:46,876
Which can only be filled
with a lot of money.

1719
01:23:46,946 --> 01:23:48,937
Money that your daughter has,
but I don't...

1720
01:23:49,716 --> 01:23:51,877
Does anyone fight over money...

1721
01:23:53,286 --> 01:23:55,618
Did you borrow money from him?
Return it...

1722
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:58,783
I don't have any money
for her to borrow...

1723
01:23:58,891 --> 01:24:00,984
I haven't got a salary
for three months...

1724
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:04,721
and the fact is, I am unemployed..

1725
01:24:05,565 --> 01:24:06,554
I'm looking for a job.

1726
01:24:06,733 --> 01:24:09,395
You lost your airlines job?

1727
01:24:10,803 --> 01:24:11,963
Oh bloody!

1728
01:24:13,005 --> 01:24:14,131
You lost it then itself, right?

1729
01:24:14,207 --> 01:24:16,437
I knew it...I knew it...

1730
01:24:16,609 --> 01:24:18,076
You lied to me?
- Yes...

1731
01:24:18,544 --> 01:24:19,670
I lied to you...

1732
01:24:19,946 --> 01:24:21,709
So now, should I
make her wear the ring?

1733
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:22,975
Like hell you will!

1734
01:24:23,049 --> 01:24:25,017
You've failed a 100%...
100% fail!

1735
01:24:25,118 --> 01:24:26,244
You've lied, you liar!

1736
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:27,785
And you pretend to be Gandhi...

1737
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:29,286
you are lying to Mayera yourself...

1738
01:24:29,989 --> 01:24:30,887
What lying?

1739
01:24:31,324 --> 01:24:34,259
I'm trying for a job,
he's helping me...

1740
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,089
Was helping me...was!

1741
01:24:37,296 --> 01:24:38,957
You had promised me...

1742
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,109
Sister, halwa...

1743
01:24:54,947 --> 01:24:56,141
Forget it Papa ...

1744
01:24:56,215 --> 01:24:58,308
Please get rid of
this job mania...ok?

1745
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:01,152
Mohit gone... mania gone!

1746
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:25,477
Driver, bring the car...
- Excuse me sir...

1747
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:26,738
Come in Mayera.

1748
01:25:26,846 --> 01:25:29,542
Sir is the Dubai
position still open?

1749
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:31,313
You've taken too long silly...

1750
01:25:31,617 --> 01:25:33,209
Dubai office has
already got someone.

1751
01:25:33,286 --> 01:25:35,277
Trust me I don't
like that moron one bit.

1752
01:25:35,488 --> 01:25:36,955
I wanted you there Mayera.

1753
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:41,919
But he's joining next week,
if you can go before that...

1754
01:25:41,994 --> 01:25:43,325
Can you leave tonight?

1755
01:25:43,563 --> 01:25:45,724
The travel desk will
arrange the visa..

1756
01:25:45,832 --> 01:25:47,766
Absolutely sir
- Perfect!

1757
01:25:47,834 --> 01:25:50,530
I say go there, work for a week ...
do your magic ...

1758
01:25:50,636 --> 01:25:52,297
If you are able
to convince them there,

1759
01:25:52,405 --> 01:25:53,667
I'll get all the approvals here.

1760
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,673
And once you get
the appointment in Dubai,

1761
01:25:55,975 --> 01:25:57,909
come back over
the weekend to shift base properly.

1762
01:25:57,977 --> 01:25:58,807
What say?

1763
01:25:59,111 --> 01:26:01,443
I say ... Thank you ...
thank you so much sir.

1764
01:26:01,514 --> 01:26:03,209
But for now,
just keep this to yourself...

1765
01:26:03,282 --> 01:26:04,943
you are going on
a regular assignment.

1766
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:09,815
What about Mohit?

1767
01:26:12,191 --> 01:26:13,317
Mohit is history.

1768
01:26:35,781 --> 01:26:36,839
What's going on?

1769
01:26:39,285 --> 01:26:42,015
Hello sir...l'm Nawab Master...
the driving instructor...

1770
01:26:42,288 --> 01:26:44,051
I have a second hand
business as well...

1771
01:26:44,156 --> 01:26:47,592
just yesterday I sold
Mohit sir's car at a top price...

1772
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,457
Call me if you have anything.

1773
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,323
Mohit?! Dude You sold your car!

1774
01:26:51,397 --> 01:26:52,421
What's going on!?

1775
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:56,998
Ok so all accounts
have been settled now...

1776
01:26:57,069 --> 01:26:57,967
Where are you going?

1777
01:26:58,037 --> 01:27:00,699
They're settled today,
they'll be unsettled tomorrow...

1778
01:27:01,474 --> 01:27:02,600
If I stay with you guys
any longer who knows,

1779
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:04,005
I might begin to enjoy
being unemployed...

1780
01:27:04,477 --> 01:27:06,638
Mohit ... Mohit sorry.

1781
01:27:06,712 --> 01:27:08,646
I swear I'll never
read your newspaper...

1782
01:27:08,714 --> 01:27:09,942
I'll never watch Big Boss...

1783
01:27:10,049 --> 01:27:11,983
I'll pay for beer for
the entire month...I swear...

1784
01:27:12,084 --> 01:27:13,642
You can have my entire
Playboy collection!

1785
01:27:13,719 --> 01:27:15,016
The remote as well!

1786
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:17,519
Mohit...

1787
01:27:43,482 --> 01:27:45,541
You coach your heart,

1788
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:47,676
Reproach your heart,

1789
01:27:47,753 --> 01:27:51,814
Foo; it into submission.

1790
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:53,984
;f it's not broken,

1791
01:27:54,093 --> 01:27:56,118
;t's trust is not taken,

1792
01:27:56,195 --> 01:28:00,131
Then why does it hurt so much...

1793
01:28:00,466 --> 01:28:02,593
Fa;se concessions...

1794
01:28:02,668 --> 01:28:04,659
Fake confessions...

1795
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:08,103
;t hides a;; your mistakes...

1796
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:11,035
;t foo;s others,

1797
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:13,135
And condemns itse;f,

1798
01:28:13,212 --> 01:28:17,808
Looks for gain even in ;osses.

1799
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:23,484
Stupidities...

1800
01:28:23,723 --> 01:28:25,748
Meaning;ess and point;ess ...

1801
01:28:25,858 --> 01:28:27,849
Need;ess and thought;ess...

1802
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,225
Unnecessary stupidities...

1803
01:28:31,297 --> 01:28:36,234
Stupidities...

1804
01:28:36,335 --> 01:28:38,394
Meaning;ess and point;ess ...

1805
01:28:38,471 --> 01:28:40,496
Need;ess and thought;ess...

1806
01:28:40,606 --> 01:28:45,043
Unnecessary stupidities...

1807
01:28:52,818 --> 01:28:54,615
Mr. Chaddha
- Yes...

1808
01:28:55,021 --> 01:28:56,488
Hi Mr. Chaddha
- Hello.

1809
01:28:56,589 --> 01:28:57,613
I'm really sorry ...

1810
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,214
All the positions have been taken...

1811
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,189
Why don't you leave
your resume behind,

1812
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,249
we'll get back to you.

1813
01:29:02,995 --> 01:29:04,986
No... thanks

1814
01:29:05,064 --> 01:29:06,258
Ok...all the best.

1815
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,767
Your temper's sti;; high,

1816
01:29:16,842 --> 01:29:18,810
You show no improvement.

1817
01:29:18,878 --> 01:29:23,008
You fa;; on your face a;; a;ong.

1818
01:29:23,115 --> 01:29:25,083
Not a;; is f;awed,

1819
01:29:25,184 --> 01:29:27,175
Not a;; is ;ost,

1820
01:29:27,286 --> 01:29:31,689
Then why is your face so ;ong?

1821
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:35,887
You spend your days cursing others..

1822
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:40,125
Oh how stubborn you are!

1823
01:29:40,232 --> 01:29:44,293
Someone must stop you,
at ;east accost you

1824
01:29:44,403 --> 01:29:48,305
Ti;; when wi;; you foo; yourse;f?

1825
01:29:48,407 --> 01:29:50,238
Mohit, hi.
- Hi.

1826
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:52,708
Meet Mohit ...
Our new counter manager ...

1827
01:29:52,812 --> 01:29:53,710
Hello sir

1828
01:29:54,246 --> 01:29:55,406
How are you doing?
- Hello

1829
01:29:55,481 --> 01:29:57,506
Hi there
- Welcome

1830
01:29:59,518 --> 01:30:01,486
Meaning;ess and point;ess ...

1831
01:30:01,554 --> 01:30:03,681
Need;ess and thought;ess...

1832
01:30:03,756 --> 01:30:06,350
Unnecessary stupidities...

1833
01:30:06,425 --> 01:30:08,620
Very hot...
shall I just gobble you up?

1834
01:30:08,728 --> 01:30:10,821
Stupidities...

1835
01:30:12,131 --> 01:30:14,190
Meaning;ess and point;ess ...

1836
01:30:14,266 --> 01:30:16,291
Need;ess and thought;ess...

1837
01:30:16,402 --> 01:30:19,838
Unnecessary stupidities...

1838
01:30:56,375 --> 01:31:00,539
Hey you foo;, its easy

1839
01:31:00,613 --> 01:31:04,777
To join these broken parts...

1840
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:08,946
Don't fret, its not hard

1841
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:13,150
To say you're sorry at ;ast.

1842
01:31:13,225 --> 01:31:15,284
Why are you faking,

1843
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:17,352
Posturing and raving,

1844
01:31:17,463 --> 01:31:21,456
What wi;; you achieve from it?

1845
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,694
Why open accounts...

1846
01:31:23,803 --> 01:31:25,794
Why weigh...

1847
01:31:25,871 --> 01:31:30,899
...what you ;ose and win?

1848
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:36,179
Stupidities...

1849
01:31:36,348 --> 01:31:38,373
Meaning;ess and point;ess ...

1850
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:40,509
Need;ess and thought;ess...

1851
01:31:40,619 --> 01:31:43,782
Unnecessary stupidities...

1852
01:31:43,889 --> 01:31:48,826
Stupidities...

1853
01:31:49,028 --> 01:31:51,053
Meaning;ess and point;ess ...

1854
01:31:51,163 --> 01:31:53,131
Need;ess and thought;ess...

1855
01:31:53,232 --> 01:31:57,896
Unnecessary stupidities...

1856
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:05,477
Thank you sir...

1857
01:32:08,848 --> 01:32:11,316
Negi...who are those
couples at table 3 and 12?

1858
01:32:11,617 --> 01:32:13,847
They've been occupying those tables
for the last three hours...

1859
01:32:14,053 --> 01:32:16,419
Get them out!
- They're penniless lovers sir...

1860
01:32:16,488 --> 01:32:18,285
Where will they go
for their love talk?

1861
01:32:18,757 --> 01:32:20,384
If they go home,
parents will slap them...

1862
01:32:20,459 --> 01:32:22,256
If they go to a park,
cops will shoo them away...

1863
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:24,253
They're sitting here
quietly cooing...let them...

1864
01:32:24,363 --> 01:32:25,921
Why get into the business of love...

1865
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:28,322
when they're penniless!

1866
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,962
Yes Sir, boss's orders...

1867
01:32:31,036 --> 01:32:32,401
I'll shoo these love-birds away...

1868
01:32:32,571 --> 01:32:33,799
Hey senior-most ...

1869
01:32:34,373 --> 01:32:35,601
First put that stick aside...

1870
01:32:35,708 --> 01:32:37,972
Give them a cappuccino each,

1871
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:39,769
and tell them they won't
get anything for free after this!

1872
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:41,908
If they want to sit here,
they'll have to spend...

1873
01:32:42,047 --> 01:32:43,275
Or else, out in an hour...

1874
01:32:43,582 --> 01:32:45,812
My love mantra touched
you as well, right?

1875
01:32:45,918 --> 01:32:47,044
Yes bro, I'm really touched...

1876
01:32:47,152 --> 01:32:48,244
Shall I give them
both a brownie as well?

1877
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,719
Shall I throw you out?

1878
01:32:50,756 --> 01:32:52,690
You're something else...
try to be happy...

1879
01:32:52,892 --> 01:32:53,790
Hi..

1880
01:32:54,493 --> 01:32:56,256
Hey, you're back!

1881
01:32:56,896 --> 01:32:58,659
Sir this is Manju...

1882
01:32:58,998 --> 01:33:01,296
She'd gone to Rohtak
for her cousin's wedding...

1883
01:33:01,734 --> 01:33:02,962
This is our Mohit Sir...

1884
01:33:03,736 --> 01:33:04,930
Hello sir ...
- Hi Manju ...

1885
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:06,026
Sir I'll just be back...

1886
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,038
Sir Manju is my GF

1887
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:14,171
I can see that.

1888
01:33:14,647 --> 01:33:16,478
Now I'll enjoy my work...

1889
01:33:16,582 --> 01:33:17,913
Sir
- Yeah?

1890
01:33:18,017 --> 01:33:21,453
Don't mind, but your
professional story is very sad...

1891
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,681
But your love story
can be easily solved..

1892
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:27,520
..by saying sorry to each other.
- Manju, by god!

1893
01:33:27,726 --> 01:33:30,160
Her mother calls
her 'Big-mouth Manju'...

1894
01:33:30,329 --> 01:33:32,229
I'm never going to
tell you anything now...

1895
01:33:32,331 --> 01:33:34,026
I'm sorry I told her sir...

1896
01:33:34,133 --> 01:33:35,657
Other than this,
your secret is a top secret...

1897
01:33:35,734 --> 01:33:37,531
It's her fault...
she should say sorry...why should I?

1898
01:33:37,603 --> 01:33:39,298
But Sir, just listen...
Just talk to her once and see...

1899
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:41,032
Let's go Manju...
Sir has a very bad temper!

1900
01:33:41,106 --> 01:33:42,971
Hey let me just talk
to him for a second...

1901
01:33:49,848 --> 01:33:50,974
That liar!

1902
01:33:51,317 --> 01:33:52,477
Jobless...

1903
01:33:53,118 --> 01:33:56,178
...dependent on Mayera
for the last two months!

1904
01:33:57,856 --> 01:33:59,983
I should have sent him to jail!

1905
01:34:00,993 --> 01:34:03,052
Don't know why I'm
so confused about him...

1906
01:34:03,162 --> 01:34:05,858
Sir, the Government never
respected your goodness...

1907
01:34:05,998 --> 01:34:07,260
transfer upon transfer...

1908
01:34:07,533 --> 01:34:09,228
But God is watching Sir,

1909
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,734
he saved you and our
Mayera at the last minute...

1910
01:34:12,805 --> 01:34:14,397
No more scope for confusion.

1911
01:34:15,607 --> 01:34:18,440
Tell madam to give me whatever
money is due for these rings...

1912
01:34:18,544 --> 01:34:20,569
Sir patience sir patience...

1913
01:34:21,146 --> 01:34:22,636
But I didn't understand one thing...

1914
01:34:22,715 --> 01:34:24,683
Once he had broken up with Mayera,

1915
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,342
why did he go out
of his way to help you?

1916
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:29,046
Logically speaking,
he shouldn't have...

1917
01:34:29,855 --> 01:34:31,720
I think it's a big conspiracy Sir...

1918
01:34:32,624 --> 01:34:36,253
In my humble opinion, pull
some strings and send him to jail...

1919
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:38,089
Gursharan Singh!

1920
01:34:39,098 --> 01:34:40,190
What an opinion.

1921
01:34:40,366 --> 01:34:44,564
Sir your luck is very good,
gold prices have shot up...

1922
01:34:44,803 --> 01:34:47,033
You've made a profit
of thirty seven thousand,

1923
01:34:47,106 --> 01:34:49,097
five hundred and eighty rupees...

1924
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:51,073
Thirty seven thousand...

1925
01:34:51,543 --> 01:34:53,738
Why did my luck
have to change today?

1926
01:34:53,946 --> 01:34:55,038
Bloody!

1927
01:34:55,114 --> 01:34:57,344
I don't want to sell...
thanks a lot for your assistance...

1928
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:58,747
Sir
- Sir

1929
01:34:58,817 --> 01:35:02,253
You raised one question
and cleared the entire matter...

1930
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:03,515
couldn't you have done this earlier?

1931
01:35:03,622 --> 01:35:05,522
I wouldn't have had to
bear such a big loss.

1932
01:35:05,624 --> 01:35:07,888
Sir what question did I raise sir?

1933
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,689
He had made me a promise...

1934
01:35:09,762 --> 01:35:11,696
and how could he break his promise?

1935
01:35:11,764 --> 01:35:14,494
He came to help me
even after the break up...

1936
01:35:14,633 --> 01:35:17,227
Wow! Look at the character
of that guy...

1937
01:35:17,302 --> 01:35:19,361
How can I leave a guy
with such a fine character?

1938
01:35:19,438 --> 01:35:22,669
Sir anyone can get a character
certificate by paying extra money...

1939
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:24,072
but the boy is jobless.

1940
01:35:24,143 --> 01:35:26,236
Yes he's jobless,

1941
01:35:26,345 --> 01:35:30,679
but he taught me that life
doesn't end but starts at sixty...

1942
01:35:30,749 --> 01:35:33,343
That duffer made me,
what is that, cool...

1943
01:35:33,419 --> 01:35:34,613
He made me cool!

1944
01:35:34,686 --> 01:35:37,678
He's an MBA,
sooner or later he'll get a job...

1945
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:38,950
That's ok Sir... but..

1946
01:35:39,058 --> 01:35:41,458
the thinking of the boy
and girl doesn't match yours...

1947
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:43,017
They are fighting...

1948
01:35:43,095 --> 01:35:44,187
Gursharan,

1949
01:35:44,763 --> 01:35:47,163
have Romeo and Juliet ever
come together without the villain?

1950
01:35:47,266 --> 01:35:48,756
No sir
- No!

1951
01:35:49,635 --> 01:35:52,570
This time as well the
villain will unite them.

1952
01:36:00,712 --> 01:36:02,509
Mayera!
- Where were you?

1953
01:36:02,614 --> 01:36:04,013
I've been trying your
phone for so long!

1954
01:36:04,316 --> 01:36:06,147
Give me the keys,
I need your passport...

1955
01:36:06,218 --> 01:36:08,186
Passport? Why?

1956
01:36:09,421 --> 01:36:12,356
What?
- Just hear me out...sit here...

1957
01:36:13,425 --> 01:36:14,323
What is this?

1958
01:36:15,828 --> 01:36:17,261
Our new house, in Dubai...

1959
01:36:17,329 --> 01:36:18,489
Our new house?

1960
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:21,294
Yes papa.. It's a
4 bedroom apartment...

1961
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,858
A kitchen that's bigger than
our living room, fully equipped.

1962
01:36:25,537 --> 01:36:27,198
Meet Mayera Sehgal papa...

1963
01:36:27,306 --> 01:36:29,137
new vice president
of the Dubai office...

1964
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,506
Double the salary,
that too in Dirham...

1965
01:36:31,777 --> 01:36:33,404
See, I did what you wanted!

1966
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:36,377
What?!

1967
01:36:37,883 --> 01:36:39,510
Now don't say you
don't want to go...

1968
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,177
because you don't have a choice...

1969
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:42,379
No silly...

1970
01:36:42,488 --> 01:36:44,979
I'm in shock, with happiness...

1971
01:36:45,057 --> 01:36:47,525
It's the best decision
of your life...

1972
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,026
Here are the keys...

1973
01:36:49,528 --> 01:36:51,496
But we have to pack
up the house in two days,

1974
01:36:51,563 --> 01:36:53,531
if I don't join on Monday
the offer will be cancelled..

1975
01:36:53,632 --> 01:36:54,860
Don't worry, I'm there...

1976
01:36:54,933 --> 01:36:56,992
I'll do what's correct for you...

1977
01:36:57,069 --> 01:36:59,560
That Mohit, that useless Mohit...

1978
01:36:59,638 --> 01:37:01,663
Imagine if you'd
gotten married to him,

1979
01:37:01,773 --> 01:37:04,071
would you have been
able to move to Dubai?

1980
01:37:04,476 --> 01:37:06,205
Radha, did you get the cartons?

1981
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:07,575
Yes...

1982
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:10,976
Don't worry, we won't leave
without taking our revenge...

1983
01:37:11,183 --> 01:37:14,346
I have told Gursharan to
make a fake case against him

1984
01:37:14,419 --> 01:37:17,217
and send him to Tihar jail...

1985
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:19,784
Papa are you mad?

1986
01:37:19,892 --> 01:37:23,953
First they will break his
bones with the Tihar sticks,

1987
01:37:24,029 --> 01:37:26,429
that'll really be breaking
Mr. Mohit up!

1988
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:27,724
What fun!

1989
01:37:27,833 --> 01:37:29,300
You're just too much!

1990
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,125
Call Gursharan Uncle right now...

1991
01:37:31,203 --> 01:37:32,636
Stop him, come on...

1992
01:37:32,704 --> 01:37:35,537
Will you feel bad
if that rogue is in pain?

1993
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:40,309
If you love him so much,
why are you running away to Dubai?

1994
01:37:40,412 --> 01:37:42,209
I'll get out of your way...

1995
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:46,715
Now you're getting confused,
should I go to Dubai or not...

1996
01:37:46,985 --> 01:37:48,850
To be or not to be...

1997
01:37:48,954 --> 01:37:50,945
Romeo and Juliet...

1998
01:37:52,357 --> 01:37:53,654
There's no confusion...

1999
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:57,551
I just don't want any new problem
to come up and keep us behind...

2000
01:37:58,697 --> 01:37:59,959
Talk to Gursharan uncle...

2001
01:38:02,834 --> 01:38:05,928
Yes Gursharan
Tihar-plan cancelled...

2002
01:38:07,372 --> 01:38:08,168
Happy?

2003
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:15,078
Hey Gursharan my friend...
nobody has to be sent to Tihar...

2004
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,204
Now listen to me,

2005
01:38:16,582 --> 01:38:19,483
Mayera has taken both
our passports to Ajanta Travels

2006
01:38:19,585 --> 01:38:21,018
for the tickets and visa...

2007
01:38:21,253 --> 01:38:24,154
You have to set up something
at the travel agency so

2008
01:38:24,223 --> 01:38:26,384
that we don't get the visas...

2009
01:38:26,592 --> 01:38:27,650
Now you understand?

2010
01:38:27,726 --> 01:38:29,819
Yes, we shouldn't get the visas!

2011
01:38:29,895 --> 01:38:30,623
Good...

2012
01:38:31,096 --> 01:38:32,154
Yes!

2013
01:38:34,066 --> 01:38:36,660
Come on Mohit, answer the phone...

2014
01:38:37,336 --> 01:38:38,826
Oh hell!

2015
01:38:40,405 --> 01:38:42,965
Now how do I contact this duffer?

2016
01:38:50,916 --> 01:38:52,110
You sir...?
- Yes.

2017
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:53,707
Sir...Mohit was just here...

2018
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:55,286
I think he's gone
to the conference room...

2019
01:38:55,387 --> 01:38:58,515
Will you keep lying all your life,
to save your friend?

2020
01:38:59,524 --> 01:39:00,491
Not lying...

2021
01:39:00,892 --> 01:39:03,087
Where is he? Tell me the truth.

2022
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:06,298
He's changed his number,
doesn't reply to emails...

2023
01:39:06,298 --> 01:39:07,629
I don't know Sir,
he's just disappeared...

2024
01:39:09,901 --> 01:39:10,731
Think!

2025
01:39:11,503 --> 01:39:14,597
There must be someone
who can tell us about him...

2026
01:39:17,242 --> 01:39:19,142
Think carefully,

2027
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,838
the Home Secretary was my batch mate!

2028
01:39:24,349 --> 01:39:26,840
By God, what happened to
Mohit was very unfortunate...

2029
01:39:26,918 --> 01:39:30,149
I tried to tell him,
don't show off your automatic car,

2030
01:39:30,222 --> 01:39:31,314
who knows you may not
have even a cycle tomorrow!

2031
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:32,584
He didn't listen to me...

2032
01:39:32,858 --> 01:39:34,325
But where is he?

2033
01:39:36,094 --> 01:39:38,688
Stop bro, stop...Sir over there...

2034
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:40,755
Very good...Thank you Master.

2035
01:39:40,932 --> 01:39:43,162
Ok lmmy, thank you...
- Welcome sir.

2036
01:39:56,915 --> 01:39:58,177
Hey waiter!

2037
01:40:07,526 --> 01:40:08,925
Bloody good!

2038
01:40:08,994 --> 01:40:10,256
How can I help you sir?

2039
01:40:11,263 --> 01:40:13,891
Do you get a salary,
or are you on daily wages?

2040
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:16,824
Which coffee sir?

2041
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:21,771
Hmm, get me a Cappuccino...

2042
01:40:21,873 --> 01:40:24,740
and a cup of tea for you.
It's on me...

2043
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:27,037
No thanks... One cappuccino please!

2044
01:40:27,579 --> 01:40:28,443
Anything else?

2045
01:40:29,548 --> 01:40:31,072
How about a brownie ...

2046
01:40:31,683 --> 01:40:33,048
Let me help increase your sales,

2047
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:34,585
you must be getting
a commission huh?

2048
01:40:37,089 --> 01:40:38,283
Bring it out please.

2049
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:42,724
Let the ;ove never be ;ess,
; wi;; take every other ;oss...

2050
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:47,788
Let the ;ove never be ;ess...

2051
01:40:47,899 --> 01:40:52,097
; wi;; take every other ;oss...

2052
01:40:52,471 --> 01:40:53,563
Hey boy!

2053
01:40:54,106 --> 01:40:56,870
What shoddy service is this?
Clean the damn table!

2054
01:41:05,016 --> 01:41:06,210
Take it...

2055
01:41:06,618 --> 01:41:09,849
You can get your new
girlfriend peanuts with it...

2056
01:41:10,021 --> 01:41:12,489
And this time look for
someone who is of your status.

2057
01:41:13,325 --> 01:41:14,451
Why have you come here?

2058
01:41:14,526 --> 01:41:18,428
To tell you that Mayera
is moving to Dubai.

2059
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,131
It hurts doesn't it?

2060
01:41:24,403 --> 01:41:26,268
How you both used to boast...

2061
01:41:26,671 --> 01:41:29,231
''We can eat love,
we can wear love''

2062
01:41:29,474 --> 01:41:32,568
''we can fill love in the
petrol tank and drive off...''

2063
01:41:33,345 --> 01:41:34,403
So where is all that love?

2064
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,414
Now do you understand
the value of money?

2065
01:41:38,216 --> 01:41:41,379
As always,
Mayera is smarter than you..

2066
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,753
She's taken a transfer to Dubai...

2067
01:41:44,623 --> 01:41:47,592
In a week's time Dubai will
make her forget the pain, and you...

2068
01:41:48,226 --> 01:41:50,592
You just keep selling
your tea coffee here...

2069
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:56,698
You think you're very smart,
but you're just a big duffer!

2070
01:41:56,802 --> 01:42:01,068
Don't you understand
Mayera is spoilt...

2071
01:42:01,139 --> 01:42:03,699
She's gotten used
to the 5 Star life...

2072
01:42:04,142 --> 01:42:06,007
You should be happy
the marriage didn't happen,

2073
01:42:06,077 --> 01:42:07,908
she would have made you bankrupt!

2074
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:10,743
See, as soon as you
lost your money,

2075
01:42:10,849 --> 01:42:13,784
that snob tossed you aside like
an insignificant fly!

2076
01:42:13,852 --> 01:42:15,319
You're calling your
own daughter a snob?

2077
01:42:15,387 --> 01:42:17,412
Why are you feeling bad?

2078
01:42:18,256 --> 01:42:20,190
What does she mean to you now?

2079
01:42:21,426 --> 01:42:24,224
Anyway, she's dumping
you and going...

2080
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:25,626
that too in business class!

2081
01:42:26,565 --> 01:42:28,965
After this, don't ever let yourself
fall in love with a money-minded,

2082
01:42:29,034 --> 01:42:31,025
selfish, opportunist like Mayera...

2083
01:42:31,102 --> 01:42:33,366
Enough Mr. Sehgal!
This is too much..

2084
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:34,761
You've said enough...

2085
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,005
Now if you say even
one word against Mayera I'll...

2086
01:42:37,075 --> 01:42:39,509
You'll what? What will you do?

2087
01:42:40,245 --> 01:42:43,271
The Romeo passion doesn't
go well with empty pockets...

2088
01:42:44,082 --> 01:42:46,312
You flaunt your love
like you're some millionare

2089
01:42:46,885 --> 01:42:50,218
but you're just a bloody waiter!!

2090
01:42:50,555 --> 01:42:53,353
We're leaving for
the airport in about three hours...

2091
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,288
understood?

2092
01:42:54,493 --> 01:42:58,190
If I see you within a five kilometer
radius of the airport...

2093
01:42:58,296 --> 01:43:01,754
remember, the Home Secretary
is my batch mate!

2094
01:43:01,867 --> 01:43:03,129
Excuse me!

2095
01:43:03,535 --> 01:43:06,629
Your photo will go
to the home department...

2096
01:43:06,905 --> 01:43:09,430
Then it will flash to every PCR van,
Black Cats,

2097
01:43:09,508 --> 01:43:13,274
NSG commandos, CRPF, RAW agents...

2098
01:43:14,513 --> 01:43:16,037
Don't you ever mess with us

2099
01:43:16,114 --> 01:43:18,082
and stay away from my daughter!

2100
01:43:18,316 --> 01:43:19,442
Bloody waiter!

2101
01:43:33,932 --> 01:43:35,024
She's moving to Dubai...

2102
01:43:35,867 --> 01:43:37,459
She could have atleast told me that!

2103
01:43:38,036 --> 01:43:40,129
Sir there's no point
in being sad right now...

2104
01:43:40,205 --> 01:43:42,173
Just go say sorry to ma'am,
and stop her from leaving.

2105
01:43:42,274 --> 01:43:43,468
How can I just go
and apologize to her?

2106
01:43:44,109 --> 01:43:46,669
She's the one who broke up first.
She'll have to say sorry first.

2107
01:43:46,745 --> 01:43:48,474
Sir it's not a race...

2108
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,878
If you're going to let your
ego become as big as an airplane,

2109
01:43:50,949 --> 01:43:53,679
Ma'am will simply fly away!
And you'll be left wondering forever

2110
01:43:53,985 --> 01:43:55,213
Bloody waiter....

2111
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,220
Sir, that old man
has insulted all of us...

2112
01:43:57,322 --> 01:43:59,449
You've to give it back to
that rotten fellow!

2113
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:02,823
Yes Sir, steal Mayera away
from right under his nose...

2114
01:44:02,894 --> 01:44:04,384
That will be a fitting reply.

2115
01:44:05,964 --> 01:44:06,988
Are you done with the lecturing?

2116
01:44:07,465 --> 01:44:10,866
Enough of me and my life...
get back to work.

2117
01:44:10,936 --> 01:44:12,904
Sir please listen to me...
- I said get back to work!!

2118
01:44:17,642 --> 01:44:19,439
Hey! Stop right here...

2119
01:44:19,744 --> 01:44:20,802
Yes...Stop...

2120
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,575
How much?
- Forty five sir...

2121
01:44:24,082 --> 01:44:25,174
Keep the change...

2122
01:44:25,617 --> 01:44:27,847
Where were you papa? Hurry up
and get ready or we will get late...

2123
01:44:27,919 --> 01:44:29,511
I'll just get ready...

2124
01:44:29,588 --> 01:44:30,714
Gursharan done?
- Ma'am please sign here...

2125
01:44:30,822 --> 01:44:32,153
No, not done sir.

2126
01:44:32,223 --> 01:44:34,157
Not done what?
- What done? Not done?

2127
01:44:34,225 --> 01:44:35,249
What? No nothing...

2128
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:36,222
Go inside!

2129
01:44:36,528 --> 01:44:39,986
Ma'am your passports with
Dubai Visa ... and tickets.

2130
01:44:40,398 --> 01:44:42,764
Radha, you've latched
all the windows properly right?

2131
01:44:42,867 --> 01:44:44,630
Yes!
- And switched off the gas?

2132
01:44:44,736 --> 01:44:46,465
I have...
- Ok alright!

2133
01:44:46,571 --> 01:44:49,631
Give all your papers
to Gursharan uncle...

2134
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:51,368
And come here to
clean up every Saturday,

2135
01:44:51,443 --> 01:44:53,411
otherwise I won't
come back to get you...

2136
01:44:53,478 --> 01:44:55,207
Sis, don't go please...

2137
01:44:55,413 --> 01:44:57,210
Why are you crying?

2138
01:44:57,616 --> 01:44:59,345
I'm coming back to get you, ok?

2139
01:44:59,884 --> 01:45:02,114
Please don't go sis...
- Stupid girl!

2140
01:45:02,187 --> 01:45:04,052
I will miss you a lot...

2141
01:45:07,459 --> 01:45:11,327
Ok now stop crying
and take all the bags out, ok?

2142
01:45:14,199 --> 01:45:16,667
Sir in my humble opinion ...

2143
01:45:17,736 --> 01:45:19,533
What do we do about the rings?

2144
01:45:21,439 --> 01:45:23,464
I've never abused
so much in my life...

2145
01:45:25,143 --> 01:45:27,338
I called my own daughter proud...

2146
01:45:28,813 --> 01:45:31,247
I tell you, these two
are more stubborn than me...

2147
01:45:33,852 --> 01:45:36,116
I don't know whether gold prices
are up or down now...

2148
01:45:36,187 --> 01:45:37,984
but sell them irrespective of
whether they fetch a profit or loss!

2149
01:45:38,323 --> 01:45:40,052
And deposit the
money in my account...

2150
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,093
I guess this time too Romeo
and Juliet will have a tragic end.

2151
01:45:47,866 --> 01:45:48,890
Sir,
- What?

2152
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:50,298
Sir, please come here...
- What's the matter?

2153
01:45:50,402 --> 01:45:51,699
Sir see!
- What?

2154
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:57,574
Now let's make sure
he doesn't go free!

2155
01:45:57,642 --> 01:46:00,941
Gursharan pick up a weapon!

2156
01:46:01,012 --> 01:46:02,604
Wait Sir, I'm coming too...
- No, you wait here...

2157
01:46:02,681 --> 01:46:04,410
Sir that mad old man is dangerous...

2158
01:46:04,516 --> 01:46:07,485
I know, but after all
he is my father-in-law...

2159
01:46:08,119 --> 01:46:09,143
Careful sir ...

2160
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,059
Brother Mohit

2161
01:46:18,329 --> 01:46:19,762
Beware!

2162
01:46:20,131 --> 01:46:23,931
Don't you dare take a single step,
or I'll handicap you...

2163
01:46:24,469 --> 01:46:26,733
Gursharan call the
Police Commissioner...

2164
01:46:26,805 --> 01:46:27,897
Yes Sir!

2165
01:46:27,972 --> 01:46:31,373
The Home Secretary...
- Yes, I know, he's your batch-mate.

2166
01:46:31,643 --> 01:46:33,133
But I don't want to talk to you...

2167
01:46:33,812 --> 01:46:35,973
Call Mayera... Call her...

2168
01:46:36,347 --> 01:46:38,542
Mayera, Mayera...

2169
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:39,981
Mayera...

2170
01:46:42,987 --> 01:46:45,319
Why should Mayera come?

2171
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:48,985
Who are you, just a waiter?

2172
01:46:50,962 --> 01:46:54,989
First earn some money,
have a bank balance...

2173
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:58,433
My Mayera won't go with a loser...

2174
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:01,968
She's come to her senses now,
you bloody penny-pincher!

2175
01:47:02,073 --> 01:47:03,301
Sir reality check...

2176
01:47:03,775 --> 01:47:06,141
You're behaving very,
very uncool right now Sir...

2177
01:47:06,644 --> 01:47:09,977
Insulting my waiter friends,
uncool...

2178
01:47:10,315 --> 01:47:13,876
Calling Mayera proud, uncool...

2179
01:47:14,185 --> 01:47:18,144
And your hundred year old
money-theory, that's uncool too...

2180
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:20,214
If one followed your theory,

2181
01:47:20,391 --> 01:47:22,689
the poor would not be
allowed to love or live...

2182
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:25,457
If there is love,

2183
01:47:26,731 --> 01:47:30,132
thirty rupees
and one cup of coffee...

2184
01:47:32,904 --> 01:47:34,030
is enough to be happy...

2185
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,737
What if there's no money,

2186
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:38,804
there's unlimited love...

2187
01:47:41,112 --> 01:47:43,808
Money or no money,
loves finds it's way...

2188
01:47:43,882 --> 01:47:46,680
Where there's love, there's a way...

2189
01:47:46,751 --> 01:47:48,514
She hates you...

2190
01:47:48,586 --> 01:47:51,077
And you must know,
we were going to pray

2191
01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:54,056
at the hanuman temple
on the way to the airport...

2192
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:55,922
that you are never happy in life...

2193
01:47:56,027 --> 01:47:58,359
You bloody loser...
- Papa enough ...

2194
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:00,988
What has Mohit done to you?

2195
01:48:01,499 --> 01:48:02,796
He agreed to the probation...

2196
01:48:02,901 --> 01:48:04,300
He lost all the matches with you...

2197
01:48:04,402 --> 01:48:07,769
He's the national level under-16
silver medalist in squash...

2198
01:48:07,872 --> 01:48:09,066
yet he lost all matches for you...

2199
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,835
He helped you
with your job-hunting...

2200
01:48:10,942 --> 01:48:13,376
lied to me for you...

2201
01:48:13,511 --> 01:48:16,844
He calls you Osama, but you're
not less than a terrorist...

2202
01:48:16,948 --> 01:48:20,042
he kept tolerating you, for me...

2203
01:48:24,222 --> 01:48:25,814
The man who can do so much for me,

2204
01:48:26,624 --> 01:48:28,251
can also give his life for me...

2205
01:48:33,264 --> 01:48:36,893
Waiter or manager,
pauper or prince,

2206
01:48:38,236 --> 01:48:39,100
I love him...

2207
01:48:41,105 --> 01:48:42,970
Some sacrifices will
have to be made...

2208
01:48:43,208 --> 01:48:44,903
I won't get to go to rock shows,

2209
01:48:44,976 --> 01:48:47,444
dinner once a month,
shopping once a year...

2210
01:48:47,512 --> 01:48:49,844
Hey hey...l'm not going to
work at a coffee shop all my life...

2211
01:48:49,948 --> 01:48:51,813
Until you do...

2212
01:48:52,283 --> 01:48:53,341
We will still have fun...

2213
01:48:55,386 --> 01:48:57,752
Without you I don't
enjoy shopping at all,

2214
01:48:58,389 --> 01:49:01,415
whatever the credit card limit...

2215
01:49:02,393 --> 01:49:04,258
Because when you're not around,
there's nobody to say...

2216
01:49:04,362 --> 01:49:06,762
Very hot...shall I gobble you up!

2217
01:49:20,511 --> 01:49:23,503
Hey...no hanky-panky here...
all this after marriage...

2218
01:49:23,615 --> 01:49:24,843
What's going on dad?

2219
01:49:25,617 --> 01:49:27,585
Weren't you very happy
with our break-up?

2220
01:49:27,952 --> 01:49:29,476
Your generation always has to do

2221
01:49:29,554 --> 01:49:31,681
the opposite of what
the parents say...

2222
01:49:31,756 --> 01:49:33,053
It's always the case...

2223
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:35,016
Papa you are crazy

2224
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,855
If I had listed his good qualities

2225
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:41,096
would you say sorry
and patch up with him? No!

2226
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:43,326
I abused him only then
did you understand...

2227
01:49:44,469 --> 01:49:45,663
Hey, stupid!

2228
01:49:45,770 --> 01:49:48,739
You call me uncool, you bloody fool!

2229
01:49:49,007 --> 01:49:51,032
If you want to be my
son-in-law take my blessings...

2230
01:49:53,177 --> 01:49:55,270
Not like this, give me hug...

2231
01:49:55,346 --> 01:49:56,608
A good one...

2232
01:49:56,681 --> 01:49:57,875
Stupid fellow...

2233
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:00,044
Come here!

2234
01:50:01,152 --> 01:50:02,380
Now give the rings...

2235
01:50:02,754 --> 01:50:07,191
Your wish means everything,
and mine means nothing...

2236
01:50:07,258 --> 01:50:08,555
Which wish?

2237
01:50:08,626 --> 01:50:10,560
Today is my interview...

2238
01:50:10,662 --> 01:50:11,788
I have to go there...

2239
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:14,729
Rings can wait...
- Papa!

2240
01:50:14,799 --> 01:50:16,357
Let him go, otherwise
he will never leave us alone...

2241
01:50:16,434 --> 01:50:17,560
He won't be able
to take the pressure

2242
01:50:17,635 --> 01:50:18,761
of a private job at his age.

2243
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:19,996
He's letting you
decide for yourself...

2244
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:21,195
Let him do the same...

2245
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:23,498
Dear in my humble opinion,
he's right...

2246
01:50:24,609 --> 01:50:26,133
Ok...fine guys.

2247
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:34,447
So...how am I looking?

2248
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,284
Don't you have a suit?
- Suit.

2249
01:50:38,723 --> 01:50:41,715
I got a new Safari suit made
for this, from Singh Tailors...

2250
01:50:41,826 --> 01:50:42,952
four pockets.

2251
01:50:43,127 --> 01:50:45,857
Suit and tie please!
- Oh bloody

2252
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:47,625
Where are you taking me?
- Come on, come on...

2253
01:50:47,732 --> 01:50:49,563
Gursharan I am being kidnapped...
- C'mon!

2254
01:50:49,634 --> 01:50:52,296
Oh wait, you guys have
sandwiched me in between!

2255
01:50:52,403 --> 01:50:54,200
The sandwich needs a good tie!

2256
01:50:54,272 --> 01:50:55,637
Hello Unni sir ...
I love you too much...

2257
01:50:55,707 --> 01:50:56,901
I can't leave you and go to Dubai...

2258
01:51:04,282 --> 01:51:06,512
How crowded this place is...

2259
01:51:06,617 --> 01:51:08,676
come on guys...come on...

2260
01:51:08,786 --> 01:51:12,119
You'll shift out of this hole in
the wall after marriage, wont you?

2261
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,715
Say sorry sir...I take offence...

2262
01:51:14,826 --> 01:51:16,316
Say sorry sir or no tie...

2263
01:51:16,394 --> 01:51:19,056
Sorry, bro sorry!

2264
01:51:20,898 --> 01:51:23,765
Please get me sober tie,
according to my age...

2265
01:51:23,868 --> 01:51:25,961
Young and dynamic sir.

2266
01:51:26,204 --> 01:51:28,638
Where are you going?
- He'll get something silly...

2267
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:30,708
Ok, choose a good one...

2268
01:51:47,091 --> 01:51:50,754
I missed you.
- I know man, where were you...

2269
01:52:07,845 --> 01:52:09,676
Osama
- Crap!

2270
01:52:14,152 --> 01:52:15,050
Killer!

2271
01:52:20,425 --> 01:52:24,225
Sir don't show off in the interview,

2272
01:52:24,295 --> 01:52:25,762
that the home Secretary
is your batch mate...

2273
01:52:25,863 --> 01:52:29,196
It'll give a good impression...
you won't understand...

2274
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:31,063
Papa, it doesn't make
a difference to anyone...

2275
01:52:31,135 --> 01:52:32,602
Really,
- Yeah!

2276
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:35,002
I thought that's why
Mohit is scared of me...

2277
01:52:35,173 --> 01:52:36,970
You're not scared of me?

2278
01:52:37,075 --> 01:52:38,133
Hey duffer...

2279
01:52:40,244 --> 01:52:41,768
Don't scare anyone.

2280
01:52:41,879 --> 01:52:43,574
You're going for an interview,
not to pick a son-in-law...

2281
01:52:43,648 --> 01:52:46,048
I know ya... I'm your father
you are not my father.

2282
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:48,050
Sehgal VK
- They're asking for your name...

2283
01:52:48,152 --> 01:52:50,279
not for your email ID!
- Vinod Kumar Sehgal...

2284
01:52:50,354 --> 01:52:52,254
VK Sehgal
- This way sir.

2285
01:52:56,761 --> 01:52:59,696

2287
01:53:01,432 --> 01:53:02,296

2288
01:53:02,533 --> 01:53:04,398
Top class coffee for top class GF...

2289
01:53:04,702 --> 01:53:07,535
Sir, take one cup... and share

2290
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,370
Idea!

2291
01:53:10,908 --> 01:53:12,933
Your financing skills,
and my marketing...

2292
01:53:13,177 --> 01:53:14,201
lets open a coffee shop..

2293
01:53:14,679 --> 01:53:17,045
I've understood one
thing from all this...

2294
01:53:17,348 --> 01:53:20,215
even if they have no money,
people don't stop drinking coffee...

2295
01:53:20,618 --> 01:53:23,451
Brilliant...and we will
call it One Cup Coffee...

2296
01:53:23,521 --> 01:53:24,818
No ya...
- Why not?!

2297
01:53:24,889 --> 01:53:26,481
Then people will drink only one cup!

2298
01:53:26,657 --> 01:53:28,557
Listen, I will keep the name...

2299
01:53:28,659 --> 01:53:30,957
The home Secretary
is my papa's batch-mate ok!

2300
01:53:31,195 --> 01:53:34,323
I'm going to gobble
this Home Secretary up...

2301
01:53:34,398 --> 01:53:35,330
Osama...

2302
01:53:37,068 --> 01:53:41,368
Oh no.. papa..
Don't worry its ok

2303
01:53:42,807 --> 01:53:45,901

01:53:45,977 --> 01:53:48,172
