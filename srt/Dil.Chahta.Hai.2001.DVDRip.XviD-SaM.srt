1
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,460
I'll check him tomorrow

2
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,640
Mister Sinha, this is a case
of liver cirrhosis

3
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,180
The liver is badly damaged.
The patient is under observation

4
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,390
It's difficult to say anything yet

5
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,250
But, you can do something?

6
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,990
The problem is, we can't do a liver
transplant... on such short notice

7
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,700
If you wish to inform her
family or relatives...

8
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,040
...you may use my phone

9
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,170
Hey buddy, how are you?
Where are you?

10
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,170
I'm at the hospital

11
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,030
Hospital! Are you okay?

12
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,540
Ya, I'm OK

13
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,870
So, what's wrong then?

14
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,520
Just hang in there. I'm coming

15
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,880
By the way, Akash is back in Bombay.
I'll bring him along

16
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,430
He won't come

17
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,420
Don't be silly. Forget what happened

18
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,330
He'll be very happy to
know you're here.

19
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,620
Ya Sameer, tell me

20
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,530
Maybe you should go meet him alone.
I don't want to come.

21
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,750
You are right.
Let bygones be bygones...

22
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
But what's happening now
isn't wrong either, is it?

23
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,480
I am living my life and Sid his

24
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,290
I really think you should
go meet him alone

25
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
Sameer, come home quickly.
Now. At once

26
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,250
Sameer! Akash! What's wrong?
What's the rush?

27
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,510
How do you like it?

28
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,060
Have you gone mad?

29
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,820
On the phone you sounded like somebody's
broken into your house!

30
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,100
What do you mean beautiful!?

31
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,350
But Sid... don't you think
she resembles someone?

32
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,440
Resembles whom?

33
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,590
What do you think, Sameer?

34
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,550
I think everybody resembles
some one or the other.

35
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,580
But she resembles Miss. Kashyap

36
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,430
Our Economics teacher?

37
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,790
Yes, sir. Our Economics teacher

38
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,430
No man!

39
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,930
Ya man. I know Miss. Kashyap
better than you

40
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:39,660
Tuitions...

41
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,370
I used to go to her for tuitions

42
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,550
At these tuitions, were there other
students or just the two of you?

43
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,780
What do you think?
- Just the two of you?

44
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,650
You are right, Akash

45
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,550
She does resemble Miss. Kashyap.
But guess where I've messed up?

46
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,390
You've got her figure wrong

47
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,230
What do you know about her figure?

48
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,110
I'm looking for Sid

49
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,960
Sinha... Siddharth Sinha

50
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,610
When did you return to Bombay?
- This morning.

51
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,390
Can't imagine what 'd have
happened if I wasn't here

52
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,020
How is she now?

53
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,860
Don't know. It's hard to say

54
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,930
Tell me about you.
What're you up to these days?

55
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,870
I'm working with Dad in his
computer business

56
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,240
Everything else is the same...

57
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,350
And you? Still at your uncle's place
in Poona?

58
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,020
Ya. It's a very nice.
You must come there sometime

59
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,360
Definitely man

60
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,890
Are you just saying that or
do you really intend on coming?

61
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,930
I intend on doing a lot of things
...like getting married

62
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,550
I always knew that the first to ge
married among us three would be you

63
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,720
Guess what! So is Akash

64
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,730
What! Akash! Getting married!?
That's funny

65
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,690
I'm not kidding!

66
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,660
No way!

67
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,450
But to whom? That girl who was
crazy about him in college?

68
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,410
Don't you remember her?

69
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,440
She used to say Akash's name
in that peculiar way!

70
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,480
God! Deepa is coming here!

71
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:28,240
Akash, let's dance. It'll make the
other couples jealous

72
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,540
Sure! Why not! Go ahead.
I'll be right with you

73
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,880
In three lifetimes from now

74
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,900
Sameer, please get me a drink.
I'm ever so thirsty

75
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,440
And throw in a dance or two with
Deepa while you're at it

76
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,190
What're you sketching?

77
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,210
Priya, isn't Sameer taking too
long to get your drink?

78
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,470
Did somebody just die?
- Yes... you!

79
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,300
Did I send you to get a drink
or chat up other girls!

80
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,970
I'm sure you have something
going on with her

81
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,650
I remember you were never home
when I was away on holiday

82
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,420
You've got it all wrong, Priya

83
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,880
How do you know her?

84
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,650
Did somebody just die?

85
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,000
Who is she?
- I don't know

86
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,070
You must have seen her somewhere!

87
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,200
That I have.
- Where?

88
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,500
She's over there

89
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,760
Priya, do you know her?

90
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,960
Forget it man. She doesn't
seem your type

91
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,760
I don't plan on marrying her!
Big deal about my type

92
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,730
And may I know what your type is?

93
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,310
One who lives her life
and lets me live mine

94
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,510
Someone not overtly emotional

95
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,410
Oh, I remember.
You once met such a girl

96
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,850
The affair lasted for two weeks!

97
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,240
That itself was too much

98
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,050
Anyway, I'm off...

99
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,780
...or she'll have had grandchildren
by the time I get there

100
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,620
Think about it.
I don't see her biting the hook

101
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,530
It's called the good-ole
Akash charm and it never fails

102
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,000
Is the mike leaking., where has 3 gone?

103
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,250
Today, on this all important
graduation day...

104
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,550
I have decided to sing a song

105
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,840
And because we are stepping
into a new world...

106
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,170
...where the responsibility to be
somebody will be thrust on us...

107
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,140
The title of the song is:
"A hundred ways to get a job"

108
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,690
Relax guys! I was only kidding!

109
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:10,010
If people say... that we are crazy,
then let them

110
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,160
We don't give a damn
about what they think

111
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,070
When we can play music
When we can sing...

112
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,940
Then why should we hesitate?

113
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,850
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

114
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,080
If the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

115
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,730
If the world quarrels...
- Let it quarrel

116
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,820
If the world fights...
- Just it fight.

117
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,590
Just keep right on singing

118
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,460
If the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

119
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,260
If ties are broken...
- Let them break

120
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,000
If someone leaves you...
- Let them go

121
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,870
Don't ever be afraid
We are today.

122
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,340
Why should our style be old?

123
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,310
There's lightning in our eyes.
A storm in our breath

124
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,740
What's fear, what's defeat?
We don't know what they mean

125
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,250
The earth and sky,
are created for us

126
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,130
I'm sure we could even
pluck the stars out of the night

127
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,900
Our abode is beyond the sky

128
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,240
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

129
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,050
We have been raised in the
land of dreams

130
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,550
We can be as shy as
we are openly affectionate

131
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:05,060
Mesmerising everybody
wherever we go...

132
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:12,230
...teaching you lovely women
the art of love

133
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,570
We know how to steal
a woman's heart and her sleep

134
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:26,250
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

135
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,990
If people say...
...that we are crazy, then let them

136
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,600
We don't give a damn
about what they think

137
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,870
When we can play music
When we can sing...

138
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,600
Then why should we hesitate?

139
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,220
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

140
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,060
If the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

141
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,930
If the world quarrels...
- Let it quarrel

142
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,760
If the world fights...
- Let it fight

143
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,560
Just keep right on singing

144
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,570
If the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

145
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,240
If ties are broken...
- Let them break

146
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,000
If someone leaves you...
- Let them go

147
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,900
Don't ever be afraid

148
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:31,570
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

149
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,640
Shalini... that's a lovely name

150
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,050
I haven't seen you before.
You're not from our college

151
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,890
You're right. I'm here with somebody

152
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,900
And now would you say yes to
dancing with this somebody?

153
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,130
The fact is that Rohit...

154
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,860
Rohit! Okay!
So you are Rohit's sister?

155
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,560
No. Actually I...

156
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,510
Rohit and I are very good friends.
Why, he's more like a brother

157
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,920
Not even if I told you
that I love you?

158
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,030
Yes, Shalini. I love you
and only you

159
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,460
My every breath...

160
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,090
...every heartbeat...

161
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,560
...every moment,
is for you, Shalini

162
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,170
I'm sure that I was born
so that I could love you

163
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,600
And you were born to become mine

164
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,080
You are mine, Shalini

165
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,240
And if you ask your heart...

166
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,010
...you will know that I speak
the truth.

167
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,790
Who are you?

168
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,170
Don't you recognize your brother Rohit?

169
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,470
You are Rohit? I mean,
you too- are Rohit?

170
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,440
I thought Shalini was that
other Rohit's sister.

171
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,640
Look, he's over there

172
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,320
Sameer...! Your name is Sameer?

173
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,230
So you've being lying to me all along!
That's really wrong of you

174
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,870
What can I say now...
You can see for yourself

175
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,600
He got me to believe that
his name was Rohit

176
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,780
Neither is he Rohit
nor Shalini my sister

177
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,680
Shalini is my fiancee

178
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,810
Fiancee...!

179
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,690
I don't like you being friends
with Akash at all

180
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,830
His behaviour the other night...
You know how embarrassed I was?

181
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,330
Let him do what he wants.

182
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,730
Just keep away from him

183
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,210
But Akash is my friend, Priya!

184
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,270
Like you don't have
any other friends?

185
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,710
Yes, I do... But he...

186
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,680
Just decide, Sameer. You can
either be with Akash or me!

187
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,050
I am thinking...

188
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,550
You need time to think
if you want to be with me!

189
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,960
Okay. So you want some time?

190
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,730
No!

191
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm going out with friends.
I'll be back by 2.00

192
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,840
If I don't hear from you before that,
I'll know what your answer is

193
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,780
Don't you think you are
over-reacting?

194
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:02,780
No

195
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,380
You've never seen me over-react.
If I do... then God help you!!

196
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,540
What are you doing!

197
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,980
Your bruise has turned a strange colour.
Have you seen it, Sid?

198
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,250
I'm glad you like it!
Do you want one?

199
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,390
Hey! Don't get that anger out on me man

200
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,490
Did I ask you to speak to Shalini?

201
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,760
No. But you could've at least helped me.
You just sat there!

202
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,870
Such a true friend! I think I'd be
better off befriending Rohit

203
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,240
I'd at least get some protection!

204
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,240
May God bless your unity. I'm off.

205
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,910
Where to? -Home.

206
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,150
Why? What's the hurry?
Right, Sameer?

207
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,580
Ya, man, chill. It's only
1'O' clock

208
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,350
In which country?
It's nearly 4 here!

209
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,310
I forgot to call Priya!

210
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,550
Why are you so scared of Priya?

211
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,910
I'm not scared of her

212
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,620
I don't want to hurt her
or lose her

213
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,690
Sameer, I can't understand
how you tolerate her

214
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,550
She seems more a boss
than a girlfriend!

215
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,700
Akash, I'm asking for help,
not your expert comments

216
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,530
What should I do?

217
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,560
What do you think?

218
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,030
I'll tell you what.
Call Priya and apologise

219
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,700
Tell her you will never meet
Akash again

220
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,240
You know I won't do that!

221
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,810
What if she gets hurt...
What if you lose her!

222
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,750
You'll never improve, will you

223
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,450
Why are you turning this
into such an issue?

224
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,720
Just call her, talk to her.
It'll all be okay

225
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,150
The thing is... but listen... You're not
...but I... what I'm saying...

226
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,850
I'm at Akash's

227
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,130
She hung up

228
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:02,990
What did you expect?

229
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,930
She'll say Sorry darling!

230
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,510
Enough is enough, Sameer.
Listen to me

231
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,970
Just go there and tell her
these tantrums won't work

232
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,580
If she wants to be with you,
she must follow your wishes

233
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,710
She's challenged your
self-respect, buddy

234
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,650
What are you doing? Be a man!

235
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,690
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- That's the way to go!

236
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,810
He's dead!

237
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,540
Oh, Priya?
- Please give Sameer the phone

238
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,390
But Sameer hasn't come here. I too am
looking for him since last night

239
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,850
What? Didn't he come there?

240
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,920
Careful man!
Only this eye is working

241
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,270
We need to talk

242
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,940
There's no need for that. I know
what you have to say

243
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,810
You know? - Yes

244
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,720
I spoke to Akash after our talk

245
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,110
Right! And?

246
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,840
He said you weren't at his house

247
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,050
Stop pretending! I can't believe
I did this to myself

248
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,260
I never knew you were such a liar

249
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,790
I don't want to see your
face ever again!

250
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,490
Could I be of any assistance?

251
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,470
It's not a problem at all

252
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,540
Oh God! What's in here?
- My things

253
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,420
Hang on. I'll get it from this side

254
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,770
If just one suitcase has reduced
us to this condition, then...

255
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,710
There's only two more like this

256
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,080
Is that all? Just two more?
Let's go

257
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,370
It's a nice house

258
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,080
It belongs to the company I work for

259
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,020
I am an interior designer...
Tara Jaiswal

260
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,460
What do you do?

261
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,260
I work as a porter on Sundays

262
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,830
And the rest of the week?

263
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,370
Normally if anyone asks me that, I say
anything that pops into my head

264
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,610
But I'll tell you the truth because
I think it might be of interest to you

265
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:44,710
I don't quite understand?

266
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,610
I mean you have three paintings in your
luggage and that's my vocation

267
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,830
May I see your paintings?

268
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,820
Of course

269
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:00,860
Where do you live?

270
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,430
The last house down this road.
You can come whenever you wish

271
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,080
Sid, I'm going to the office.
- Just a minute, Ma

272
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,140
I'm coming along. Just drop me off
at Sameer's

273
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,120
By the way, it's Anju's wedding
anniversary today

274
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,210
She'll be very disappointed
if you don't come

275
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,800
Is Siddharth home? - Yes

276
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,200
You are...? - I am Tara

277
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,230
Ma, this is Tara

278
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,270
Well, I'd better be going

279
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,880
Ya, you go ahead, I'll go myself.

280
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,910
All right. But you are coming
this evening, aren't you?

281
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,710
Where? - To Anju's!

282
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,890
Mom, I get extremely bored there

283
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,460
There are very few places in this world
where you don't get bored

284
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,360
Fine! Have it your way.

285
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,300
Please have a seat

286
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,570
I'd like to see your paintings first

287
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,940
The same theme here too

288
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,120
What theme?

289
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,520
I have learnt something about
you today

290
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,760
Something I couldn't see
at our first meeting

291
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,690
What's that?

292
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,340
The thing is, you meet people,
talk to them, laugh...

293
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,230
But there's a world within you...

294
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,640
...full of dreams, of fantasies...

295
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,680
...that you don't share with anyone

296
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,680
I wonder if those, who claim
to know you...

297
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,750
...really know you at all

298
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,170
What makes you say that?

299
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,880
The door is not open...
Entry is forbidden...

300
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,880
The box is tightly bound...
No one can steal anything...

301
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,720
And who can tell what feelings reflect
behind those shut eyelids...

302
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,350
I wonder what other secrets your
paintings hide within them...

303
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,700
Or within you perhaps

304
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,670
Why are you looking at me
like that?

305
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,040
Anyway, which do you think
is your best?

306
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,470
I have yet to create that one

307
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,250
Look at your face!
White as a sheet!

308
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,400
Look, I am very angry right now
and all because of you

309
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,730
Hey! I saved your life and
you are angry with me?

310
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,690
Saved my life?
- Absolutely!

311
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,400
This was bound to happen

312
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,270
Priya would've left you tomorrow
if not today. Know why?

313
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,110
Because she didn't love you,
she loved some other Sameer

314
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,010
He looked like you but was
someone else

315
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,950
You are not that- Sameer. You are the
Sameer I know, Sid knows...

316
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,580
And Priya could only hope to know

317
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,460
If you became that Sameer, our this
Sameer would be defeated!

318
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,990
I never thought of it like that...
- I know

319
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,830
Then pack your bags and let's go

320
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,670
Sid and I are waiting for you
in the car

321
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,410
Where are we going? - Goa!

322
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,630
Goa...?!

323
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,380
The heart wants...

324
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,910
The heart wants...

325
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,160
May these sparkling days never end

326
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,670
The heart wants...

327
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,400
May we never have to be
without our friends

328
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,500
May our days be full of poetry...

329
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,990
...our evenings dance and
nights sing.

330
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,650
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

331
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,330
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

332
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,660
The heart wants...

333
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,440
May these sparkling days
never end

334
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,010
The heart wants...

335
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,510
May we never have to be
without our friends

336
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,630
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

337
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,030
May this joy and light
be ours by right

338
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,530
Where's Akash?

339
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,640
There... behind the plant

340
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,150
Are you guys staying here too?

341
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,250
Not are... we were.
We are checking out

342
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,000
We've been staying here for a week.
Isn't that right, guys?

343
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,260
Yes, we've been here for a week

344
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,590
But Akash just got here today.
- Yes. I got here today

345
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,800
Akash! It's nice to see you haven't
lost your sense of humour!

346
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,770
Hey Sid, look over there!

347
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,300
Sid, did you hear that?
Someone's calling out my name

348
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,950
Go faster, buddy. Faster
This is the top speed

349
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,650
What an amazing place!

350
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,230
We should come to Goa every year,
for a week at least

351
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,160
What say, Sid?

352
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,000
What are you thinking?

353
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,910
I'm looking at that ship...

354
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,620
...that's about to disappear over
the horizon

355
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,710
The three of us are like that ship

356
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,380
Soon, we'll set out looking
for our destinations...

357
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,900
...and it might just be that
our destinations are different

358
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,630
I don't understand why
you're saying all this

359
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,210
Sid, we are all friends...

360
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:50,640
...for life

361
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:51,710
Of course we are

362
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,480
But who knows where life will
take each one of us

363
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,750
Ever wondered, let alone come
here every year for a week...

364
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,350
It may be difficult to meet
even once in 10 years

365
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,790
That won't happen, Sid

366
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,660
We were, are and will be friends.
Always

367
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,770
Anyway, shall we go?
Deepa must be waiting for you

368
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,910
Don't say must be waiting.
She is!

369
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,740
I told her Akash will meet her
by the poolside at 8 sharp!

370
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,360
How strange is this journey!

371
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:49,500
If you just think...
Each one of us is so unaware...

372
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,600
...of where he is destined to go...

373
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:59,440
...of what the future
holds for each of us

374
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,960
The heart wants...

375
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,630
May these sparkling days never end

376
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,100
The heart wants...

377
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,880
May we never have to be
without our friends

378
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,790
May our days be full of poetry...

379
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,260
...our evenings dance
and nights sing

380
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:51,230
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

381
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:02,240
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

382
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,450
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

383
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,950
May this joy and light
be ours by right

384
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,220
Deepa, why do you like Akash
so much?

385
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,910
What do you mean?

386
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,030
Sometimes I wonder why we
like and want someone

387
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,690
Why do you like him?

388
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,440
I don't know... I just do

389
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,970
Even knowing that Akash...
...doesn't love me

390
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,620
Yes... then too

391
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,120
Deepa you are a good-Iooking,
intelligent girl.

392
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,820
You can get anyone you want...

393
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,230
In that case, why can't
I have Akash!

394
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,400
I don't know that...

395
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,430
But I do know that if
you're ever in trouble,

396
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,470
And need Akash's help or support,
he'll do whatever he can for you.

397
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,350
But Deepa, you shouldn't
hope for things that...

398
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,090
Take a look at this sand

399
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,830
The tighter you try to grip it...

400
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,530
...the faster it slips
through your fingers

401
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,240
Have you donated your bag
to the hotel?

402
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,670
Actually, I've decided to
stay back for a few days

403
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,450
What?

404
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,940
Er... Kristine wants me to stay
for some more time

405
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,610
Kristine? that girl who...

406
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,820
Sid! Are you listening? Our friend has
decided to become a hippie!

407
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,270
If you hadn't brought me here,
I'd have never met her

408
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,670
She's Swiss. I was wondering...
why not go there...

409
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,210
...and start a bee farm.
Swiss honey is world famous...

410
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,650
Let's go Akash

411
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,200
What have I done! He was
better off with Priya

412
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:22,670
One more thing...

413
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,840
Please don't call my house
till I get back

414
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,900
So, did you have fun in Goa?

415
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,240
It was great. Have you been there?

416
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,170
Yes. Many years ago

417
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,220
Whose photographs are these?

418
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,850
Esha... my daughter

419
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,790
Oh, I haven't met her.
Where is she?

420
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,400
She lives with her father

421
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,700
9th April 95... exactly
on my birthday...

422
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,680
My husband gave me a gift...

423
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,830
You do meet your daughter,
don't you?

424
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:58,460
No

425
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:03,930
The Court doesn't permit me
to meet my daughter

426
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,240
Why?

427
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,140
My ex-husband is a very rich man

428
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,370
His lawyers were very smart and
capable

429
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,620
With the help of many false
witnesses, he proved...

430
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,650
...that I am not a good mother.
That I'm an alcoholic

431
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,300
An irresponsible woman
who drinks

432
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,330
You're nothing like that!

433
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,140
Oh for you to have been
the judge!

434
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,980
Anyway, what else
did you do there?

435
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,320
I'd like to paint you

436
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,990
Paint me?

437
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,540
Be back in two minutes

438
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,520
Are you going somewhere?

439
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,380
Sorry, I have to go

440
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,420
I just got a call from the site.
There's a problem

441
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,560
Have you given any thought
to your future?

442
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:49,930
No

443
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,640
I know it's my fault...

444
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,780
...I always thought, I'd give
you some time... You needed it.

445
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,310
It's my pampering that
has spoilt you

446
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:04,950
If this goes on...

447
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,180
You'll definitely have signed
a cheque till my retirement

448
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:12,290
Dad, there are more things
to life than signing cheques

449
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,330
Really! And what are these things?

450
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,060
I don't know yet but the moment
I do, you'll be the first to know

451
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,540
I have had enough of your jokes

452
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,970
I've decided that you will go
to Australia

453
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,110
Cool! Another holiday?

454
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,740
You'll manage our business
there

455
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,250
Mom, Dad's joking now

456
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,090
No, Akash. Dad is serious
and you better be serious too

457
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:45,860
You are going to Sydney

458
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,330
And you will manage the office there

459
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,470
Sameerji's Mummyji is on the phone

460
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,090
Akash Baba says that...

461
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:13,710
Yes, Aunty

462
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,760
What's wrong with Sameer?

463
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,360
Nothing's wrong with Sameer.
He's perfectly OK

464
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,360
What OK!? He's shut himself
in his room

465
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,930
He hasn't eaten and just
doesn't come out

466
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,600
Sameer is in Bombay?

467
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,870
Didn't you all come back
last night

468
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,630
Yes, Aunty. It was last night
but... I'm so distracted now...

469
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,780
Akash, are you and Sameer on drugs?

470
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,740
Of course not, Aunty. Don't worry.
I'll be there right away

471
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,490
The least you could've done was call.

472
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,630
I didn't know what to say to your Mom

473
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,370
What's happened to you?

474
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,740
I'm in no mood to talk now

475
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,020
Okay. How's Kristine?

476
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,410
Don't even mention her name
in front of me!

477
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,750
Why? What happened?

478
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:26,160
Get it off your chest

479
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,770
It's not good for health
to suppress such emotions

480
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:38,840
Well, after the two of left
the other day...

481
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,940
I met Kristine on the beach

482
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,280
It felt so good...

483
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,010
Just Kristine and me...

484
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:56,820
I loved her so much...

485
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,130
How happy I was...

486
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,390
We watched the sunset and she
came back to the hotel with me

487
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,660
I invited her in

488
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,330
I could never have imagined
what happened next

489
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,660
I don't think she was from
Switzerland either

490
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,190
I'm glad to have amused you guys!

491
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,060
That truck driver who gave me a ride
to Bombay was far more sympathetic!

492
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,960
You came back in a truck!?

493
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,900
What did you think?
That I sit on this pillow every day?

494
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,560
I'm pissed off travelling 12 hours
in a truck

495
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,270
Mother, he is Mr. Shankaran.
Art India magazines.

496
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,820
I was telling Siddharth about
my friend who lives in Kasauli

497
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,250
He hosts a painting workshop
every year

498
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,130
And you feel that he must
go there

499
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,300
Absolutely

500
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,660
It'll be a very good experience
for him

501
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,330
Oh, you're here!

502
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,670
You're a strange boy!
you invite me and act surprised when I come.

503
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:09,320
Ma, this is Tara!
Tara Jaiswal. You introduced us before

504
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:35,050
How long will you go around
with that glum face...

505
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,510
Come. Let me introduce you
to these sweet girls

506
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,180
Forget it man.

507
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:42,820
I'm not in the mood

508
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,120
Are you fine?

509
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:52,890
Look... Kristine!

510
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:11,880
Do you like it?

511
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,220
I like them all

512
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,420
It's difficult to say
which one is your best

513
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,960
I haven't painted my best yet

514
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,090
Why not?

515
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,130
You don't seem to have the time?

516
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:37,640
On such a big day in your life
I've to agree to your wish.

517
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:41,750
Tell me, when you will
start my painting?

518
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:42,920
Tomorrow

519
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,590
Wait, I'll be out in a minute.

520
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,090
- No problem

521
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:29,950
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

522
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:44,810
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

523
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:48,640
...in which the colours merge...

524
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,180
...and all the fragrances
blend

525
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:56,250
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

526
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,050
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

527
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:05,660
They all seem favourable to me

528
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:18,870
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

529
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,680
Oh look!

530
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,790
Banks of a river...

531
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:39,220
A bird calls out
to another bird

532
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,870
Look, at the river itself...

533
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:54,370
She flows on to unite
with the sea

534
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:01,880
All these journeys
are part of love's caravan

535
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:12,050
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

536
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,270
Oh how

537
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,770
can I explain...

538
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:02,610
How can I make you understand
what love is!

539
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:10,790
There are no attachments
in love

540
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:17,950
And neither
are there any barriers

541
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:26,300
Love's saga is extraordinary

542
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:35,480
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

543
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,980
...in which all the colours merge...

544
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:42,490
...and all the fragrances
blend

545
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,420
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

546
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:50,320
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

547
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:56,660
They all seem favourable to me

548
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:05,670
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

549
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,090
Greetings, Aunty.

550
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,730
Are you going out, Sameer?

551
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,600
Ya, to Akash's... Why?

552
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:03,900
I'll be back

553
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,240
Mom! What's the matter?

554
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,180
The fact is, Nareshji's daughter
Pooja is coming here

555
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:25,430
And we want the two of you to...

556
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,260
What! Fixing my marriage...!

557
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,100
An arranged marriage!
No, Mom. Not for me

558
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,430
Why not? Your Daddy and I had
an arranged marriage

559
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:40,430
Listen to me. We are not forcing
you to get married

560
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,270
We have known them for years

561
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,780
And we thought we'd turn friendship
into a marriage alliance

562
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:48,620
You don't lose anything by
meeting Pooja, do you?

563
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,990
Okay. But you know my answer.
And that's NO!

564
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,960
Who is it, Sameer?

565
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,120
Er... Sameer, we have something
important to discuss

566
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,990
Nareshji, is that all right?

567
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,020
Anyway, they'll get bored
sitting with us oldies

568
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,190
Are they your friends?

569
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:02,290
Please sit down

570
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,690
This is Akash and this is Sid

571
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,370
Seems like a deep friendship

572
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,540
Either the friendship is deep
or it's a 3-D photograph

573
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,390
Pooja, you do know why
you're here, don't you?

574
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:42,160
Yes. Mom and Dad told me

575
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,730
Look, honestly speaking...

576
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,670
When Mom told me about this...
I felt it wasn't right at first...

577
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,580
...but now... I'm so happy you said no to
this arranged marriage bullshit!

578
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,580
I think marriages shouldn't be
made like this

579
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:07,590
It's so important to love somebody
to get married

580
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:09,050
What do you think?

581
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,420
Yes, absolutely

582
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,260
Why? Are you in love with
someone?

583
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,740
There is this guy in my life

584
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:31,840
But I guess I don't love him
enough so far to marry him

585
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,380
I pretty much feel the same...

586
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,680
...but not about the guy in your life!

587
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:44,490
And then?

588
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,330
Then what!
She went home

589
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:51,660
It's a problem man

590
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:04,170
Please don't tell me you've
fallen for her after all this!

591
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,850
Look, Sameer...

592
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,350
I have no doubt whatsoever
you have fallen in love with her

593
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:14,020
But I'm equally sure that after
3 months...

594
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,380
...you'll be in love with some other
girl

595
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:16,850
No, Akash

596
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,520
I always thought I knew
what love was

597
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,560
I realized today that I was
completely wrong

598
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:25,870
Is that so!

599
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,200
Akash, when Pooja told me about
that guy in her life...

600
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:33,770
For the first time I thought about
all those girls in my life...

601
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,540
I was attracted to all of them...

602
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,000
But I was wrong to think
the attraction was love

603
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,050
And now you love Pooja?

604
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:46,690
Yes. That's it!
I love Pooja

605
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,390
Then tell her

606
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,660
Take my advice. Don't say
anything to anyone

607
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,570
There's no trusting you

608
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:58,230
Today it's Pooja,
tomorrow it'll be some Ahuja!

609
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,090
How did you know it's
my birthday?

610
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,750
Didn't you mention it?

611
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,750
I am so happy today

612
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:28,090
Guess what? Esha called me

613
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,270
She is coming to see me today

614
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,870
My daughter is coming here...

615
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,120
Sid, she remembered it's
my birthday today

616
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:57,950
I'll be seeing her after 5 years!

617
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,290
I've cooked everything myself.
I baked a cake

618
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,800
I'm so happy

619
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,960
Is Esha coming alone or your...

620
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:14,470
Oh no. She told him she's going to
a friend's birthday party...

621
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,640
Because Ajay will never let her
come here

622
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:23,550
Would you like to meet her?

623
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:26,820
It'll make me happy

624
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:38,160
How dare you teach my daughter
to lie? Have you no shame?

625
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:44,340
Thank God I heard Esha
talk to you over the phone

626
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,680
Why don't you stay away from her?

627
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,670
I am her mother!

628
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:52,510
You were her mother but now
Kiran is her mother

629
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,010
It'd be wise of you to understand
this

630
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:58,180
Don't ever try to meet Esha again

631
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,020
Not unless you want me to take
you to court... again

632
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:03,830
You understand what I'm getting at,
don't you?

633
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,240
He tells me I am not Esha's mother!

634
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,410
That Esha is not my daughter!

635
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:56,240
I am her mother...

636
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:02,820
He married again

637
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,410
He destroyed all my dreams.
I said nothing

638
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:11,250
Because I had everything...

639
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,090
I had my Esha

640
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:24,770
I have nothing at all

641
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:34,480
I am nothing. Nothing.

642
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:02,010
You know, crying doesn't suit
you at all

643
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:05,820
What else can I do!

644
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,320
You can come with me

645
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,870
You two must be wondering where
Siddharth has brought you!

646
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,710
No such thing. We'd go
anywhere to eat cake

647
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:20,550
Will you dance with me?

648
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,960
Where?
- Right here there's lot of space, come.

649
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,290
Sid, we've reached your house

650
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:28,960
What?

651
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,130
You're joking, right?

652
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:43,800
Hey Akash, he's serious man!

653
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:46,480
Have you gone mad?

654
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,820
Sid, my knowledge of such
things is a bit sad but...

655
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,950
...this is a but much, isn't it?

656
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:02,920
Is that because she's older?

657
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,660
No. I mean that too

658
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:09,660
Wait a minute! Why are we even
discussing this nonsense?

659
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,340
Because I thought that may be
you guys would understand

660
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:25,510
Hey Sid! Understand what?

661
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,350
You say you love a woman who
is 10 to 15 years older than you...

662
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,860
...has a daughter, had a husband

663
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:38,190
You've told us she has a
drinking problem

664
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,520
What should we understand?
- Just this...

665
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:42,020
I know all this and still
love her

666
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:46,500
But Sid, think about it.
This isn't love, it's insanity

667
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,370
No. This is love

668
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,710
I don't expect her to be mine
or marry me

669
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,380
I don't expect any such thing

670
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,710
Even if she doesn't love me,
it's okay because I...

671
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,220
okay! I get it

672
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,720
Remember, Sameer? Even I had
started off like this

673
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,990
Started what off?
Oh. Of course.

674
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,070
Okay, Sid. If that's what it's about
then I have no objection

675
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,400
In fact she's perfect for you

676
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,070
She's experienced, lives alone.
You visit her everyday

677
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,070
Learn from him, Sameer

678
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,740
Really, Sid. You couldn't have
chosen better...

679
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:36,590
How disgusting can you get!

680
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,960
Here I am telling you I love her and
you make it sound so sick and dirty

681
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,760
We don't have to approve
everything our friends do

682
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:55,600
But there is a line in every
friendship that shouldn't be crossed

683
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:57,240
And you have crossed it today

684
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:06,550
At some point in life everyone
experiences true love

685
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:12,280
Then all the things you said...
about her age and stuff...

686
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:17,990
They don't mean anything.
They all seem trivial

687
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,390
You won't understand this today

688
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,470
But some day you will know...

689
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:29,540
You don't decide to fall in love

690
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:32,280
It just happens

691
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,310
Are you finished?

692
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:51,360
Sameer, are you coming?

693
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,820
I still remember that night

694
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:52,270
I never thought things would go
that far

695
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,770
I couldn't sleep all night

696
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:02,840
I went and met Akash
the next morning

697
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:44,620
These things happen
between friends

698
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:48,420
Let's go meet Sid.
He must be feeling bad too

699
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,600
You're sure to run into him
somewhere

700
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,800
What'll you do? Ignore him?

701
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:03,600
You're coming to meet Sid

702
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,270
Leave me alone, Sameer!

703
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:34,840
I have to see Sid

704
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:36,070
He's gone

705
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,040
Where? - Kasauli

706
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:43,310
They called yesterday to say his
application was accepted. So he...

707
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,620
What is it, Sameer?
Is everything alright?

708
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:54,720
Of course. I should go

709
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:05,070
I didn't realise that things
would never be the same again

710
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:10,380
You went to Kasauli... A week later,
Akash left for Australia

711
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:23,220
Take care of yourself

712
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,920
You remember the name of the man
who'll receive you in Sydney?

713
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:30,250
Mr. Mehta... Relax, Dad.
I remember

714
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,100
Bye. I'll call you from there

715
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,670
I must tell you something
- What's it?

716
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:52,480
I always made fun of your
endless romantic entanglements

717
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:58,050
Never stopped to think how you
must feel

718
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,520
You know I was just kidding,
don't you?

719
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,260
Don't worry about it

720
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:10,330
You weren't the only one who was
kidding

721
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:12,960
You remember Shalini?

722
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,930
I remember Shalini...
And Rohit's punch as well

723
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,070
I knew she was Rohit's fiancee

724
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,370
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you stop me?

725
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,780
I said Hi

726
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:57,580
Where are you going?

727
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:00,920
This flight goes to Sydney

728
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,680
But where are you going?

729
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:07,650
How strange! All three of us
are going to Sydney

730
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:09,360
Three?

731
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,420
Sure. You, me, and this flight

732
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:17,260
You do know you're insane,
don't you?

733
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,950
I'm really sorry about
the other night

734
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:31,410
I was just kidding

735
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:40,480
So what are you...

736
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:45,850
What are you doing in Sydney?

737
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:49,560
Dad has a business there he
wants me to manage...

738
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:53,170
Let's see how long it lasts now.
And you?

739
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:55,470
My uncle lives there

740
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:58,210
My mother's brother.
I'm visiting him

741
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,640
He's nothing like Rohit, is he!

742
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,740
What does he do?

743
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:09,680
Have you been to Sydney before?

744
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,380
Do you always ask so many
questions?

745
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:16,220
Yes. Have you been to Sydney
before?

746
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:17,500
Yes

747
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:20,460
Good. You can show me around

748
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,230
Wait a minute. Don't you know
anybody else there?

749
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:26,300
Of course. There is a Mr. Mehta

750
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,110
And won't it be fun hanging out
with him?

751
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:35,650
I said I'm sorry

752
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:38,610
Okay but I will have to ask
my uncle

753
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:42,380
But he won't refuse.

754
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:43,490
Why?

755
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,520
Because I have bought him a gift!

756
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:20,450
I'm fine but please stop
calling me uncle now

757
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,990
You've grown up which makes us
practically the same age

758
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:35,400
So, is it a business trip?

759
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:39,370
We have an export business and
Dad's exported me here to handle it

760
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,310
Exports? Sounds very boring, man

761
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,350
That's what I think too

762
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,940
Personally, I prefer something more
adventurous...

763
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:46,880
...like wild life photography

764
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,520
You like photography?

765
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:53,860
Mum says the first word I said
wasn't Papa or Mama...

766
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:54,890
It was camera!

767
01:32:59,170 --> 01:32:59,630
I'm Steve

768
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,330
Steve? - Satyadev Mehta

769
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:08,700
I've organized a car for you.
I'll get your trolley

770
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:13,040
Okay Shalini, I'll take your leave.
Bye, Mahesh

771
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:20,340
Here's my card. If you need
anything in Sydney, call me

772
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,050
Well, I'd better leave now.
I'm sure you want to rest

773
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:52,350
I'll send the driver to pick you
up tomorrow

774
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:19,280
Yes, I'll tell Mr. Mehta

775
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:49,300
Dad wants you to send him
a copy of the new contract

776
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,010
You are coming to the meeting
tomorrow, aren't you?

777
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,680
Can you give me our transaction
file?

778
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:59,580
I'd like to know a little more about
them before the meeting

779
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,390
I'll send you the file right away

780
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:08,730
Is there a good restaurant around
here?

781
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:37,050
Being alone in a new city
can be so boring

782
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:39,090
But you aren't alone!

783
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:40,990
Who said I was bored?

784
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,430
Who'd have thought that
someday you

785
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,500
and me would be sitting
here like friends

786
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,130
Especially after all that happened...

787
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:56,900
So how is Rohit?

788
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:00,880
He's fine. I spoke to him
this morning

789
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:05,540
I told him I met you on the flight
and...

790
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:10,950
And he doesn't like you meeting
me! Right?

791
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:18,200
But you're here.
Why?

792
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,730
Akash, you don't know Rohit.

793
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,200
He doesn't like me meeting
any boys

794
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,270
But Rohit is a good guy

795
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:33,080
He has a few faults but then,
don't we all. Me... you...

796
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,010
Faults... and me!

797
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:39,980
So tell me about yourself

798
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,420
What do you want to know?

799
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,690
Of course I have. But not for
more than 2 weeks

800
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:55,030
Then there's another girlfriend...
another 2 weeks...

801
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:56,700
And then another...

802
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:00,840
stop! I understand how your
girlfriend system works

803
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:03,040
What I don't understand is...
why?

804
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:07,810
The fact is, I've seen many of my
friends with their "beloveds"

805
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:10,610
They have everything but love
for each other

806
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,740
That's why I think I am better off
as I am

807
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:16,990
No questions... no answers

808
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:21,190
I don't ask Rohit questions,
nor do I demand answers

809
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:23,960
But he asks questions.
He demands answers

810
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,630
I never said it's always
the girl's fault

811
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:31,670
But relationships just get like that.
Start with joy and end in grief

812
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:36,700
I see! So this is the result of
an end in grief

813
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:39,880
Now I've understood your
2 weeks formula!

814
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,210
No! It's nothing of the sort

815
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:44,920
I have consciously decided not to
fall in love and ruin my life

816
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:49,250
But love isn't about decisions.
It just happens

817
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:50,920
Then I don't let it happen to me

818
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:54,420
Give it some time. I'm sure
it will some day

819
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,590
Why? Are you proposing?

820
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:10,270
How was your day?

821
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:15,610
Akash is nuts

822
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:40,870
Turn it down guys.
It's my wife-to-be

823
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:44,370
How are you?

824
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,380
Hopefully a little less drunk

825
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:51,220
Did you get my message?
Where were you?

826
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:53,380
I met Akash for lunch

827
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:00,880
I told you not to meet him!
Why don't you listen to me?

828
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,390
Are you yelling at me in front
of your friends?

829
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:14,400
I am coming there. It'll take some
time but I will be there

830
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:18,410
As you wish, Rohit. Bye

831
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:28,350
Pooja, I was in the neighbourhood
and I thought...

832
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:32,520
Pooja, if you aren't doing
anything else...

833
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,860
Pooja, I was in the neighbour...

834
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:41,030
Bye mom, I'll call later

835
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:23,910
Fine. And you?

836
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,750
Subodh, this is Sameer.
Sameer, this is Subodh

837
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,090
Are you waiting for someone?

838
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,100
Yes. But it seems like
they won't show up now

839
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:55,500
So tell me... what's the plan
after dinner?

840
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,170
No plan

841
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:00,170
Come on, let's do something

842
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,180
What say, Subodh?

843
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,020
I'm sorry. I've made it a habit
to sleep by 10

844
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:10,020
One night won't change
your habit

845
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:12,700
Come on, pal. Anyway,
it's Sunday tomorrow

846
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:15,860
I know. Thing is I've to wake up at
5 and do Yoga

847
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:19,540
Then some jogging and breakfast
at 8 sharp

848
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:21,870
And since it's Sunday...

849
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,200
...we spend the day at Kumar uncle's
beach house

850
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:27,980
I'll be right back

851
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,680
It's time for his bathroom break,
right?

852
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,680
He isn't that bad

853
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,020
So where are you off to?

854
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:45,190
Let's see...

855
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:50,190
If Time Table doesn't want to
come, may be you can join me

856
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,370
I'm sure I can...

857
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:01,040
If I call you sometime...

858
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:21,460
Wow! What're we celebrating?

859
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:23,290
You don't remember?

860
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:28,470
It was on this day five months ago
that I told you what I felt for you

861
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,880
To Subodh and Pooja!

862
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:51,560
What's the situation like?
- Pretty intense

863
01:42:56,330 --> 01:42:56,960
Really, Mahesh

864
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:02,290
There were such intense scenes
in the film! So moving...

865
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,810
Please cut out the performance

866
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:08,300
And forgive me for taking you
to see such a good film!

867
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,800
You see! That's my biggest problem

868
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,980
I can't bear watching good films

869
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:17,980
Yes. You only like those
wham bang action films

870
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:19,990
Anyway, that's all you can
understand...

871
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,320
...because they don't require you
to use your brains or heart!

872
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,160
You need plenty of brains for
these love stories

873
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:29,660
She sits here shedding tears,
he sits there sighing...

874
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:32,160
...what's all this lovey- dovey
stuff about anyway!

875
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:34,500
You won't understand

876
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:37,500
What're you doing man, let's go

877
01:43:57,230 --> 01:44:00,530
Wonder why
people fall in love

878
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:08,200
Wonder why people
are ready to die for someone

879
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,710
Wonder why
people fall in love

880
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,540
Wonder why people
are ready to die for someone

881
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:24,210
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why...

882
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,380
Wonder why... why... why!

883
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:39,730
Just think about it,
there is only grief in love

884
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:44,730
As for love's cruelty,
it's past counting

885
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:50,240
When in love
your head must remain bowed

886
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,410
Even when in pain
you have to smile

887
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:58,750
Why fill your own life
with poison?

888
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:06,420
Wonder why
people fall in love

889
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:11,920
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why

890
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:17,100
Wonder why why... why...

891
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:28,280
Without love
what's left in life

892
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:36,450
Without love
A person is Ionely

893
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,300
Without love
what's there in life

894
01:45:44,830 --> 01:45:47,960
Without love
A person is Ionely

895
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:51,800
Love brings colour
into your life

896
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:55,640
Love brings beauty
into your life

897
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:59,480
People fall in love
but hide it

898
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:06,980
Wonder why they fear
expressing it openly

899
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:12,480
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why...

900
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:17,490
Wonder why why why!

901
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:08,040
Love is just
needless trouble

902
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:13,220
Love is beautiful
in every aspect

903
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:18,210
We are all better off
far away from love

904
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,220
Love's every form
is the assured truth

905
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:27,900
He that tests love's
waters...

906
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:31,730
...neither drowns nor floats

907
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,740
Wonder why?

908
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:38,070
Everyone but everyone
falls in love

909
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:42,250
Wonder why only you
keep avoiding it

910
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:46,250
Wonder why...

911
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,580
Wonder why...

912
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:54,080
Wonder why why why!

913
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:28,830
Tell me something Shalini

914
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:31,330
Why're you so scared of
sitting on these rides?

915
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,000
I m not scared

916
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:39,000
I think only those who aren't right
in their heads enjoy these rides

917
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:42,340
Interesting excuse

918
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:45,340
You need courage to sit on
these rides! You need guts

919
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,850
But don't worry. There are many
cowards like you around here

920
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:51,350
Look. There's one right there

921
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:57,190
It's not like that at all

922
01:48:57,890 --> 01:49:02,020
If it isn't like that, then get on
that ride with me

923
01:49:07,070 --> 01:49:08,200
Why? No guts?

924
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:10,860
It's getting late

925
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:18,210
I'm going on that ride

926
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:22,220
If you want, you can come with me.
Or sit here and get bored

927
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:31,290
Absolutely no guts

928
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:32,420
Hurry. We can catch this train

929
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,220
Really Shalini! How could you
scare that poor old man!

930
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:10,610
How did it go?

931
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,110
Really well. They like my work

932
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:17,940
And... they want me to
come back

933
01:53:18,990 --> 01:53:19,960
That's great

934
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:21,790
When will you have to go?

935
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:24,790
I've just returned and you're
asking about my leaving

936
01:53:27,670 --> 01:53:28,960
Did you talk to Sameer?

937
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:29,960
No. Why?

938
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:33,640
He came over the morning
you left

939
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,300
He seemed very troubled

940
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:40,310
What did he say?
- Nothing

941
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:52,320
When did you get back?

942
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:57,490
How are you? How's everything?

943
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,160
Great. How are things with you
man?

944
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,160
It's a very long story

945
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:02,660
Let's go up and talk

946
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,970
Okay, so here's the situation

947
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:13,470
You are pretty good friends.
Hang out together

948
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:15,640
But you still haven't told her
how you feel

949
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:18,470
I've tried very hard...

950
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:23,150
But the words just don't come out

951
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,480
Didn't she have a boyfriend?

952
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,150
Yup. She did... but not anymore

953
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:35,160
I don't know what Pooja saw
in him

954
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:38,170
I mean he was sweet
but what a bore!

955
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:43,670
One day I made the mistake of
going for a drive with them

956
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:46,710
See this place...

957
01:54:47,410 --> 01:54:50,040
I met Pooja for the first time
on 15th September right here

958
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:56,710
Exactly 7 days later, we came here
to have ice cream... 22nd September

959
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:01,720
You wouldn't remember the time,
would you?

960
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:05,560
Of course I remember.
It was exactly 5.55

961
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:14,730
That's not all

962
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:18,730
He'd buy her a balloon
everyday

963
01:55:19,110 --> 01:55:19,730
Balloon...?

964
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:25,240
Yes. You know those heart shaped
ones you get at signals

965
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:31,250
It's okay but...
Everyday!

966
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:32,420
One balloon a day!

967
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:39,900
I knew the guy was deranged

968
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:53,740
If you love Pooja so much,
why haven't you told her?

969
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,410
I was afraid...

970
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:02,250
What if Pooja says no?

971
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,250
I'd even lose this friendship
we share now...

972
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:09,090
and be all alone

973
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:16,930
You weren't here.
Nor was Akash

974
01:56:23,470 --> 01:56:24,440
Anyway, you're here now

975
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:27,280
And I feel stronger knowing
that you're here for me

976
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:29,940
I'm always here for you, Sameer

977
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:34,780
Then... shall I tell her today?

978
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:38,280
Tell her

979
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:44,120
Pooja, there's something
I need to tell you

980
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:51,790
I wonder what if the arranging
incident hadn't happened

981
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:57,300
If we hadn't met the way we
did...

982
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:01,470
If I had met you somewhere else,
would we be the same as we are now?

983
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:05,150
And if we weren't the way we are,
how else would we be?

984
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,980
If you thought differently
about me...

985
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:09,310
...if I thought differently about
you, what'd happen?

986
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:15,050
What's happening now?
...What am I saying?

987
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:22,230
Just a lot of ifs!
What's the matter?

988
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:26,400
The matter is just that...

989
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:29,730
I'm falling in love with you

990
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:34,740
I agree that we don't know
each other very well

991
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:45,920
If you trust me at all, believe
that I am telling the truth

992
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:34,560
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

993
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:40,080
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

994
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:47,250
She who loves only me

995
01:58:47,450 --> 01:58:49,750
She must be even ready
to say...

996
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,250
"O listen, you are the one
who has my heart"

997
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:55,260
Oh, where is that girl?

998
01:59:04,970 --> 01:59:09,930
She who lives in your dream
as love's beautiful embodiment...

999
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:12,440
You will find her someday
or other

1000
01:59:12,650 --> 01:59:15,610
Just look here and there

1001
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,620
Let's both go and find her...

1002
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:25,120
This angel, this fairy,
this damsel so dainty...

1003
01:59:25,330 --> 01:59:27,620
...who upon seeing,
you will say

1004
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:30,630
She is right here!

1005
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:09,660
I wonder why
I had this thought...

1006
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:16,000
Could you be the
dream girl?

1007
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:25,680
You have all the graces
that I search for everywhere

1008
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:28,350
I think you are deluded

1009
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:30,850
I wonder what you think I am

1010
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:33,360
I am no angel or fairy
nor any celestial nymph

1011
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,530
Don't have any such
illusions

1012
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:46,040
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

1013
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:51,540
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

1014
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:30,910
Suppose I say to you...

1015
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:36,920
All I think of
is you and only you

1016
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:41,080
You must know
this is what I desire...

1017
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:46,760
...you must be with me,
only with me

1018
02:01:46,970 --> 02:01:49,260
Oh, what have you made me believe!

1019
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:51,770
Oh, how you make my heart beat!

1020
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:54,270
You melt my body and soul...

1021
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:57,270
...reciting this saga of yours

1022
02:02:07,150 --> 02:02:11,950
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

1023
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:14,960
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

1024
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:19,620
Oh, where is that girl?
That girl is here!

1025
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:35,810
Where is that girl?
- That girl is here!

1026
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:06,510
I can't believe that it's already
time for you to leave

1027
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:10,520
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll be back soon

1028
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:12,520
Three months is not soon

1029
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:15,180
And that's this time

1030
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:19,020
You don't know how long
you'll be gone next time

1031
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:26,360
Siddharth... have you thought about
marriage?

1032
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:27,190
Mom!

1033
02:03:29,070 --> 02:03:30,040
What Mom!

1034
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:35,870
Some other time, okay?
- But why? Why not now?

1035
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:44,380
It's just... forget it, Mom.
You won't understand

1036
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:50,210
I'm your mother! If I can't
understand you, who else will?

1037
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:54,380
Is there someone you like?

1038
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,730
Sid, what's the matter?

1039
02:04:02,770 --> 02:04:04,400
You've never hidden anything
from me

1040
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:07,070
Yes, Ma. But there are some things
that you just can't tell somebody

1041
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,570
Yes there are...

1042
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:12,570
But I can see there's something
eating away at you inside

1043
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:15,070
Will you keep it bottled up inside
all your life?

1044
02:04:22,450 --> 02:04:24,080
Ma, I'm telling you
you won't understand!

1045
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,080
Why won't I understand?

1046
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,930
Try telling me

1047
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:35,260
What is this thing that I don't
have the right to know?

1048
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:40,260
What's the matter?

1049
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:53,620
That Tara Jaiswal?

1050
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:58,520
I've met her so many times...
But... she...

1051
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:02,350
When did this start?

1052
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:05,030
I don't know when...

1053
02:05:07,070 --> 02:05:08,690
I won't let you ruin your life!

1054
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:11,700
Have you any inkling of what
you are saying?

1055
02:05:12,910 --> 02:05:14,870
My son has fallen in love with
a woman who...

1056
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:17,200
You were right I wouldn't
understand

1057
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:21,370
And what has she told you,
that she loves you?

1058
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:24,380
She must've seduced you with her
sad stories

1059
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,140
What did she say to you?
- She said nothing!

1060
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:33,660
She doesn't even know that I...

1061
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,830
Your mother is absolutely right,
Siddharth

1062
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:50,830
Don't ruin your life over me. And the
little peace I have left in my life...

1063
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:53,840
Please don't take it away
from me

1064
02:06:13,970 --> 02:06:16,940
Go away! - Please listen to me

1065
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:18,110
I don't want to hear anything

1066
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:22,440
Have I ever made you feel
that I love you...

1067
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:24,270
...or want a relationship
with you?

1068
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:26,450
No

1069
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:28,620
Then what made you think...

1070
02:06:29,150 --> 02:06:30,280
...that you and I could...

1071
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:32,120
...have any such relationship?

1072
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:37,620
This is the problem with your
generation

1073
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:43,790
You all think anything goes.
But that's not so, Siddharth

1074
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,800
Why just me?

1075
02:06:49,670 --> 02:06:50,970
You have also caused your mother
a lot of pain

1076
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:54,300
Please sit down

1077
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:27,840
I'm so sorry that I caused you
and my mother such pain

1078
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:34,180
I'm sorry you had to hear
all this because of me

1079
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,690
But it's true that I love you

1080
02:07:53,530 --> 02:07:56,830
It's also true that I never
wanted you to know it

1081
02:07:59,010 --> 02:08:00,470
Because I knew that you...

1082
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:03,310
...would never be able to understand

1083
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:10,220
I just want to see you happy

1084
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:20,050
And if knowing the truth
has caused you pain today...

1085
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:26,060
All I can say is, that wasn't
my intention

1086
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:41,570
Sid, please leave now

1087
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:16,880
After the workshop...

1088
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:22,060
I think I'll go stay at uncle's
farm house for a while

1089
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:25,730
It's a good place to paint

1090
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:37,230
Will you come with me?

1091
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:42,740
I don't want to go without you

1092
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:21,940
Just a minute...

1093
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:19,370
You look very lovely

1094
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,380
So, why are we here?

1095
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:32,550
To prove to you that a thing called
love does exist in this world

1096
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,050
Don't you ever give up?

1097
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:39,890
Shut up and lets go in

1098
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:10,250
Why are we here?
- To watch an opera

1099
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:12,420
Yes, but why?

1100
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:15,260
You'll know when the time comes

1101
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:24,990
The girl's name is Cressida
and the boy is Troilus

1102
02:13:26,530 --> 02:13:28,330
They love each other very much

1103
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:49,020
But Troilus must go now

1104
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:52,360
He has to go to war for his country

1105
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:56,700
Cressida is afraid something may
happen to him

1106
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:01,030
Troilus is telling her
nothing will happen to him

1107
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:27,950
This is the spirit of Troilus...
standing at heaven's gate

1108
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:31,130
But he doesn't want to go inside

1109
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:35,630
He is asking God for one day

1110
02:15:38,170 --> 02:15:39,960
He wants to meet Cressida for
one last time

1111
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:45,300
And tell her how much he loves her

1112
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:50,310
If he is given one day...

1113
02:15:51,850 --> 02:15:53,980
He is willing to die a thousand
deaths

1114
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:03,650
Shut your eyes, Akash

1115
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:10,170
Think...

1116
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:12,170
Who is it...

1117
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:17,330
...to spend that one day with, you
are willing to die a thousand deaths

1118
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:21,010
Who is it, Akash?

1119
02:17:58,410 --> 02:17:59,710
No so easily!

1120
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:03,540
You still haven't told me
who you saw

1121
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:07,720
You seem quite sure that I
saw someone?

1122
02:18:08,420 --> 02:18:10,220
Yes. Because today for
the first time...

1123
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:12,720
...you're talking less
and thinking more!

1124
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:25,290
Then listen

1125
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:28,300
I saw her...

1126
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:31,300
And I felt...

1127
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:34,140
...perhaps this is what
they call love

1128
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:42,810
I wanted to touch her...

1129
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:46,490
...hold her in my arms...

1130
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:52,490
I saw such innocence
in her eyes...

1131
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,490
...like I see in your eyes now

1132
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:02,330
Her voice...

1133
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:04,330
...had the kind of magic
your voice has

1134
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:10,340
I can still feel the fragrance
of her breath...

1135
02:19:10,550 --> 02:19:12,010
...like I can feel
in your breath now

1136
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:14,980
Who was she?

1137
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,520
That fat opera singer!

1138
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:51,880
Shalini, come inside... at once!

1139
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:48,100
I think the two of you should
talk alone

1140
02:20:57,590 --> 02:21:00,060
Where had you gone?
- To the opera

1141
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:03,120
With Akash!

1142
02:21:04,990 --> 02:21:07,290
How many times have I told you
not to meet him!

1143
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:13,970
Rohit, will you keep telling me
all my life...

1144
02:21:14,170 --> 02:21:15,640
...who I should or should not meet!

1145
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:19,630
Yes. I will

1146
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:23,640
And you will never see Akash
again. You got that?

1147
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:33,310
Rohit, I need some time to think
and you need it too

1148
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:57,200
Shalini had called.
She said it's important

1149
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:11,390
Hi, Rohit. It's Akash

1150
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:15,220
Is Shalini there? She had called

1151
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:19,560
I know. We are going back...
to get married

1152
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:26,240
Can I speak to Shalini?

1153
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:55,670
That's good news

1154
02:23:58,300 --> 02:23:59,930
Akash, we are going back tomorrow

1155
02:24:01,310 --> 02:24:02,770
Can you come for dinner tonight?

1156
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:07,940
I don't know. Bye

1157
02:24:25,330 --> 02:24:26,460
Hey, Akash! We thought you
weren't going to make it

1158
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:11,510
They're beautiful. Thanks

1159
02:25:13,210 --> 02:25:13,900
What will you drink?

1160
02:25:15,650 --> 02:25:18,910
We can drink later. Let's eat first.
I'm starving

1161
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:48,710
Shalini, have you told
Mahesh Uncle...

1162
02:25:48,910 --> 02:25:50,380
...how you and Akash met?

1163
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:54,940
No?

1164
02:25:57,720 --> 02:25:58,880
Really, Mahesh Uncle...

1165
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:01,720
I don't know what you'd have
done if you were there

1166
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:03,050
What happened?

1167
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:06,560
It was at my graduation
party

1168
02:26:07,230 --> 02:26:07,890
Shalini was with me

1169
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:10,160
Perhaps Akash didn't know
that...

1170
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:21,740
Sorry for the punch

1171
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:27,580
No, Rohit. It was my fault

1172
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:33,590
But to tell you the truth,
I think I was lucky

1173
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:35,410
What do you mean?

1174
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,320
I mean, if Shalini was with me...

1175
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:42,430
...and someone had acted fresh...

1176
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:45,430
I'd have killed him

1177
02:26:58,950 --> 02:26:59,440
That is...

1178
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:02,280
If Shalini was with you

1179
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:35,780
Hey, wait...

1180
02:27:56,770 --> 02:27:59,330
You're coming to our wedding,
aren't you?

1181
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:03,180
No, I can't make it. There's a lot
of work to be done

1182
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:06,510
Some friend you are!

1183
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:10,680
Anyway, don't forget to call us to
your wedding

1184
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:12,350
We'll definitely be there

1185
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:15,020
I'm not going to get married

1186
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:16,350
Why?

1187
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:21,360
It's necessary to love someone
to get married

1188
02:28:22,230 --> 02:28:23,700
And I believe...

1189
02:28:24,070 --> 02:28:25,870
...this thing called love doesn't
exist in the world

1190
02:28:28,470 --> 02:28:30,170
Shalini and I love each other

1191
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:32,210
That's why we're getting married.
Isn't that so, Shalini?

1192
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:40,210
You both shouldn't ask each other
this question. Ask yourself

1193
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:47,050
I better go

1194
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:22,250
You left your jacket with me
the other night

1195
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:41,100
Some day I want to tell you why
I am marrying Rohit

1196
02:29:41,310 --> 02:29:45,270
Why? What's the need to tell me?

1197
02:29:47,950 --> 02:29:48,780
I need to...

1198
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:51,780
Because we both know...

1199
02:29:54,890 --> 02:29:56,790
...that night at the opera,
when you shut your eyes...

1200
02:29:58,130 --> 02:30:00,620
...it wasn't the fat opera singer
you saw

1201
02:30:27,030 --> 02:30:33,660
Loneliness

1202
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:41,170
This Ioneliness...

1203
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:51,350
Why have I stumbled on
the path of love

1204
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:56,180
All my dreams lie shattered
A sense of gloom lies heavy

1205
02:30:56,390 --> 02:31:00,850
Every joy is be numbed

1206
02:31:01,230 --> 02:31:06,290
My very life is lost

1207
02:31:06,570 --> 02:31:11,270
I am being punished
for loving you

1208
02:31:11,470 --> 02:31:16,340
Loneliness...

1209
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:21,080
Loneliness stretches over
miles and miles

1210
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:16,090
In my dream I saw
a hand in my hand

1211
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:26,270
Now I am blinded by the
shards of a shattered dream

1212
02:32:40,490 --> 02:32:44,950
Someone was here yesterday

1213
02:32:45,170 --> 02:32:50,260
but today there is no one

1214
02:32:50,670 --> 02:32:55,470
Like a cobra's venomous hiss
it envelopes my very breath...

1215
02:32:55,680 --> 02:33:00,340
...this Ioneliness

1216
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:04,910
has brought tears to my eyes

1217
02:33:54,900 --> 02:34:00,360
Oh how could my hope for
something be so futile

1218
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:10,650
I've embarked on a journey
to which there is no destination

1219
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:28,730
Where should I go?

1220
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:34,200
To whom shall I explain?

1221
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,730
What I had wanted...

1222
02:34:36,940 --> 02:34:39,240
And why I ended up with...

1223
02:34:39,450 --> 02:34:44,410
...this Ioneliness

1224
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:48,750
Loneliness
deeply dark as the night

1225
02:34:59,270 --> 02:35:04,100
Why have I stumbled on
the path of love

1226
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:08,740
All my dreams lie shattered
A sense of gloom lies heavy

1227
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:13,610
Every joy is be numbed

1228
02:35:13,810 --> 02:35:19,120
My very life is lost

1229
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:23,950
I am being punished
for loving you

1230
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:28,820
Loneliness...

1231
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:33,630
Loneliness stretches over
miles and miles

1232
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:22,110
Hello, Aunty. Is Sameer home?

1233
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:23,180
Who is this?

1234
02:36:27,090 --> 02:36:30,020
You want to talk to Sameer
and you've called Siddharth!

1235
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:31,850
How are you?

1236
02:36:32,530 --> 02:36:34,360
I... I'm okay, Aunty

1237
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:38,860
He's gone to Kasauli. Give me
your number. I'll give it to him

1238
02:36:40,530 --> 02:36:42,530
No, it's okay.
I'll call him

1239
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:37,350
How are you, son?

1240
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:42,050
I'm okay, Dad

1241
02:37:44,530 --> 02:37:47,830
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

1242
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:50,190
No, it's nothing like that

1243
02:37:51,610 --> 02:37:52,940
Been working all day...

1244
02:37:53,310 --> 02:37:54,100
I'm tired, that's all

1245
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:08,050
Come back home, Akash

1246
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:37,820
What's wrong, Akash?

1247
02:38:40,090 --> 02:38:41,990
I've never seen you like this
before

1248
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:44,250
I'm in love, Dad

1249
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:50,120
So what's the problem?

1250
02:38:51,660 --> 02:38:53,150
She is marrying somebody else

1251
02:38:57,370 --> 02:38:59,840
Have you told her you love her?

1252
02:39:01,980 --> 02:39:02,460
No

1253
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:05,410
Does she love you?

1254
02:39:09,850 --> 02:39:10,610
Yes, she does

1255
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:14,480
Has she told you?

1256
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:25,190
Akash, you must tell her
how you feel

1257
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:28,300
No

1258
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:29,700
Why not?

1259
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:34,540
She is marrying somebody else

1260
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:42,880
There are many things in this world
that are beyond our understanding

1261
02:39:44,050 --> 02:39:45,880
When a person decides something...

1262
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:50,220
...there must be a reason for that
decision

1263
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:56,590
You say that the girl loves you
but is marrying someone else

1264
02:39:57,930 --> 02:40:02,230
Have you tried to find out
why she's doing it?

1265
02:40:04,710 --> 02:40:06,800
What's the reason for her decision?

1266
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:26,930
How's Shalini?

1267
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:29,490
She isn't happy

1268
02:40:31,630 --> 02:40:32,600
And how could she be?

1269
02:40:33,770 --> 02:40:36,740
She is marrying Rohit
but loves you

1270
02:40:40,910 --> 02:40:42,570
Did she tell you that?
- No

1271
02:40:44,910 --> 02:40:46,640
Did you ever tell me you love her?

1272
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:53,880
Then why's she getting married?

1273
02:40:56,690 --> 02:40:59,180
Rohit's father and Shalini's father
were business partners

1274
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:06,430
Shalini was six when her parents
were killed in a car accident

1275
02:41:08,140 --> 02:41:13,040
I was her only relative but
I wasn't able to support her

1276
02:41:16,140 --> 02:41:17,370
Rohit's parents took her in...

1277
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:18,140
...not only into their home

1278
02:41:18,350 --> 02:41:20,280
but their hearts and their life

1279
02:41:21,550 --> 02:41:23,040
They've done a lot for her

1280
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:28,150
If they want her to marry Rohit,
Shalini can't refuse

1281
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:31,920
What else can she do?

1282
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:37,260
On one hand are the people who've
given her the life she's living

1283
02:41:38,770 --> 02:41:39,700
On the other hand is a man...

1284
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:42,600
She doesn't even know if he loves
her or not

1285
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:48,440
Akash, what are you doing man!
Go and tell her you love her

1286
02:41:52,110 --> 02:41:54,080
Akash, only you know what
you have to do

1287
02:41:55,580 --> 02:41:57,710
Just know this. Tonight is
the Sangeet function...

1288
02:41:59,050 --> 02:42:00,250
...and tomorrow the wedding

1289
02:42:02,530 --> 02:42:05,390
Whatever your decision,
you must make it today

1290
02:44:20,290 --> 02:44:21,350
Will you marry me?

1291
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:33,470
Not even if I tell you that
I love you?

1292
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:15,440
Shalini...

1293
02:45:17,450 --> 02:45:19,510
I love you and only you

1294
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:23,080
My every breath...

1295
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:25,850
...every heartbeat...

1296
02:45:27,630 --> 02:45:30,220
...every moment,
is for you, Shalini

1297
02:45:33,070 --> 02:45:38,230
I'm sure that I was born
so that I could love you

1298
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:42,370
And you were born to become mine

1299
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,040
You are mine, Shalini

1300
02:45:46,110 --> 02:45:47,880
And if you ask your heart...

1301
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:52,110
...you will know that I speak
the truth

1302
02:45:59,090 --> 02:46:01,720
What's going on! Who is this boy?

1303
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:02,890
I'll tell you

1304
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:07,800
He is Akash Malhotra,
A.K. Malhotra's son...

1305
02:46:08,470 --> 02:46:10,730
...who's been after Shalini,
wagging his tail

1306
02:46:11,710 --> 02:46:15,400
I hit him once but I guess
it wasn't enough, huh?

1307
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:17,600
I won't leave you today!

1308
02:46:17,810 --> 02:46:23,050
You will do no such thing, Rohit.
I want to speak to Shalini first

1309
02:46:52,350 --> 02:46:55,110
No, Rohit! You wait here.
- But Dad! This is my life...

1310
02:48:13,900 --> 02:48:17,560
Mahesh, I feel very hurt today

1311
02:48:18,740 --> 02:48:21,430
I always thought that Shalini was
my daughter

1312
02:48:22,340 --> 02:48:25,370
But today I feel that she has
never thought of us as her own

1313
02:48:27,610 --> 02:48:30,510
She wants to repay her debt to us
by marrying Rohit

1314
02:48:33,050 --> 02:48:33,540
All right

1315
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:39,950
Shalini, you must repay us

1316
02:48:41,690 --> 02:48:45,390
For looking after you from
childhood till now... you owe us

1317
02:48:46,230 --> 02:48:49,060
For giving you whatever you
asked for... you owe us

1318
02:48:50,330 --> 02:48:53,270
For shielding you from
even a hint of trouble...

1319
02:48:53,370 --> 02:48:54,200
...you owe us

1320
02:48:56,270 --> 02:49:00,440
Now if you want to repay all that
you owe us... see us happy...

1321
02:49:03,410 --> 02:49:04,940
Then marry Akash

1322
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:13,280
Can you do this much for me?

1323
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:34,070
Come...

1324
02:49:45,420 --> 02:49:49,520
Take care of her.
She is my daughter

1325
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:25,820
Just a minute, Dad

1326
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,960
You can't do this! Mom, why
aren't you saying anything?

1327
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:33,500
Let her go, Rohit

1328
02:50:36,810 --> 02:50:40,000
You care about Shalini's happiness
but don't give a damn about mine!

1329
02:50:40,310 --> 02:50:44,770
Rohit, if Shalini is not happy
being with you...

1330
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:46,910
...how can you ever be happy?

1331
02:50:49,050 --> 02:50:50,210
This can't happen to me!

1332
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:55,120
I won't allow this!

1333
02:50:58,530 --> 02:50:59,020
What are you doing?

1334
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,020
I love Akash

1335
02:51:57,090 --> 02:51:58,320
All his life he said...

1336
02:51:58,620 --> 02:52:00,320
I won't say "I love you" to anyone

1337
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:01,750
And when he had to say it...

1338
02:52:02,090 --> 02:52:04,960
It was at someone's wedding
in front of 300 people!

1339
02:52:09,270 --> 02:52:10,320
Did you call him?

1340
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:14,970
What did he say?

1341
02:52:18,010 --> 02:52:19,000
He wasn't home

1342
02:52:24,680 --> 02:52:26,410
I told you he won't come

1343
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:21,790
Can I talk to Sid?

1344
02:54:43,150 --> 02:54:43,920
How are you?

1345
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:47,520
Fine. How are you?

1346
02:54:54,230 --> 02:54:55,390
Forgive me

1347
02:54:58,340 --> 02:54:59,860
I must apologise too

1348
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:04,940
Some other time.
It's my turn today

1349
02:55:07,410 --> 02:55:08,670
You haven't changed
at all

1350
02:55:09,510 --> 02:55:13,450
Ya. Anyway, it's hard to improve
on perfection

1351
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:21,120
Where are you? When can we meet?

1352
02:55:22,590 --> 02:55:26,190
Today. Now. This very moment

1353
02:57:04,530 --> 02:57:08,660
Now... there's no pain...
nor any fear

1354
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:14,630
I feel good

1355
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:18,030
It's peaceful here

1356
02:57:22,650 --> 02:57:24,780
You're a good boy, Siddharth

1357
02:57:28,820 --> 02:57:30,520
You always stood by me

1358
02:57:35,190 --> 02:57:36,850
You want me to be happy,
don't you...

1359
02:57:40,770 --> 02:57:41,930
Then... you be happy

1360
02:57:44,770 --> 02:57:45,530
You will, won't you?

1361
02:57:45,910 --> 02:57:46,460
I will

1362
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:58,850
Life is so strange

1363
02:58:01,090 --> 02:58:02,490
Some relationships...

1364
02:58:05,690 --> 02:58:07,320
...don't have any name

1365
02:58:14,130 --> 02:58:16,160
You and I will always...

1366
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:15,710
Hey Sid, look at your ship

1367
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:19,510
It was so small 2 years ago.
Look how much it's grown

1368
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:25,790
If you guys wanted to be by
yourselves, you should've told us

1369
03:00:29,030 --> 03:00:31,760
See! I'm getting told off because
of you

1370
03:00:31,970 --> 03:00:32,960
I've been telling you, let's go

1371
03:00:33,240 --> 03:00:33,730
What?

1372
03:00:34,410 --> 03:00:35,300
Come on

1373
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:04,400
Come on man

1374
03:03:04,301 --> 03:04:58,401
