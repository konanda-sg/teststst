1
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,837
Manu!

2
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,754
You goddamned piece of shit!
The entire building's shaking!

3
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:31,504
Sorry, Auntie. I'm done now.
That was the last one.

4
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:35,212
Even my warning was
the last one! Watch it!

5
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:36,754
Why bother sweating it out!

6
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,337
Nothing is going to come out of it anyway.

7
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:42,004
Don't say that, man.
I'm training my ass off.

8
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,129
- I'm going to kill it this time.
- Yeah, whatever.

9
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,420
You've been saying that
for the last two years.

10
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,712
Sandy has opened two more gyms...

11
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,754
and we're still stuck at one.

12
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,254
What are you staring at? Help me!

13
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:59,087
You're such a jinx, Jomo!
Always such a pessimist!

14
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,795
Wait and watch.
Our gym's going to dazzle soon.

15
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:04,004
- "MANU MUNJAL: G.O.A.T 2019!"
- Lift it.

16
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:07,212
Then, all Sandy's clients
will be lining up over here.

17
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:09,379
Guys, that Zumba teacher is on her way.

18
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,212
We need to make space for her.

19
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,587
So, do me a favor
and help me out here.

20
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,212
Screw Zumba.
My clients shouldn't get disturbed.

21
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,629
What clients?

22
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:20,504
Bro, we need more business
to keep this gym running.

23
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,004
Besides, it'll be great to have
some pretty girls in here, right?

24
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,271
Let some eye candy in,
let the good vibes flow.

25
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:27,295
I need to run.

26
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,504
Where to, bro?

27
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,438
- You skipped your planks!
- I'll do them tomorrow.

28
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:31,462
What the hell, Manu!

29
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,045
Poor guy's family sucks
the life out of him.

30
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:40,670
Catch me if you can!

31
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,920
Babbu! You'll hurt yourself! Sit quietly!

32
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:46,837
I'm on a keto diet.
Spare me, for God's sake.

33
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,254
It's your brother-in-law's birthday.
Stop fussing and eat.

34
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,879
They're stuffed with paneer
and packed with protein.

35
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:54,379
Very healthy bhaturas!

36
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,920
These sacks of flour
have 470 calories each.

37
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:58,670
Will you do burpees on my behalf?

38
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,087
Will you lift some
responsibility for a change?

39
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,587
You do remember that
we run a business, right...

40
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:09,129
where your father slogs his ass all day!

41
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:11,879
Papa... I'm a certified fitness provider.

42
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,670
Please look up JustDial.

43
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,480
We're listed among
the Top 10 gyms in Chandigarh.

44
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:17,170
You mean in Sector 35, right?

45
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:20,129
Yeah, so what? Sector 35 is pretty huge.

46
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,712
Really? Tell me,
don't your customers pay you?

47
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,879
You haven't given me a penny 'til date!

48
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,545
I'll return your money.

49
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,295
Once I win the G.O.A.T
national level competition,

50
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,004
sponsors are going to line up.

51
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,129
I'll pay every rupee back.
Don't you worry.

52
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:37,712
It's you who needs to worry, son.
I'm giving you an ultimatum.

53
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:42,212
Either run the family business
or return my money.

54
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,920
It's high time you settled down.
I need a break too.

55
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,962
What do you need a break for?

56
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:52,337
To visit the Vaishno Devi temple?

57
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:57,837
I know who's been roasting your kebabs!

58
00:04:58,087 --> 00:04:59,087
You're impossible!

59
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:02,045
Must you twist everything
into a Hindu-Muslim issue?

60
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:03,629
Stick to the topic!

61
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,129
Hello, Papa. How are you, Manu?

62
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,879
The poor motherless boy has
been toiling day and night!

63
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,920
He's trying to stand on his own feet!

64
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:14,545
Can't you be supportive?

65
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,795
And what about me?

66
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,587
Who is supporting me?

67
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,629
I'm a widower too, after all.

68
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:21,837
So am I.

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,420
My needs are different from yours, Papa.

70
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,087
Hey, shut up!

71
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,087
Bad manners!

72
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,370
Don't discuss such obscenities
in front of the children!

73
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,004
Listen, son.

74
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,129
Goat, Cat, Dog, or Lion,
be whatever you want to be...

75
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:35,212
but be quick!

76
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,879
Earn lots of money,
and throw it in your father's face.

77
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,004
Bhatura?

78
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,212
<i>Manu Munjal is on stage now.</i>

79
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:46,670
<i>He looks really determined today.</i>

80
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,087
<i>Yes!</i>

81
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,295
<i>Oh, no! Manu Munjal has lost again!
So near, yet so far!</i>

82
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,337
<i>This year's G.O.A.T champion
is Sandy yet again!</i>

83
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,212
Hey, fatty. Did you speak to Nikita?

84
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,629
Nikita who?

85
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:04,712
That girl from Bharat Matrimony.

86
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,004
I had shown you her profile.

87
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,379
Oh, that one.

88
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,050
- Why didn't you call her?
- I didn't have time.

89
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,670
Oh, really?

90
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,879
You've turned 30,
and you still didn't have time?!

91
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,170
Nope.

92
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,837
- Give me your password.
- Why?

93
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,004
I want to check if you deleted her number.

94
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,337
Don't you dare snoop into my phone!
Stop trying to get me married!

95
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:27,379
I'll find myself a girl.

96
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,379
I want to make it big first.

97
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:31,379
Enough is enough!

98
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,837
You're already big as a bull!
How much bigger do you want to get?

99
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,962
Look, Manu.

100
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,587
You wasted three years
on Mr. Sharma's daughter.

101
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,587
She strutted off to Canada
leaving you high and dry.

102
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,587
When are you going
to get on with your life?

103
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,712
- Move on, man!
- Fatty.

104
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:49,795
There's no other problem, right?

105
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,420
You're interested in girls, right?

106
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:57,045
I've had it!

107
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,420
Where is my amino supplement, man?

108
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,920
Listen up, aminohead!

109
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,712
Staring at these musclemen all
day has messed up your wiring!

110
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:08,795
Put up photos of some hot actresses.

111
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,587
- Like, Kiara Advani, Disha Patani!
- Not interested!

112
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,212
- Now, get out. Come on.
- Why?

113
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:16,212
- We're saying this out of concern.
- And I'm saying, get out of my room!

114
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:19,462
- Manu, just listen to me.
- Do you want me to kick you out?

115
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:21,629
- You'll kick out your sisters?!
- Get out!

116
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,712
- What the hell!
- You guys are impossible!

117
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:25,712
We'll be back!

118
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,087
<i>O pretty lass!</i>

119
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:15,170
<i>O pretty lass!</i>

120
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,129
<i>O pretty lass!</i>

121
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:30,962
<i>O pretty lass!</i>

122
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,504
You son of a witch!

123
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,295
Curse you and your family!

124
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,712
You're all going to rot in hell!

125
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,337
I'm calling the cops!

126
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:26,837
Sorry about that.

127
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:29,212
Actually, it's the auntie
from downstairs.

128
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,004
She's old.

129
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,545
When the weights fall, she also falls.

130
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,754
And then, she just gives us
some tough love.

131
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,670
I'm Maanvi.

132
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:40,837
Maanvi Brar.

133
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,337
I'm supposed to take Zumba classes here.

134
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,587
Licensed Zumba instructor.

135
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,337
Jumba teacher?

136
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,170
Zumba.

137
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Welcome.

138
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,254
Hi, Maanvi. Sorry. We got a bit late.

139
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,629
- This is Riz, and this is Jomo.
- Hi.

140
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:58,962
Maanvi.

141
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:00,379
Have you guys met already?

142
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:01,712
Yes.

143
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,920
He's our weight-lifting champ.
Our third partner and brother.

144
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,295
Our rock... Manu Munjal.

145
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,879
'Sup? Myself Manvinder.

146
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,170
Hi.

147
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,920
Can I have a look at the space?

148
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,170
Yes. Please come.

149
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,129
Manu, you will come inside?

150
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,920
- Why are you suddenly talking in English?
- Screw that.

151
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,942
We need to lock T-shirt designs
for the coach's birthday party.

152
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:54,337
Don't worry, bro.
Let Chandigarh groove to the Zumba beat.

153
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,212
Five, six, seven, eight!

154
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,212
Up and down!

155
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,087
Stretch!

156
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,587
Right! Left! Right! Left!

157
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:08,170
<i>In every city, they're asking,
"Who's that girl?"</i>

158
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,212
<i>You knock me out with every hip swirl.</i>

159
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
What the heck, bro!

160
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:24,170
<i>In every city, they're asking,
"Who's that girl?"</i>

161
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:28,212
<i>You knock me out with every hip swirl.</i>

162
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,670
<i>Lookin' hella bomb.</i>

163
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:35,629
<i>You're like an Ed Sheeran song.</i>

164
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:38,754
<i>When you Zumba to the beat.</i>

165
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,254
Come on, once more!

166
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,420
<i>When you Zumba to the beat.</i>

167
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,420
Maanvi, please come.

168
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:59,212
<i>O pretty lass!
Who's thinking of you?</i>

169
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:03,295
<i>All the men in town
Have been married off.</i>

170
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:07,545
<i>The geezers in this place
Can't take care of you.</i>

171
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,129
<i>Your relatives are crooks
Who'll take care of you?</i>

172
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,313
<i>Everybody's grooving
To the sound of your beat.</i>

173
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:24,212
Can we just take another opinion?
Manvinder!

174
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:32,254
<i>Everybody's grooving
To the sound of your beat.</i>

175
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,254
<i>One month's calories
Being burned in a week.</i>

176
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:40,254
<i>Your face has them forgetting how to eat.</i>

177
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,212
<i>They're all on duty
In the service of your beauty.</i>

178
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:47,920
<i>When you bling it up, hottie.</i>

179
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:51,712
<i>You dazzle like an Audi.</i>

180
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:56,879
<i>Yeah, when you Zumba to the beat.</i>

181
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,712
<i>When you Zumba to the beat.</i>

182
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,545
He got engaged already.
It's just been a month.

183
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:30,129
Can you believe it?

184
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:31,545
Screw him.

185
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:34,087
He didn't deserve you.
You dodged a bullet.

186
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:38,337
At this rate, I'll be alone all my life.

187
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,295
Hey! Look at yourself, Maanvi!

188
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,379
You're bloody gorgeous.
You'll have guys lining up for you.

189
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,254
Don't worry, bub.

190
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:49,170
Come on. Let's go for it.

191
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,045
Cheers to moving on!

192
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:00,587
<i>Hi, Papa!</i>

193
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,004
How are you?

194
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:03,337
<i>I'm great.</i>

195
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:05,420
<i>Zumba classes have begun in full swing.</i>

196
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:08,504
<i>I got my training
certificate as well. Finally.</i>

197
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,462
Oh, good. I'm so happy for you.

198
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:13,795
<i>Thank you.</i>

199
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,087
But sweetheart,
do you have to do this job? I mean...

200
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,420
<i>is there a money crunch?</i>

201
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:20,712
Papa, please.

202
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,837
It's not about money.

203
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:25,087
I need to get out of the house, right?

204
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,920
I can't be in my shell
for the rest of my life.

205
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Fine.

206
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,295
Do what makes you happy.

207
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:34,212
By the way...

208
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,962
we're coming to Chandigarh next month.

209
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:38,920
Deepa's getting married.

210
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,295
That's great news!

211
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,920
And you're telling me now?!
I could have gone shopping and all.

212
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:46,712
<i>Sorry, am I...</i>

213
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,545
am I even invited?

214
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:49,920
Of course, you are!

215
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:52,837
In fact, your uncle said
that he'll send you a card.

216
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:55,938
Ma doesn't want me to come, right?

217
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,962
No, in fact, she asked me
to call and tell you.

218
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:00,087
She's right here.

219
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,629
Hey, listen. Let's meet soon.

220
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,170
We have tons to catch up on. Alright?

221
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,837
<i>You'd better be free, okay?</i>

222
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah, Papa.

223
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:09,670
<i>- Okay?</i>
- I love you.

224
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:11,629
Love you.

225
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,754
Way to go, man!

226
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,754
- Hey, Sandy!
- Well done!

227
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,545
You didn't have to do this.

228
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:37,545
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, COACH

229
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:39,295
Coach.

230
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:42,254
Come on, Sandy.
You don't need my blessings.

231
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,337
God's always been kind to you.

232
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,170
Where's our other warrior prince?
Come here.

233
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:50,337
Open your mouth.

234
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:53,587
- Wow, Manu!
- Congrats, man!

235
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,295
You had cake!

236
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,379
Now no more chocolate.

237
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,962
You've got to win this time!
Focus on yourself!

238
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,254
That's my boy!

239
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,545
Alright, then.

240
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:06,397
- Let's see what you've got!
- Let's go!

241
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,629
Come on!

242
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,170
Come on!

243
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,379
Come on, Sandy!

244
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:15,962
Come on!

245
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,087
Come on!

246
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:20,504
Come on!

247
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,129
Yes!

248
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,504
Sandy, come on!

249
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:43,004
Manu! Come on, pull hard!

250
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,004
Come on, Manu!

251
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:02,795
Come on, move!

252
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:09,045
Come on, keep pulling! Move!

253
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,587
You can do it, Manu!

254
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:24,295
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

255
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:25,504
And he bites the dust again!

256
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,379
Well done, bro!

257
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:32,379
- My roaring tiger!
- Greetings.

258
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,545
God bless you, my boy!

259
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:39,962
- Keep making us proud.
- Yes, coach.

260
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,795
- That was awesome!
- Wow, bro!

261
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,545
Yo, loser! There are still five-six
weeks to go! Practice harder!

262
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:51,829
Anyway, you ought to be
the runner-up this time as well!

263
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,420
It's okay, man. Ignore him.

264
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:55,920
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

265
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:59,629
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

266
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,170
Manu!

267
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,920
I cut my vein!

268
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,129
- Are you okay?
- No..

269
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:19,212
What happened?

270
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,670
- Riz! Jomo! Is anyone there?
- There's nobody.

271
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:23,462
Come, sit! Take it easy!

272
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:26,379
Careful.

273
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:27,920
Our cleaner also ran away.

274
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,170
Water, please.

275
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,962
- The blood's going into my nose.
- Give it to me.

276
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:42,295
Relax.

277
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:45,105
- It's not a fracture, right?
- No.

278
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:45,962
Sure?

279
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,545
- Your nose might turn crooked..
- No!

280
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,545
Don't say that.
I can't have a crooked nose.

281
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,795
It's a minor injury.

282
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:55,337
Just keep your head back,
and no weights for a week.

283
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,254
I have a competition to win, ma'am.

284
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:58,879
Thank you, doctor.

285
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,004
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

286
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:01,129
Come.

287
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,004
- Careful.
- How can I rest?

288
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,254
The competition's coming up.

289
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:07,545
Shall we talk about that later?
I'll drop you off at home first.

290
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,129
No, I'll manage. Don't worry.

291
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,504
You've shown enough courage for the day.

292
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:13,420
I'm free all day now anyway.

293
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:15,045
I missed my Zumba class.

294
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:18,212
- One second. Wait here, alright?
- You missed your class for me?!

295
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:20,087
- Auto!
- Sorry.

296
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:39,379
Are you okay?

297
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:44,504
Accident?

298
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,379
No. It's nothing.

299
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:50,754
Hey, handsome! How's it going?

300
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:53,170
- I'm good.
- What happened to your nose, sweetie?

301
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
I injured myself.

302
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:56,629
Oh. Looks like
Lady Luck's smiling on you.

303
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:59,379
Show the pretty lady how generous you are.
Loosen up your purse.

304
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:00,462
Come on!

305
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,837
Such a lovely pair!
May your love bloom forever!

306
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:06,712
Hey, hero!

307
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:09,295
You can stop here.

308
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,462
Thank you.

309
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,004
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

310
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,920
- Bye, take care.
- Bye.

311
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:18,504
Manu!

312
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,004
- Are you okay?
- Yes, almost.

313
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:22,170
Come, I'll walk you home.

314
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:27,795
Careful.

315
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,212
Manu! What happened to you?

316
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,180
- It's nothing. Continue your prayers.
- Hey!

317
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:44,462
Naveen!

318
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,045
Naveen!

319
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:48,254
- Coming, Papa!
- <i>Hey..</i>

320
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,545
<i>At least, tell me, how was the pudding?</i>

321
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,420
- I'll call you later.
- Naveen!

322
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,879
Did someone die, or what?

323
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:02,045
Leave everything and come here.

324
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:03,379
It's urgent.

325
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,087
You injured yourself again?!

326
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:08,545
Lifting weights at the gym
every day like a mule!

327
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:09,754
I keep telling him..

328
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,045
Hello, miss.

329
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:15,087
Hello.

330
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,670
Hey, won't you introduce us?

331
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:22,837
Yeah. This is Maanvi.
She teaches Zumba at our gym.

332
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,462
That's my papa.

333
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:25,962
- Namaste, sir.
- Namaste.

334
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:28,337
And there, behind you,
is my good old grandpa.

335
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
Hello.

336
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:33,212
God bless you!

337
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:35,295
Nice.

338
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,170
Dear... are you from Chandigarh?

339
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:42,670
- No.
- I mean, are your parents based here?

340
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:44,212
No, they stay in Ambala.

341
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:47,087
Papa was a brigadier in the army.
He's retired now.

342
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,920
Oh! You're a soldier's daughter?!

343
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Long live India!

344
00:21:52,462 --> 00:21:53,504
Long live our soldiers!

345
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:56,420
<i>O motherland, I salute thee!</i>

346
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:58,879
Papa, control yourself.

347
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,462
So, you guys met at the gym!

348
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:06,087
Manu didn't tell us anything.

349
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,504
Enough, Papa. Is this an interrogation?

350
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,795
Don't interrupt your elders.

351
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,504
- Grandpa! What's the emergency?
- Manu!

352
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:17,920
Oh, God! Fatty! What happened?
Did you hurt yourself with a dumbbell?

353
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,920
These are my sisters.

354
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:21,545
- Hello.
- Hi.

355
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,670
- Hello!
- Hi.

356
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,420
- Have we met before?
- No, I just joined the gym..

357
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:26,504
Don't you have to go?

358
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,045
Yeah.

359
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,420
- I'll drop you..
- No, you please rest!

360
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,313
- The auto's waiting outside.
- Are you sure?

361
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:37,004
- You take care, get rest.
- See you tomorrow.

362
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:39,212
Please have something
before you go, at least!

363
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:40,962
- Naveen!
- Some other time.

364
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:42,045
Yeah. Please wait.

365
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:43,212
Bye, Manu!

366
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,295
- But..
- Bye!

367
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,462
- She'll find her way.
- Okay, I guess.

368
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,504
Wow, fatty!
What a relief, seriously!

369
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:50,962
She was so pretty!

370
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,379
No wonder you didn't talk to Nikita!

371
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:55,504
When were you going to tell us?

372
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:56,795
Tell you what?

373
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,129
She's a friend.

374
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,087
We're just good friends, okay?

375
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,670
Right, just "good friends!"
Drop the act already!

376
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,129
Don't jump the gun.

377
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,795
If anything happens,
I'll tell you on my own.

378
00:23:08,629 --> 00:23:10,670
Hey! Why are you being so shy?

379
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:14,295
You used to pee in my lap as a kid.
Remember?

380
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:16,295
Enough now, or I'll do it again.

381
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:29,129
FOR TODAY

382
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:36,504
YOU ARE WELCOME, FATTY.

383
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,587
WHEN?

384
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,670
What's the problem with meeting him?

385
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:00,545
Give the guy a chance.

386
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:02,754
Everyone's not the same.

387
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,004
He's just called you for lunch.

388
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:35,629
- How's it going?
- Good.

389
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:37,295
- Please sit.
- Yes.

390
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Yeah, here.

391
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,754
<i>- Manu Munjal's on stage now.</i>
- Your order, ma'am?

392
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:48,379
<i>He looks really determined today.</i>

393
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,254
You're so good!
You were almost there!

394
00:24:51,337 --> 00:24:52,337
<i>...has lost again!</i>

395
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,962
I mean... that's very impressive.

396
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:56,587
I had almost won.

397
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,254
That Sandy came in last
minute and psyched me out.

398
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:01,462
He's always been a scoundrel.

399
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,920
Why don't you try out
Zumba for a few days?

400
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,754
Jumba? Me?

401
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:11,295
I'm a bodybuilder, not a peacock.

402
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:14,212
My reputation in the market
will go for a toss.

403
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,212
It's not dancing, it's Zumba.

404
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,795
Your flexibility will increase.
It'll help you with your squats.

405
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:22,170
Just a suggestion.

406
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:25,355
I've got a great physiotherapist.
I always go all out with my squats anyway.

407
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:26,379
Thank you.

408
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:28,379
- Enjoy your meal, sir.
- Sure, will do.

409
00:25:32,254 --> 00:25:35,170
Oh, sorry. I start intermittent
fasting after 7:00 p.m.

410
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,755
I've got to have 150 grams
of protein before that.

411
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Yeah, please go ahead.

412
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,504
Don't notice me.

413
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,754
I've got to win the G.O.A.T
competition this year.

414
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,587
If I don't, hell will break loose.
At home, at the gym.

415
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:54,420
- I..
- Why take so much pressure?

416
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
Well...

417
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,920
you have no clue what my family's like!

418
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:00,545
Why?

419
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:02,337
They seemed pretty cute to me.

420
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,420
They just look cute.
They're a bunch of thugs.

421
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Seriously!

422
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:10,587
I mean, they do love me a lot.

423
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,337
I accept that.

424
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,920
But they poke their nose into everything.

425
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:20,629
What's your scene, by the way?

426
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:25,337
Well...

427
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:27,629
I'm the only child.

428
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,379
Papa means everything to me.
He's my rock.

429
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,170
My mom...

430
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:36,545
we don't get along much.

431
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
Why?

432
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:41,087
Well...

433
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:44,212
she can't accept who I am.

434
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:48,045
I don't believe you.

435
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:50,212
You're such a sorted girl.

436
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:53,212
I know, right? Thanks.

437
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:56,545
But she doesn't think so.

438
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:59,129
How is that possible?

439
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:01,545
Tell me.

440
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,254
Come on.

441
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,045
Never mind.

442
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,044
- You don't have to if it's awkward.
- Good evening.

443
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:17,462
I don't talk to anyone
about my mother either.

444
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,670
Why?

445
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:20,879
It hurts.

446
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:24,837
- I was 13 when she died.
- Oh, no.

447
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:27,420
I'm so sorry, I didn't..

448
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:30,087
I had not eaten for two days.

449
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:32,004
I had slipped into depression.

450
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:34,745
Then I got an eating disorder
and turned into a balloon.

451
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,837
At school, in the streets,
everyone would bully me.

452
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,295
That's when I decided that...
I'd become a bodybuilder.

453
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,587
I joined the gym right then.

454
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:46,670
When I lift the barbell...

455
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:50,629
and those veins pop out,
it gives me a high like no other.

456
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,754
It's like a divine experience.

457
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:54,629
Hey, easy!

458
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:58,187
I still think you should take my advice.

459
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:00,254
Do some Zumba until the competition.

460
00:28:01,337 --> 00:28:02,337
You'll thank me later.

461
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:08,545
Are you always so wound up?

462
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,920
Tight clothes, tight dreams.

463
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,837
Let your muscles breathe a little.

464
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:16,587
They'll thank you.

465
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:19,379
So, tell me, what music do you like?

466
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:22,879
Punjabi!

467
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:28,545
Five, six, seven, eight!

468
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:30,837
Roll and roll!

469
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Very nice!

470
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,629
Back straight.

471
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:37,962
Come, I'll show you.

472
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,920
Round...

473
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,212
Nice.

474
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Okay, guys!

475
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:51,254
One, two, three, four!

476
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,962
Roll! Roll your shoulders!

477
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:57,795
Hi!

478
00:28:58,587 --> 00:28:59,587
Hi!

479
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:01,087
- Can we join you?
- Yeah, of course!

480
00:29:18,462 --> 00:29:21,462
You're a Zumba queen!
You're such a good teacher!

481
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:22,462
- Thank you.
- Knock on wood.

482
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,129
May God protect you
from the evil eye!

483
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:25,712
- We'll come daily now.
- Okay.

484
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:26,855
- Cool!
- I'll see you soon then.

485
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,795
- Okay, take care. God bless you.
- Bye.

486
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:30,004
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

487
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Where is Manu?

488
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:37,712
What were they saying?

489
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,837
God bless, knock on wood...
stuff like that.

490
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,962
- Why?
- No, it's nothing.

491
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:44,712
- What's up?
- Nothing.

492
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:47,129
Say.

493
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:49,587
- Now they'll shout from the rooftops.
- Shout what?

494
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,837
They think something
is cooking between us.

495
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,230
So, tell them there's nothing.
What's the problem?

496
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,545
The problem is that
they're like the CBI agents.

497
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:02,004
Once they're at it,
they'll sniff the truth..

498
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,129
How's this one?

499
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Hey!

500
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:21,004
Maanvi!

501
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,590
Where are you lost? If you didn't want
to come here, you could've told me.

502
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:28,545
It's not like that.

503
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:30,837
It's very hot.

504
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,004
Your girl's going to go crazy.

505
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:35,504
Why are you overthinking it?

506
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,504
I don't know, really.

507
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,045
What if it ends up the same way?

508
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:46,837
If you say that again,
I'll murder you.

509
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:49,504
It's just a Holi party, not a proposal!

510
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:50,795
Relax.

511
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:53,545
So, should I go?

512
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:54,962
Sir!

513
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:56,754
Can I get a knife?

514
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,379
Okay, fine. I won't say it again.

515
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:02,629
Excuse me,
can we get two of these, please?

516
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,129
Bras before bros, am I right?

517
00:31:08,337 --> 00:31:10,587
Come on! Come on, tiger!

518
00:31:10,712 --> 00:31:12,087
Kill it!

519
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:15,545
That's it! Now, keep it down!

520
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:17,962
Very good, man! Well done!

521
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:19,754
Awesome, bro!

522
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,754
- More sets, come on!
<i>- Hi, Manvinder.</i>

523
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:24,129
<i>Send me the address. I'll be there.</i>

524
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:30,379
- When is Holi?
- When is Holi?

525
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,004
<i>Hey, lover.</i>

526
00:31:57,504 --> 00:32:01,045
<i>Hear the birds sing
And the anklet-bells ring.</i>

527
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:04,504
<i>What should I do, my love?</i>

528
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:08,379
<i>How should I fight
Against this cruel world?</i>

529
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:11,795
<i>What should I do, my love?</i>

530
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:15,545
<i>Girls gotta chug-hug-chug-chug!</i>

531
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:19,170
<i>Rob them boys like thugs-thugs-thugs!</i>

532
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:22,754
<i>They chug like pros
And rob them bros.</i>

533
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,712
<i>Beat the boys at their games.</i>

534
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:26,462
<i>Let the world go up in flames.</i>

535
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,045
<i>You set, me set, beat set, let's go!</i>

536
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:33,545
<i>You cause a riot at the club
You got them boys lining up.</i>

537
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:37,045
<i>Baby, burn the floor
Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

538
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:40,837
<i>Dolled up like a butterfly
Your booty flies smokin' high.</i>

539
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,629
<i>Baby, burn the floor
Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

540
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,837
<i>You cause a riot at the club.</i>

541
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,670
<i>Baby, burn the floor.</i>

542
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:51,504
<i>Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

543
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:55,129
<i>Dolled up like a butterfly.</i>

544
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:57,045
<i>Baby, burn the floor.</i>

545
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:58,795
<i>Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

546
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:17,420
<i>Meeting you has cast a spell on me.</i>

547
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:21,212
<i>My heart can't help but rebel.</i>

548
00:33:21,295 --> 00:33:24,670
<i>It can't keep calm, it's out of control.</i>

549
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,920
<i>Girls gotta chug-hug-chug-chug!</i>

550
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:35,462
<i>Rob them boys like thugs-thugs-thugs!</i>

551
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:39,087
<i>They chug like pros
And rob them bros.</i>

552
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:41,087
<i>Beat the boys at their games.</i>

553
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,920
<i>Let the world go up in flames.</i>

554
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:46,420
<i>You set, me set, beat set, let's go.</i>

555
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:49,879
<i>You cause a riot at the club
You got them boys lining up.</i>

556
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:53,504
<i>Baby, burn the floor
Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

557
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:57,170
<i>Dolled up like a butterfly
Your booty flies smokin' high.</i>

558
00:33:57,254 --> 00:34:01,004
<i>Baby, burn the floor
Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

559
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:04,170
<i>You cause a riot at the club.</i>

560
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:06,212
<i>Baby, burn the floor.</i>

561
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,045
<i>Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

562
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,462
<i>Dolled up like a butterfly.</i>

563
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,337
<i>Baby, burn the floor.</i>

564
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:15,337
<i>Yeah, burn the floor.</i>

565
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:17,545
Are you okay?

566
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:48,629
Manu, I...

567
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:53,087
I want to tell you something.

568
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:55,295
Don't say a thing.

569
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:43,879
Thanks.

570
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:47,170
Who says thanks?

571
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,420
I do.

572
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,045
Your friends must be waiting.

573
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:00,087
What friends?

574
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:03,004
<i>What is this attraction?</i>

575
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:07,420
<i>It's such a distraction.</i>

576
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:11,379
<i>What is this attraction?</i>

577
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,462
<i>It's such a distraction.</i>

578
00:36:16,712 --> 00:36:19,879
<i>My heart goes
Slowly slowly, pitter-patter.</i>

579
00:36:19,962 --> 00:36:21,879
<i>Trails in vain, sighs so close.</i>

580
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,712
<i>Whisk my breath away before you go.</i>

581
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:29,337
<i>Your sweet nothings draw me in</i>

582
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,420
<i>'Til I can't hold back anymore.</i>

583
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:33,420
<i>Yeah, I'm losing control.</i>

584
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:37,462
<i>Your sweet scent draws me close
'Til it engulfs me wholly.</i>

585
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:42,129
<i>Yeah, I'm losing control.</i>

586
00:36:49,004 --> 00:36:51,462
<i>What is this attraction?</i>

587
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,462
<i>What is this attraction?</i>

588
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:01,379
<i>The fever continues to soar</i>

589
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:03,379
<i>I can feel it in my core.</i>

590
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:05,920
<i>My intentions don't feel so pure</i>

591
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:09,337
<i>I'm sloshed on pegs so large.</i>

592
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,295
<i>Getting friskier every glass.</i>

593
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,962
<i>Intoxication's taking charge.</i>

594
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:17,420
<i>The fever continues to soar.</i>

595
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:21,712
<i>Your intentions don't feel so pure.</i>

596
00:37:22,254 --> 00:37:25,379
<i>I'm sloshed on pegs so large.</i>

597
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:27,379
<i>Getting friskier every glass.</i>

598
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:28,670
<i>Intoxication's taking charge.</i>

599
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:30,212
<i>My heart goes.</i>

600
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:32,212
<i>My heart goes.</i>

601
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:35,879
<i>My heart whistles and swoons.</i>

602
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,879
<i>Seeing stars in afternoons.</i>

603
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:40,712
<i>Baby, now take me to the moon.</i>

604
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,379
<i>Your sweet nothings draw me in</i>

605
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:47,379
<i>'Til I can't hold back anymore.</i>

606
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,420
<i>Yeah, I am losing control.</i>

607
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:53,462
<i>Your sweet scent draws me close.</i>

608
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:54,920
<i>Yeah, it's keeping me close.</i>

609
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:57,420
<i>Yeah, I am losing control.</i>

610
00:37:57,504 --> 00:38:01,420
<i>Your sweet nothings draw me in</i>

611
00:38:01,504 --> 00:38:03,420
<i>'Til I can't hold back anymore.</i>

612
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:05,379
<i>Yeah, I am losing control.</i>

613
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:09,420
<i>Your sweet scent draws me close.</i>

614
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:14,004
<i>It's keeping me close
Yeah, I am losing control.</i>

615
00:38:21,004 --> 00:38:23,420
<i>What is this attraction?</i>

616
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,212
<i>What is this attraction?</i>

617
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:31,462
<i>What is this attraction?</i>

618
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,670
Where are you?

619
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Good morning.

620
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:54,254
Morning.

621
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:23,129
You're something else, man!

622
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:27,587
A class apart.

623
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,587
Eat up before it's time for your fasting.

624
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:44,712
I think I'm in love.

625
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:48,212
Madly in love.

626
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,295
Will you marry me?

627
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:07,545
What happened?

628
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,920
This isn't just a fling for me.

629
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:12,629
I'm serious.

630
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:20,504
I'm also serious.

631
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,420
Then?

632
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:26,879
You think I won't fit in
with your classy folks?

633
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:28,962
I'll spruce up my English,

634
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:32,670
and my Zumba too. With a capital Z.

635
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:36,337
It's not that, Manu. I..

636
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:40,587
There is something else.

637
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,170
What else?

638
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:45,295
I'll adopt the three kids
from your previous marriage.

639
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,420
No problem.

640
00:40:49,087 --> 00:40:50,087
What else?

641
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:56,129
Manu.

642
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,670
I'm...

643
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:07,212
I'm a trans girl.

644
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:08,879
What?

645
00:41:09,795 --> 00:41:10,795
What's that?

646
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:14,045
- I wasn't always like this.
- Then what were you like?

647
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,504
I was born a boy...

648
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:29,170
but I was always a girl inside.

649
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,587
I lived a lie for 20 years.

650
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:34,337
I hated myself.

651
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:36,045
I fought many battles.

652
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:38,587
I even left my home.

653
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,587
Then, six years ago,
I finally got my surgery

654
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,629
and became on the outside who
I always was on the inside.

655
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:51,254
Inside, outside, surgery...
what's all this?

656
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:53,795
What are you talking about?

657
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,754
As a kid, my name wasn't Maanvi.

658
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:12,337
It was Manu... Manu Brar.

659
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
That's not possible.

660
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,545
You can't show me some random photo and..
I don't believe you.

661
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:32,712
That day, on Holi, I wanted to tell you.

662
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:36,254
I tried, but I couldn't. I'm sorry.

663
00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:38,962
I did.

664
00:42:46,545 --> 00:42:47,545
You're a dude, Maanvi?!

665
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,337
That was just my body.

666
00:42:50,629 --> 00:42:52,587
- Then who's this?
- This is when I was him.

667
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,282
This is what I used to look like.

668
00:42:56,795 --> 00:43:00,087
Him-her, he-she...
my brain's about to explode!

669
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,587
You've cheated me!

670
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:05,837
I had sex with a man?!

671
00:43:06,504 --> 00:43:09,462
I had sex with a man!
Oh, God! Kill me now!

672
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,629
Forgive me, God. So much sex.

673
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:14,587
- I'm not a boy.
- So much! I want to throw up!

674
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,087
I'm not a man.
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

675
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,462
Shut up!
Spare me the fancy English!

676
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:22,379
If I let myself go, I'll destroy you!

677
00:43:23,254 --> 00:43:24,254
Out.

678
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:25,504
Get out of here!

679
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,670
- Get out!
- This is my house.

680
00:43:30,545 --> 00:43:32,087
Your house, right. I'll...

681
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:34,379
- Manu, please.
- I had sex with a man.

682
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:35,462
At least, hear me out.

683
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:38,545
- Had I lost it?
- Manu.

684
00:43:39,254 --> 00:43:41,045
- I had sex with a man.
- Manu.

685
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,754
Actually, wait. Not a man.
You're not even a man.

686
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:45,754
Manu.

687
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:47,337
You won't get away with this.

688
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,295
I'm going to ruin your life.

689
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,920
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

690
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,129
Trans girl... what does it mean?

691
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:36,629
Is she into trance music?

692
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:37,795
No, man.

693
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:39,504
She was a guy before.

694
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,540
Then she got surgery, and...

695
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,087
- Surgery? As in?
- That kind of surgery.

696
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:48,629
Holy shit! Our Maanvi?

697
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:50,170
Her name isn't Maanvi.

698
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:52,129
It's Manu.

699
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
Manu Brar.

700
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:55,545
Damn, bro.

701
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,360
So, you literally screwed yourself?!

702
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,754
- How did you not realize it?
- Did either of you jackasses realize it?

703
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:03,629
Weren't you staring at her every day?

704
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:04,712
Don't get mad, bro.

705
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,420
He means to say...

706
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:09,170
you drove the car,
but you didn't even check under the hood?!

707
00:45:10,212 --> 00:45:12,092
How could you not realize
it despite having sex?

708
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,170
Sex.

709
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,337
The sex was great, man.

710
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:17,962
Normal.

711
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:19,295
Better than normal.

712
00:45:20,712 --> 00:45:22,879
- From where did you do it?
- What the.. You moron!

713
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,795
Are you nuts?
I did it the way everyone does!

714
00:45:27,045 --> 00:45:28,405
You both are going to die virgins!

715
00:45:29,754 --> 00:45:30,754
Normal?!

716
00:45:31,504 --> 00:45:32,504
Normal!

717
00:45:32,837 --> 00:45:34,587
I don't know what to do now.

718
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:37,254
What do you mean?

719
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,462
We'll go teach him a lesson!
What does he think of himself?

720
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:42,754
Is there no law and order in this country?

721
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:44,087
Bloody eunuch!

722
00:46:01,629 --> 00:46:03,004
Manu... she's here.

723
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,420
Go, tell her.

724
00:46:04,754 --> 00:46:06,920
This <i>Ram Aur Shyam</i>
act won't cut it here!

725
00:46:07,004 --> 00:46:09,462
Not <i>Ram Aur Shyam,</i> bro.
It's <i>Seeta Aur Geeta.</i>

726
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:11,462
No, dude. It's like Seeta and Shyam.

727
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:16,420
Manu, can we talk
for five minutes, please?

728
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,004
Say whatever you want to
in front of my friends.

729
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,462
I won't talk to you alone.

730
00:46:34,379 --> 00:46:37,337
If we could just sit and talk...
at least, let me explain myself properly.

731
00:46:40,837 --> 00:46:42,087
Good morning, Miss Maanvi.

732
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:45,254
We've practiced the steps
that you taught us yesterday.

733
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:49,504
So, should we show it to you?

734
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:10,629
Holy hell! She looks exactly like a girl!

735
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,795
No one can tell that she's a eunuch.

736
00:47:15,712 --> 00:47:17,420
Will you stop using that word?

737
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,504
Her name's Maanvi!
Maanvi! Alright?

738
00:47:21,254 --> 00:47:23,920
A boy can't become a girl
just by changing his name.

739
00:47:24,337 --> 00:47:27,129
If I change my name from Jomo to Jamila,
will I become a girl?

740
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:29,712
I'll turn you into Jamila! Should I?

741
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:31,837
- Manu, let go of him!
- You'd better stop it!

742
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,271
- Have you lost it?
- Watch your tongue!

743
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,420
Let go of him! Let go!

744
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:39,629
What the heck, bro!

745
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:41,462
I'll beat you to a pulp!

746
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:43,295
Now say eunuch again!

747
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:46,712
- Eunuch.
- You asshole!

748
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:50,754
- Her name's Maanvi!
- Let go of him!

749
00:47:50,837 --> 00:47:53,295
Sis, why is Manu fighting?

750
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,170
I won't spare you!

751
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,462
Manu!

752
00:47:58,129 --> 00:47:59,754
- Bloody lowlife, I will..
- Stop it!

753
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:02,354
Why are you fighting like cats and dogs?

754
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:04,587
Why do you care?

755
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:06,670
Go, dance. Make merry.

756
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:08,587
Leave me alone.

757
00:48:12,295 --> 00:48:13,462
Hey!

758
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,230
What's going on? Why were you fighting?

759
00:48:16,837 --> 00:48:19,004
It's nothing, sister.

760
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:23,045
We were just doing MMA practice.
Bro got a bit too carried away.

761
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:25,295
You've got to take it easy, bro!

762
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:27,379
One could get hurt.

763
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:30,629
Please continue with your class.
Zumba and all.

764
00:48:31,754 --> 00:48:32,754
Maanvi!

765
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:38,712
She's calling you. Outside.

766
00:48:47,962 --> 00:48:51,420
Do you want to quit the competition?
Then you can eat all day like a pig.

767
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,712
- Get me another glass of lassi.
- Yes.

768
00:48:53,795 --> 00:48:54,629
With extra cream on top.

769
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,045
- Cancel it.
- Shut up.

770
00:48:57,754 --> 00:48:59,462
I'm really sorry, man.

771
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:01,754
Forgive me, please.

772
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:05,129
Please don't be mad at me.

773
00:49:05,837 --> 00:49:06,837
Then what should I do?

774
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:08,545
Jump off a cliff?

775
00:49:10,004 --> 00:49:11,879
Look, bro. What's done is done.

776
00:49:12,337 --> 00:49:13,337
It's all good.

777
00:49:14,004 --> 00:49:15,844
Whatever your preference
is, we'll support you.

778
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,462
To each his own!

779
00:49:18,045 --> 00:49:19,045
What?

780
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:20,837
What do you mean?

781
00:49:22,712 --> 00:49:24,962
Look, bro. You can try out
this homo option if you want.

782
00:49:27,337 --> 00:49:29,420
There's this amazing app called Grindr.

783
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:31,879
You'll find many hot guys on it.

784
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:33,795
No one's going to bother you.

785
00:49:34,129 --> 00:49:35,837
Times have changed.

786
00:49:36,129 --> 00:49:38,329
You're free to do it however
and with whomever you want.

787
00:50:16,712 --> 00:50:18,004
I should've told him earlier.

788
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:20,337
I thought he'll understand.

789
00:50:21,212 --> 00:50:22,212
I don't know why.

790
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,670
Hello! Hold on!

791
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:27,974
Should you go around wearing
a T-shirt that says, "I'm a trans girl"?

792
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:30,170
He's the one who came
running after you.

793
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:31,754
But that's what always happens.

794
00:50:32,254 --> 00:50:33,879
I like someone. Someone likes me.

795
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,670
And then again...

796
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,170
Stop going on a pointless guilt trip.

797
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:40,712
Don't worry about all these things.

798
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,837
What guilt trip?
She's happily chomping on a pizza.

799
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,420
You have a competition
coming up in 15 days.

800
00:50:55,587 --> 00:50:56,795
Do you want to say something?

801
00:50:57,379 --> 00:50:59,313
Can we talk elsewhere?
There are families around here.

802
00:50:59,337 --> 00:51:00,337
Why?

803
00:51:00,462 --> 00:51:02,855
Are you scared they'll find out?
That you'll be publicly humiliated?

804
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:05,337
Hey, stud! Take it easy, okay?

805
00:51:06,837 --> 00:51:08,045
I'm not talking to you, bro.

806
00:51:08,754 --> 00:51:11,074
- I'll thrash you so hard..
- Akshi, it's okay. I got this.

807
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:12,962
Shall we?

808
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:14,087
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

809
00:51:19,504 --> 00:51:21,045
What are you doing?
You're hurting me!

810
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:23,045
And what about you hurting me?

811
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:26,920
- Forget hurt, you screwed me over!
- Please mind your language.

812
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:28,420
How about you mind your actions!

813
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:30,462
What did I ever do to you?

814
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,837
Did I ever touch you,
hurt you even a little bit?

815
00:51:33,545 --> 00:51:34,545
Then why?

816
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:37,170
Why did you lie to me?
You're a bloody cheater!

817
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
You wanted sex, right?

818
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:42,920
Why me? You could've gone
and screwed anyone else!

819
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:44,337
I am not a gigolo!

820
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,629
What do you mean
I could've screwed anyone?

821
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:49,795
Get to the point.

822
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:51,045
Oh, really?

823
00:51:51,962 --> 00:51:53,254
Do you have the guts to hear it?

824
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:54,521
I've been hearing shit from
people ever since I was a kid.

825
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:55,730
You're not the first man to do it.

826
00:51:55,754 --> 00:51:57,274
I'm not a man, I'm a frigging jackass!

827
00:51:58,004 --> 00:51:59,379
I've been having sex with a man.

828
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:02,087
Will you please stop saying that?

829
00:52:02,337 --> 00:52:03,879
- Don't shout!
- Why shouldn't I?

830
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,730
You shoot your mouth off like
a jackass, and I should keep quiet?!

831
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:08,837
Well, if I'm a jackass,
I'll talk like one, alright?

832
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,004
What do you want from me?

833
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,920
I want you to leave this city.

834
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,254
Stay out of Chandigarh's borders, got it?

835
00:52:23,129 --> 00:52:27,379
Take your ugly, manly face and get lost!

836
00:52:29,962 --> 00:52:30,962
What?

837
00:52:31,504 --> 00:52:32,504
Did that hurt?

838
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:36,462
If it feels so awful to hear,
imagine how it feels to have touched you.

839
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:42,837
You goddamned..

840
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,800
Don't you dare touch me,
I'll rip you to shreds!

841
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:50,629
Weren't you in love with this manly face?

842
00:52:51,754 --> 00:52:53,170
I was a class apart, right?

843
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:54,504
You were besotted!

844
00:52:54,795 --> 00:52:57,379
Yeah, I had lost my marbles!
I'm back to my senses now!

845
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:00,021
I don't want to get caught
up in this trans-homo crap!

846
00:53:00,045 --> 00:53:01,712
I want a normal..
Hey, listen to me!

847
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,295
I want everything normal.

848
00:53:03,462 --> 00:53:06,337
Normal sex, a normal life..
I'm a normal guy, alright? Normal!

849
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:08,504
It all boils down to sex
for you ultimately, right?

850
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,879
- Is that all you care about?
- Of course not!

851
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:12,504
But you just wanted sex, didn't you?

852
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:15,499
- That's why you lied..
- I didn't lie about anything.

853
00:53:15,754 --> 00:53:18,129
I just didn't tell you about my past.

854
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,879
What should I do now?
Hang myself?

855
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:24,629
How many times should I say sorry?
Should I fall at your feet?

856
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:27,129
What's the use? My life's ruined now.

857
00:53:29,545 --> 00:53:31,670
You uncouth prick!

858
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,254
What have you lost?

859
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,504
How's your life ruined?

860
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,087
Okay, even if I wanted sex...

861
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:41,879
didn't you enjoy it too?

862
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,795
And if you want normal sex
with a normal girl, then go ahead!

863
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,170
Why are you here?

864
00:53:50,254 --> 00:53:52,670
Don't try this stunt
with me again, okay?

865
00:53:53,879 --> 00:53:56,004
If you want to act tough, then so can I!

866
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:58,504
You have no idea whom you're messing with.

867
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,004
One scratch on your nose,
and you were howling like a baby.

868
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:05,327
Imagine what I have cut off
and what my body has endured.

869
00:54:07,004 --> 00:54:09,379
Think of the pain
I must have gone through.

870
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:16,045
So, now, nothing scares me anymore.

871
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,420
Show me what you've got. Bring it on.

872
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:47,254
Left! Right! Left! Right!

873
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:49,212
Left! Right!

874
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:53,462
Left and stretch! Do stretch!

875
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,337
Enough of this drag show!

876
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,420
Throw her out right now!

877
00:55:01,712 --> 00:55:02,712
Manu...

878
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:06,004
we were just going over our accounts.

879
00:55:07,462 --> 00:55:09,587
The profits this quarter are killer, bro.

880
00:55:11,295 --> 00:55:13,420
Anyway, she has
a three-month contract, right?

881
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:16,087
Let her stay a while longer.

882
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:19,754
What are you saying, bro?
Is it business over friendship now?

883
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:24,545
Try to understand. It's your own gym.

884
00:55:25,004 --> 00:55:26,724
We've got so many clients
after a long time.

885
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:29,837
And they're all extremely
happy with Maanvi.

886
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:37,212
Jomo's right, Manu. Keep personal
and professional matters separate.

887
00:55:37,795 --> 00:55:39,962
Don't you want to make it big like Sandy?

888
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,212
Sandy can screw himself!

889
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:43,420
To hell with him and his gym chain!

890
00:55:43,837 --> 00:55:45,045
I don't want to be like him.

891
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,795
Be reasonable, Manu.

892
00:55:48,504 --> 00:55:50,754
If we throw Maanvi out,
people will raise a ruckus.

893
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:52,462
And your sisters...

894
00:55:52,754 --> 00:55:54,170
they'll be at our throats.

895
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:55,837
What will you do then?

896
00:55:57,337 --> 00:55:59,462
Look, man.
They all look so happy.

897
00:56:09,962 --> 00:56:12,462
Have some patience. He is getting it.

898
00:56:12,545 --> 00:56:13,545
Yes!

899
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,420
- Here you go! Piping hot <i>kulchas!</i>
- Give it to me.

900
00:56:16,504 --> 00:56:18,962
- Here, Grandpa.
- Pass me the butter.

901
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:21,271
- Butter, please.
- There you go. Oh, butter.

902
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:22,879
- Yes, please give it to me.
- Here.

903
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,087
Manu, have some.

904
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:38,379
How's Maanvi, son?

905
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:41,170
Why? Do you also have something to say?

906
00:56:41,629 --> 00:56:42,879
Not at all, son.

907
00:56:43,254 --> 00:56:44,712
In fact, I'm really happy.

908
00:56:45,462 --> 00:56:48,087
Love has knocked on your
door for the first time.

909
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:52,545
Now just wait and see how
it transforms your life.

910
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:55,504
What's with this sudden poetic talk?
Just get to the point!

911
00:56:57,545 --> 00:56:59,212
Look, Manu. Once you get married,

912
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,355
it'll pave the way
for my love story as well.

913
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,605
Unbelievable, man! Everyone's busy
making their own damned movie!

914
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:04,629
No one cares about me.

915
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:06,504
Who's stopping you from
chasing your dreams?

916
00:57:06,879 --> 00:57:07,962
Marry Maanvi.

917
00:57:08,795 --> 00:57:10,170
You could also move in with her.

918
00:57:10,962 --> 00:57:13,129
Your father's a progressive man now.

919
00:57:13,754 --> 00:57:16,920
Ever since Tasneem
has entered my life, I've changed..

920
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:19,295
Papa, don't fire your gun off my shoulder.

921
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,962
It's been 17 years since your mother died.

922
00:57:22,712 --> 00:57:23,629
How long must I stay alone..

923
00:57:23,712 --> 00:57:25,754
- What kind of a father are you?
- A practical one!

924
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,629
I've turned 55 selling toilet seats.

925
00:57:29,337 --> 00:57:30,670
I won't get another chance.

926
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:32,879
Help your father out!

927
00:57:33,504 --> 00:57:35,879
Then you will be happy,
your sisters will be happy,

928
00:57:36,337 --> 00:57:38,379
your grandpa will be satisfied,
and I'll be free.

929
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:41,212
I want one more!

930
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:43,670
You'll ruin your teeth.

931
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,045
- Go.
- Thank you!

932
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,004
Give me two more.

933
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:52,670
Once you and Maanvi get engaged,
only then will we be at peace.

934
00:57:52,754 --> 00:57:55,504
Whatever you're thinking
is not going to happen!

935
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:57,754
What won't happen?

936
00:57:57,837 --> 00:57:58,837
Forget about Maanvi.

937
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:00,879
She's not my type.

938
00:58:02,295 --> 00:58:03,337
What do you mean?

939
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:06,629
You go to the gym together,
chat on WhatsApp all night.

940
00:58:07,004 --> 00:58:08,004
We know everything!

941
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:10,462
You don't get it. We aren't compatible.

942
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:12,462
She's a very different kind of girl.

943
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:14,295
We belong to different worlds.

944
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:18,587
Look, Manu. When two hearts unite,
every gap can be bridged.

945
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:20,712
How should I make you understand?

946
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,545
- Are you having problems in the bedroom?
- As in?

947
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:26,087
As in, why are you so frustrated?

948
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:28,420
You were fighting with
Jomo at the gym too.

949
00:58:29,337 --> 00:58:31,462
Whatever the issue is, say it openly!

950
00:58:32,129 --> 00:58:34,379
Now we're not only your
sisters but also your mother.

951
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:38,087
- Speak up! Is it a bedroom problem?
- I don't know!

952
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:40,420
I'll give you a doctor's number.

953
00:58:41,004 --> 00:58:43,170
He'll turn you from a donkey
to a racehorse in a month.

954
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:46,170
<i>Let's go, my horse!</i>

955
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:53,254
Manu, don't give up so easily.
You won't find a better girl than Maanvi.

956
00:58:53,337 --> 00:58:55,545
What about Nikita,
the girl from Bharat Matrimony?

957
00:58:55,795 --> 00:58:58,045
Why shop at a dollar store
when you can wear couture!

958
00:58:58,545 --> 00:59:01,045
If you must dream,
dream of Gucci and Armani.

959
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,837
She's beautiful and well-spoken.

960
00:59:04,212 --> 00:59:05,420
You look great together.

961
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:07,837
- Go, talk to her!
- Yes!

962
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,712
We want to meet her parents.

963
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:12,087
- Sis, can I get a hankie?
- Do you have a hankie?

964
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,837
What you'll get is a tight slap!

965
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,920
Silly man-child!

966
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:19,587
Maanvi!

967
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,254
Hey, listen to me!

968
00:59:24,337 --> 00:59:25,170
Maanvi.

969
00:59:25,254 --> 00:59:27,545
Look, don't create a scene here.
It's a residential area.

970
00:59:28,087 --> 00:59:30,170
I'm in no position to create a scene.

971
00:59:30,462 --> 00:59:31,629
I'm royally screwed.

972
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:33,879
My family's gone nuts.

973
00:59:34,462 --> 00:59:35,920
They want to meet your parents.

974
00:59:36,629 --> 00:59:37,629
They're saying..

975
00:59:37,837 --> 00:59:40,077
Can you please tell them
that there's nothing between us?

976
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:43,379
- Why don't you tell them yourself?
- No one listens to me!

977
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:45,545
I'm like a junior artist in my own film.

978
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:48,629
My family's hell-bent
on getting us married.

979
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:51,217
Just reject me once,
and this mess will be over.

980
00:59:54,087 --> 00:59:55,188
And on what basis should I reject you?

981
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:57,462
Say whatever you like.
It doesn't matter.

982
00:59:58,045 --> 01:00:00,212
You can say that I'm down-market,
a wastrel, a loser...

983
01:00:00,879 --> 01:00:01,879
a total failure!

984
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,688
That I scam people by selling
fake protein supplements.

985
01:00:03,712 --> 01:00:06,021
Tell them that you have higher
standards, that you're out of my league.

986
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:08,545
But I didn't reject you.
You're the one who rejected me.

987
01:00:13,087 --> 01:00:14,379
Why are you screwing me up, man?

988
01:00:15,462 --> 01:00:16,782
Just say no and get over with it.

989
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,270
Your family, your problem.
You tell them.

990
01:00:21,337 --> 01:00:22,817
Tell them what? That I dated a eunu..

991
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:28,587
Sorry.

992
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:30,420
I mean, please forgive me.

993
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:32,379
Sorry.

994
01:00:34,754 --> 01:00:35,837
Go, tell them the truth.

995
01:00:36,462 --> 01:00:39,712
Tell them that I'm a trans girl
and I took advantage of you.

996
01:00:40,045 --> 01:00:42,504
Your problem will be solved.
No one will bother you.

997
01:00:43,254 --> 01:00:45,212
- Come on, that's crazy.
- Why?

998
01:00:46,087 --> 01:00:48,527
You hated that I lied, right?
Then go and tell them the truth.

999
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,129
In fact, I'll do it.
Let's end this story.

1000
01:00:52,212 --> 01:00:54,379
- Wait..
- Don't! Don't touch me.

1001
01:00:55,629 --> 01:00:56,629
What's going on?

1002
01:00:58,587 --> 01:00:59,587
What happened, ma'am?

1003
01:01:01,087 --> 01:01:02,587
Is this man bothering you?

1004
01:01:02,962 --> 01:01:05,545
- No...
- No, sir. It's the opposite.

1005
01:01:06,212 --> 01:01:07,837
Actually, I've wronged him.

1006
01:01:09,254 --> 01:01:12,295
I was born a boy.
I got the surgery done and became a girl.

1007
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:14,087
- What?
- I took advantage of him.

1008
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,795
Now he's horrified and traumatized.

1009
01:01:15,879 --> 01:01:17,462
And completely humiliated.

1010
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:20,545
It's a case of cheating
and attempted rape, sir.

1011
01:01:20,879 --> 01:01:22,379
Have you lost it, ma'am?

1012
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:24,129
She's a bit crazy.

1013
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,295
Don't take her seriously.

1014
01:01:27,004 --> 01:01:28,724
It's our internal matter,
we'll sort it out.

1015
01:01:28,795 --> 01:01:30,295
Did I ask for your opinion?

1016
01:01:31,504 --> 01:01:32,504
Look, sir.

1017
01:01:33,545 --> 01:01:34,879
It's just a silly lovers' tiff.

1018
01:01:35,295 --> 01:01:37,396
Don't waste your time on us.
Go, catch some real crooks.

1019
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,504
Hey, hulk!

1020
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,129
Don't preach to the Pope! Back off!

1021
01:01:41,629 --> 01:01:43,920
Ma'am, you seem to be from a good family.

1022
01:01:44,629 --> 01:01:47,670
Whatever your issues are,
please resolve them at home.

1023
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,879
- Yeah.
- Don't create a scene outside!

1024
01:01:50,004 --> 01:01:50,837
Yes, sir.

1025
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,462
And listen, tough guy!
You'd better drop her off at home now!

1026
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:54,962
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

1027
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,504
Come on, now get going!

1028
01:02:05,795 --> 01:02:06,837
Are you out of your mind?

1029
01:02:07,629 --> 01:02:08,712
This isn't your hometown.

1030
01:02:09,504 --> 01:02:10,984
Don't mess around with the cops here.

1031
01:02:11,545 --> 01:02:12,962
You could end up in jail all night.

1032
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:14,545
So? Why are you bothered?

1033
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:16,702
I was telling the truth, right?

1034
01:02:17,545 --> 01:02:19,920
What should I do with you! Oh, God!

1035
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:22,694
Fine. You don't need to do anything.

1036
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:24,337
Just spare me.

1037
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,420
Do you know what the problem is?

1038
01:02:31,337 --> 01:02:33,837
You can't stomach the truth,
and I can't end the charade.

1039
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,170
Go away, Manu.

1040
01:02:40,212 --> 01:02:41,462
Leave me alone.

1041
01:02:50,795 --> 01:02:52,129
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1042
01:02:53,587 --> 01:02:57,045
<i>As my tears flow endlessly.</i>

1043
01:02:57,795 --> 01:03:01,212
<i>Your love has cut me open.</i>

1044
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:06,587
<i>Our chords are now all broken.</i>

1045
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,087
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1046
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:13,587
<i>As my tears flow endlessly.</i>

1047
01:03:14,337 --> 01:03:17,754
<i>Your love has cut me open.</i>

1048
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:23,587
<i>Our chords are now all broken.</i>

1049
01:03:23,962 --> 01:03:27,420
<i>Ever since you left me.</i>

1050
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:31,879
<i>My life's bereft of beauty.</i>

1051
01:03:31,962 --> 01:03:35,920
<i>Away from you, even if I survive.</i>

1052
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:40,129
<i>What good is this life
Without you beside me?</i>

1053
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:45,129
<i>I am meant to be who
I am, and I am a girl.</i>

1054
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:47,629
<i>I was born in the wrong body.</i>

1055
01:03:47,754 --> 01:03:51,587
<i>Millions of people, like myself,
are fighting on a daily basis,</i>

1056
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:54,087
<i>not for your tolerance,
but for your acceptance.</i>

1057
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:57,712
<i>I was severely bullied and
nobody really understood me.</i>

1058
01:03:57,795 --> 01:04:00,795
<i>I thought that I'm going to end up alone.</i>

1059
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:03,712
<i>I'm not going to live this life,
I'm not going to hide myself,</i>

1060
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:05,295
<i>I want to be a beautiful girl!</i>

1061
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:07,129
I was born a boy...

1062
01:04:07,712 --> 01:04:11,504
but I was always a girl inside.

1063
01:04:11,587 --> 01:04:18,545
<i>Your love was measured, part for part.</i>

1064
01:04:23,962 --> 01:04:30,837
<i>Your love was measured, part for part.</i>

1065
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:38,962
<i>If only you had treasured my heart.</i>

1066
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:45,129
<i>My face won't hide behind a veil.</i>

1067
01:04:45,379 --> 01:04:49,545
<i>-My soul has lived to tell its tale</i>
-You're not even a man!

1068
01:04:50,379 --> 01:04:52,629
<i>Get this manly face of yours out of here!</i>

1069
01:04:52,712 --> 01:04:54,254
<i>You've cheated me!</i>

1070
01:04:54,337 --> 01:04:55,337
Manu.

1071
01:04:55,504 --> 01:04:56,920
I'm going to ruin your life.

1072
01:04:57,004 --> 01:04:58,629
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1073
01:04:59,837 --> 01:05:03,254
<i>As my tears flow endlessly.</i>

1074
01:05:03,962 --> 01:05:07,420
<i>Your love has cut me open.</i>

1075
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:12,254
<i>Our chords are now all broken.</i>

1076
01:05:14,379 --> 01:05:18,170
<i>My face won't hide behind a veil.</i>

1077
01:05:18,462 --> 01:05:22,587
<i>My soul has lived to tell its tale.</i>

1078
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:26,712
<i>You'll never know
You wouldn't care.</i>

1079
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:30,170
<i>Even if it breaks me
I'll still be there</i>

1080
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:31,712
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1081
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,420
<i>As my tears flow endlessly.</i>

1082
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:40,629
<i>Your love has cut me open.</i>

1083
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,212
Hi, my baby! How are you?

1084
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,420
Good.

1085
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,920
What did you tell Ma?

1086
01:05:55,962 --> 01:05:58,004
That I'm going to the club
to meet some friends.

1087
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,170
- And she believed you?!
- Who cares?

1088
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:02,754
Am I not allowed to meet my own daughter?

1089
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:05,129
We live in a democracy, after all.
Take this.

1090
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,420
It's for you.

1091
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,462
I've got you some <i>patisa</i> as well.
Your favorite.

1092
01:06:08,545 --> 01:06:11,129
Thank you. I'll open it later.
Come, see the house first.

1093
01:06:11,212 --> 01:06:12,212
Yeah, sure.

1094
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:16,087
Nice!

1095
01:06:16,629 --> 01:06:18,129
You've done it up beautifully.

1096
01:06:19,962 --> 01:06:21,045
Calls for a celebration!

1097
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,170
Isn't it a bit too early for a drink?

1098
01:06:24,504 --> 01:06:26,004
Who cares?

1099
01:06:28,212 --> 01:06:30,795
Tonight, father and son
will bond over drinks.

1100
01:06:33,462 --> 01:06:34,462
Daughter.

1101
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,504
You're my son and daughter, both.

1102
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,920
What happened?

1103
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,420
Why do you look so sad?

1104
01:06:50,129 --> 01:06:51,129
You can tell me.

1105
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:53,212
I'm your papa.

1106
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:08,754
Why don't you stop going
to the gym for a few days?

1107
01:07:11,087 --> 01:07:12,837
It might help both of you.

1108
01:07:15,045 --> 01:07:16,462
Why must I always have to leave?

1109
01:07:18,129 --> 01:07:21,379
I left my school, my home, my city,
and now, I have to leave the gym.

1110
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:26,045
I don't want to run away anymore.

1111
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,629
I am what I am, and...

1112
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:33,295
I'm not ashamed of it.

1113
01:07:33,629 --> 01:07:35,212
Why should you be ashamed of it?

1114
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:38,087
In fact, you should be proud of yourself.

1115
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:40,587
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of my daughter.

1116
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:48,337
Only one thing worries me.

1117
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:54,004
You're fighting these
battles all by yourself...

1118
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:57,087
while I'm far off in Ambala,
unable to be there for you.

1119
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,795
You're always with me, Papa.

1120
01:08:00,879 --> 01:08:02,879
That's how I find the strength
to fight my battles.

1121
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:07,129
Enough fighting now.

1122
01:08:08,254 --> 01:08:11,879
I just want to see you happy now.

1123
01:08:13,545 --> 01:08:14,545
You will.

1124
01:08:15,045 --> 01:08:16,045
Very soon.

1125
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:20,045
Love you.

1126
01:08:22,129 --> 01:08:23,129
Love you too.

1127
01:08:36,754 --> 01:08:39,087
Hey, sweetie! Don't be stingy!

1128
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:42,504
May you get a beautiful wife!
Come on, now hand me a crisp note!

1129
01:08:46,295 --> 01:08:47,670
Hey, muscleman! What's up?

1130
01:08:49,712 --> 01:08:51,295
- Listen..
- Why are you following me?

1131
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:53,045
Will you have coffee with me?

1132
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,129
Look, hero! Take a hike! Scoot!

1133
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:58,712
Can we please just talk once?

1134
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,629
Stop annoying me! Get lost!

1135
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:03,920
I just want to talk to you, sister!
That's it!

1136
01:09:04,545 --> 01:09:06,545
It's a matter of life and death. Please?

1137
01:09:08,837 --> 01:09:09,837
Let's go.

1138
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:15,045
So, this is a love triangle...
Manu, Maanvi, and Manu.

1139
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:18,504
Look, buddy.

1140
01:09:18,962 --> 01:09:20,170
You like her, right?

1141
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:24,004
She cares for you, she looks after you.

1142
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:26,629
She shares your joys and sorrows.

1143
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:29,712
And you're happy when
you're with her, right?

1144
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:31,670
You have fun too.

1145
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:34,379
Right?

1146
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:35,962
What else do you want?

1147
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,629
Maanvi seems to be from a nice family.

1148
01:09:39,879 --> 01:09:44,337
And she's lucky to have got
her operation done at the right time.

1149
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,254
Then what's stopping you?

1150
01:09:49,754 --> 01:09:52,212
You think it's weird to fall
in love with a trans girl!

1151
01:09:53,462 --> 01:09:55,670
You know what Shakespeare said, right?

1152
01:09:56,462 --> 01:09:57,504
"What's in a name?

1153
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:02,295
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

1154
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:04,212
I'm a BA in English.

1155
01:10:05,337 --> 01:10:07,587
Here's my two cents in Hindi.
Take it or leave it.

1156
01:10:08,295 --> 01:10:09,545
Labels can take a hike.

1157
01:10:10,337 --> 01:10:12,295
Gay, bi, uni, trans...

1158
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:15,962
what difference does it make?
Love is love! To hell with the world!

1159
01:10:20,087 --> 01:10:21,087
I'll tell you what...

1160
01:10:21,712 --> 01:10:25,295
I know one doctor.
You just go and meet her.

1161
01:10:26,504 --> 01:10:30,254
The heck did I just see!
Meet, pick up the phone!

1162
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:45,212
<i>He was on a coffee date with a eunuch!
A eunuch!</i>

1163
01:10:45,295 --> 01:10:47,004
<i>I nearly died of shock!</i>

1164
01:10:47,379 --> 01:10:48,379
Oh, God!

1165
01:10:48,462 --> 01:10:52,004
I'm hot on her trail, sis.
I'll keep you posted.

1166
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:53,879
But where's Manu now?

1167
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:56,670
Riz-Jomo picked him up.
God knows where they're taking him.

1168
01:11:15,962 --> 01:11:17,545
My goodness! Meet!

1169
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:20,712
That's it! Stop the auto!

1170
01:11:22,087 --> 01:11:23,254
Yeah, I'm keeping watch.

1171
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:28,129
Meet, they're going
into a mental hospital!

1172
01:11:28,962 --> 01:11:32,462
Sis, Maanvi has also entered some clinic.

1173
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:33,879
What's going on, Meet?

1174
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:36,712
Why is everyone going to see doctors?
Find out!

1175
01:11:36,795 --> 01:11:37,795
<i>I'm on it, sis.</i>

1176
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:39,629
Hello, Mr. Munjal.

1177
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,129
How can I help you?

1178
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:10,129
- Maanvi, right?
- Yes.

1179
01:12:10,879 --> 01:12:11,879
How have you been?

1180
01:12:13,879 --> 01:12:16,004
Sushma, take her to Dr. Kaur.

1181
01:12:19,087 --> 01:12:20,087
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1182
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:28,629
You both are normal adults
and sexually compatible as well.

1183
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:31,837
But ma'am, she was a boy,
and I've seen those pictures.

1184
01:12:32,629 --> 01:12:37,670
Our minds determine our
gender, Mr. Munjal...

1185
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:38,920
not our bodies.

1186
01:12:39,337 --> 01:12:41,295
Maanvi may have been
born in a male body,

1187
01:12:41,379 --> 01:12:45,004
but in her heart, mind, and soul,
she was always a woman.

1188
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:48,087
God made a mistake,
and Maanvi corrected it.

1189
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:49,629
Simple!

1190
01:12:51,254 --> 01:12:54,045
Mission canceled, Meet!
I repeat, mission canceled!

1191
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,254
Fatty's in danger!
Just meet me at the gym!

1192
01:12:56,337 --> 01:12:57,337
<i>But what happened?</i>

1193
01:12:57,379 --> 01:12:59,587
Just meet me at the gym, goddammit!

1194
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,087
My head is spinning!

1195
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:02,962
God, help us!

1196
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:07,420
If you're interested, I can give you
literature about transgenders.

1197
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,712
But to be honest, Mr. Munjal...

1198
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:13,837
what you need now isn't
research material but courage.

1199
01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:17,920
The same courage that Maanvi displayed
when she took such a brave step.

1200
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,170
Manu.

1201
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:29,629
What's going on with you?

1202
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:31,754
What's going on?

1203
01:13:32,837 --> 01:13:36,087
You didn't think twice before flushing
our family's reputation down the toilet!

1204
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:40,087
If not me, you could've at least
thought about your grandfather.

1205
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:43,504
I don't want to miss out on anything
before I breathe my last.

1206
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,629
You can see what you want on social media.

1207
01:13:47,004 --> 01:13:48,004
Tell us.

1208
01:13:48,504 --> 01:13:50,545
Didn't you already know everything?

1209
01:13:50,879 --> 01:13:51,879
What?

1210
01:13:53,587 --> 01:13:56,629
You knew all about Maanvi, didn't you?

1211
01:13:57,712 --> 01:13:58,712
Speak up!

1212
01:13:59,045 --> 01:14:00,545
Answer Papa.

1213
01:14:01,295 --> 01:14:02,545
Did you really not know?

1214
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:05,504
So, you knew.

1215
01:14:06,129 --> 01:14:09,045
And you still went around
shamelessly romancing with that...

1216
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,004
that thing?!

1217
01:14:11,087 --> 01:14:14,004
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

1218
01:14:14,212 --> 01:14:16,295
Are you really comparing me with him?

1219
01:14:16,795 --> 01:14:19,962
If our country wasn't divided
by religion, I would've..

1220
01:14:20,045 --> 01:14:22,212
Stick to the topic, Papa.

1221
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:25,379
How is this Manu's fault?

1222
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:29,212
That witch must have seduced
him with black magic.

1223
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:32,545
No wonder my right eye has been
twitching ever since I saw her!

1224
01:14:33,212 --> 01:14:34,212
But never mind.

1225
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,129
We've sorted it all out now.

1226
01:14:36,504 --> 01:14:37,504
Manu!

1227
01:14:39,754 --> 01:14:41,170
What are you here for?

1228
01:14:41,962 --> 01:14:42,962
Actually...

1229
01:14:43,837 --> 01:14:45,045
the coach's been calling Manu.

1230
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:46,962
Why is your phone switched off?

1231
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,795
You're not going anywhere.

1232
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,087
Sit quietly at home.
We've organized a prayer meet for you.

1233
01:14:56,837 --> 01:14:57,837
Manu.

1234
01:14:58,712 --> 01:14:59,712
Manu!

1235
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:01,170
Manu!

1236
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:02,337
Manu, listen to me!

1237
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,379
Will you say something?
What happened?

1238
01:15:12,629 --> 01:15:14,837
Bro, the shit hit the fan.

1239
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,254
Maanvi...

1240
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:26,087
Come, we'll start with the class.

1241
01:15:26,379 --> 01:15:27,462
No one will move!

1242
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:30,670
What did you think?

1243
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,587
You'll speak fancy English,

1244
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:35,587
put lipstick and makeup,
wear fashionable clothes,

1245
01:15:35,837 --> 01:15:37,379
and we'll welcome you into our family?

1246
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:41,670
Did you think that a eunuch can
become the Munjals' daughter-in-law?

1247
01:15:43,295 --> 01:15:46,129
Adam in the sheets
and madam on the streets?!

1248
01:15:46,629 --> 01:15:47,629
Right?

1249
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:50,754
Students, let's.. We'll start the class.

1250
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,837
What class? What students?

1251
01:15:57,337 --> 01:15:59,379
Guys... what's going on?

1252
01:16:00,045 --> 01:16:01,045
Will you say something?

1253
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:02,920
What can they say?

1254
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,670
They own this gym,
not the whole colony!

1255
01:16:06,337 --> 01:16:09,379
This is a place for families
and decent folks! Got it?

1256
01:16:13,629 --> 01:16:15,504
Miss Maanvi, please don't go.

1257
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,420
Frankly, Maanvi,
we don't care about any of this.

1258
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,129
You should just cushion
your baby brother in a blanket.

1259
01:16:25,545 --> 01:16:26,962
Have you never seen a girl before?

1260
01:16:29,004 --> 01:16:30,962
All this happened and you just kept mum?!

1261
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,879
Man, the situation got too one-sided.

1262
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:34,887
- What could we have done?
- What do you mean?

1263
01:16:35,379 --> 01:16:37,920
- You should've thrown them out!
- They're your sisters, dude.

1264
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:44,480
<i>Did you think that a eunuch can
become the Munjals' daughter-in-law?</i>

1265
01:16:44,504 --> 01:16:45,795
Man, this video's gone viral.

1266
01:16:45,879 --> 01:16:48,462
<i>Adam in the sheets
and madam on the streets?!</i>

1267
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:50,212
Everyone's sharing it, man.

1268
01:16:52,504 --> 01:16:53,879
Sandy even commented on it.

1269
01:16:55,254 --> 01:16:56,754
Screw this. Don't read it.

1270
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,212
Read it, Riz. I want to hear it.

1271
01:17:01,587 --> 01:17:02,879
"Exposed at the gym!

1272
01:17:03,587 --> 01:17:06,337
Never judge a chick
by her cover, Munjal."

1273
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:09,962
He's also tagged Maanvi.

1274
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,212
He's written, "One and a half men!"

1275
01:17:15,837 --> 01:17:17,420
- Stop the car!
- What?

1276
01:17:18,087 --> 01:17:19,129
I said, stop the car!

1277
01:17:19,379 --> 01:17:22,587
- Bro, let's go and work out.
- Screw working out! Stop the car!

1278
01:17:24,962 --> 01:17:25,962
Manu, where..

1279
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:28,337
Where are you going, bro? Manu!

1280
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:30,379
The competition's tomorrow, man!

1281
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:32,629
Where are you going, bro?

1282
01:17:58,087 --> 01:17:59,212
Stop calling me!

1283
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:02,170
Who?

1284
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:03,712
Ajit who?

1285
01:18:05,462 --> 01:18:06,462
Yeah, tell me.

1286
01:18:07,087 --> 01:18:08,462
Yeah, I'm home. What's the matter?

1287
01:18:10,379 --> 01:18:11,379
What?!

1288
01:18:11,962 --> 01:18:12,962
When?

1289
01:18:14,004 --> 01:18:15,379
And you're telling me now?!

1290
01:18:17,587 --> 01:18:18,754
Which hospital is he in?

1291
01:18:30,462 --> 01:18:31,462
- Navjot.
- Yes?

1292
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,374
- That's our Manu, right?
- What happened? How's Papa?

1293
01:18:39,212 --> 01:18:40,545
The operation's underway.

1294
01:18:41,004 --> 01:18:42,004
Hello.

1295
01:18:42,962 --> 01:18:44,004
- Hi, Ajit.
- Hi.

1296
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:45,629
What did the doctors say?

1297
01:18:45,879 --> 01:18:48,545
It was a massive heart attack.
They had to operate urgently.

1298
01:18:48,754 --> 01:18:50,545
How did this happen all of a sudden?

1299
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:53,420
Everyone was together,
dancing and celebrating.

1300
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,045
Uncle drank a bit too much.

1301
01:18:55,379 --> 01:18:58,962
He suddenly felt a sharp pain
in his chest and collapsed.

1302
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:01,129
We immediately admitted
him to this hospital.

1303
01:19:01,254 --> 01:19:03,212
He's been in for two hours.
We just have to wait.

1304
01:19:03,295 --> 01:19:05,004
If Ajit wasn't around today...

1305
01:19:05,962 --> 01:19:07,545
God knows what would have happened!

1306
01:19:09,837 --> 01:19:10,837
Manu...

1307
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:13,629
you were such a handsome boy.

1308
01:19:15,254 --> 01:19:17,504
- What happened to you suddenly?
- My name is Maanvi.

1309
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:20,670
Manu's dead. Didn't Mom tell you?

1310
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,060
Yeah, don't worry.
I've packed everything.

1311
01:19:34,129 --> 01:19:35,712
If anything's left, I'll come by again.

1312
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:37,879
Yeah, okay. I'm on my way.

1313
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:39,087
- Okay, bye.
- Maanvi!

1314
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:43,795
Please let me speak to Maanvi once.
I'll do whatever you say then.

1315
01:19:44,129 --> 01:19:45,129
Where is she?

1316
01:19:45,504 --> 01:19:47,587
- Get lost before I thrash you!
- Hey!

1317
01:19:49,379 --> 01:19:50,379
Please, bro.

1318
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,337
Just help me this one time.

1319
01:19:53,004 --> 01:19:54,379
I'll be indebted to you for life.

1320
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,420
Please?

1321
01:20:01,712 --> 01:20:03,045
Here, dear. Coffee.

1322
01:20:05,212 --> 01:20:06,212
Hi, Auntie.

1323
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,587
Manu, you used to have
big biceps, didn't you?

1324
01:20:15,295 --> 01:20:16,337
What happened to them?

1325
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,219
I had them removed
and put them somewhere else.

1326
01:20:19,879 --> 01:20:23,420
Somewhere else? Where?

1327
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:44,129
<i>Did you think that a eunuch can
become the Munjals' daughter-in-law?</i>

1328
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:46,837
<i>Adam in the sheets
and madam on the streets?!</i>

1329
01:20:52,379 --> 01:20:53,379
Maanvi.

1330
01:20:57,504 --> 01:20:59,504
- How's Uncle?
- He's still in the OT.

1331
01:21:02,045 --> 01:21:04,837
He insisted on tagging along,
kept pleading like a puppy.

1332
01:21:05,254 --> 01:21:06,254
Maanvi...

1333
01:21:09,295 --> 01:21:11,313
- What the hell is he doing here?
- At least, hear him out.

1334
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:12,837
I don't want to! I've heard enough!

1335
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,837
- We'll sort it out later..
- I don't want to!

1336
01:21:17,004 --> 01:21:19,045
Hello, sir. I'm Manu.

1337
01:21:21,337 --> 01:21:22,337
Maanvi's friend.

1338
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:24,087
Hello.

1339
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,504
Hello, Grandma.

1340
01:21:27,295 --> 01:21:28,295
God bless you, son.

1341
01:21:29,587 --> 01:21:30,587
How's Grandpa?

1342
01:21:30,712 --> 01:21:33,004
He passed away in 1992, son.

1343
01:21:33,629 --> 01:21:35,837
I'm just living with his memories now.

1344
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,670
She's not with us.

1345
01:21:38,879 --> 01:21:39,879
She's another patient.

1346
01:21:43,629 --> 01:21:46,254
So, are you an old friend of hers?

1347
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:48,670
Of Maanvi's?

1348
01:21:50,004 --> 01:21:51,004
Yes, sir.

1349
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,170
Is Maanvi's father okay?

1350
01:21:54,712 --> 01:21:55,712
He'll be fine.

1351
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:58,754
The entire family's
here to look after him.

1352
01:22:01,212 --> 01:22:03,420
Only near and dear ones are allowed here.

1353
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,170
Thank you.

1354
01:22:39,462 --> 01:22:40,462
Who is this hulk?

1355
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:42,504
Is he a goon?

1356
01:22:43,379 --> 01:22:44,379
Or your boyfriend?

1357
01:22:44,795 --> 01:22:46,295
And that sidekick...

1358
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,045
is that a boy or a girl?

1359
01:22:49,379 --> 01:22:50,379
These are your friends?!

1360
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:52,879
Why are they here?

1361
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:56,670
It's a free country.
People can go wherever they want.

1362
01:22:57,712 --> 01:22:58,920
Maybe they care about me.

1363
01:22:59,795 --> 01:23:02,115
It's possible for someone
to actually care about me, right?

1364
01:23:02,295 --> 01:23:03,379
Stop playing the victim.

1365
01:23:04,795 --> 01:23:07,035
It's thanks to you that
your father is in this condition.

1366
01:23:08,337 --> 01:23:09,545
What do you mean?

1367
01:23:10,254 --> 01:23:13,004
He drinks so much out of worry for you.

1368
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,420
Wow.

1369
01:23:17,045 --> 01:23:19,545
How conveniently you've
shifted the blame on me!

1370
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:22,170
You should be in politics.

1371
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:23,337
That is the truth...

1372
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:26,087
whether you accept it or not.

1373
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:28,879
Now please leave.

1374
01:23:30,129 --> 01:23:31,712
And take these freaks with you.

1375
01:23:33,379 --> 01:23:35,379
I'm not going anywhere
until Papa's out of the OT.

1376
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:41,754
How much more will you embarrass us, Manu?

1377
01:23:43,045 --> 01:23:44,962
What's this flag
of honor that I must uphold?

1378
01:23:46,045 --> 01:23:47,545
Until when will you play this card?

1379
01:23:48,587 --> 01:23:51,254
You're too ashamed
to even call me by my name.

1380
01:23:52,837 --> 01:23:55,295
My name is Maanvi. Maanvi, Ma.

1381
01:23:58,087 --> 01:23:59,420
I'm your daughter.

1382
01:24:00,837 --> 01:24:04,504
- Not that you were born as one.
- I was always your daughter.

1383
01:24:06,504 --> 01:24:08,504
I didn't decide to be
a girl on a whim overnight.

1384
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,379
How many times do I need to explain,
how many doctors do I need to take you to?

1385
01:24:15,379 --> 01:24:19,712
I've always seen you as
the ultimate woman since I was a child.

1386
01:24:20,712 --> 01:24:22,254
I always looked up to you.

1387
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,712
I was starving for your affection.

1388
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,254
Would it hurt so much if only once...

1389
01:24:30,379 --> 01:24:34,170
you accepted me as your daughter?

1390
01:24:35,004 --> 01:24:38,545
Whether I'm a boy or a girl,
I'm your child, am I not?

1391
01:24:43,462 --> 01:24:45,337
Now stop shedding tears
and creating a scene.

1392
01:24:46,754 --> 01:24:48,087
Your father's already in the OT.

1393
01:24:49,837 --> 01:24:51,129
I don't want any more stress.

1394
01:24:58,629 --> 01:25:00,754
Hey... it's okay.

1395
01:25:03,462 --> 01:25:04,462
Don't worry.

1396
01:25:04,587 --> 01:25:05,587
Are you a bodyguard, son?

1397
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,045
No, I'm a sportsman.

1398
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:10,754
- I see!
- I run my own gym in Sector 35.

1399
01:25:11,129 --> 01:25:13,249
Your physique led me to think
that you're a bodyguard.

1400
01:25:13,712 --> 01:25:16,212
They're quite in demand these days, right?

1401
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:19,712
Even bodyguards are
becoming celebrities now.

1402
01:25:23,879 --> 01:25:24,879
Mrs. Brar.

1403
01:25:26,587 --> 01:25:27,795
The operation was successful.

1404
01:25:28,379 --> 01:25:31,795
He's still not out of danger. Therefore,
we've put him under observation.

1405
01:25:32,129 --> 01:25:33,212
Can we meet him?

1406
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:34,712
No. Not yet.

1407
01:25:35,337 --> 01:25:37,087
By the way, who's Maanvi?

1408
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:39,379
He keeps taking her name.

1409
01:25:39,879 --> 01:25:42,170
- Please call her if she's not around.
- She's right here.

1410
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,087
That's Maanvi, doctor.

1411
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:46,379
Brigadier Brar's daughter.

1412
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:47,545
- Okay.
- Come forward.

1413
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,045
- Hello.
- Hi.

1414
01:25:50,129 --> 01:25:52,545
You can go see him inside...
but from a distance.

1415
01:25:52,795 --> 01:25:54,045
And no talking please, okay?

1416
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:57,212
He needs complete and absolute rest.
Okay?

1417
01:25:57,795 --> 01:25:59,379
- Thank you, doc.
- You're welcome.

1418
01:26:00,045 --> 01:26:03,504
There's only one attendant allowed
with the patient at night.

1419
01:26:03,962 --> 01:26:05,587
So, the rest of you, please...

1420
01:26:08,754 --> 01:26:10,087
I'll stay here with Uncle.

1421
01:26:10,504 --> 01:26:11,920
- You all can go home.
- I'll stay.

1422
01:26:12,587 --> 01:26:14,170
No, it's alright. I can.

1423
01:26:14,379 --> 01:26:18,379
Ajit... I'm his only child. I'll stay.

1424
01:26:21,837 --> 01:26:23,545
Call us if there's any problem.

1425
01:26:25,337 --> 01:26:26,795
Don't try and be a hero on your own.

1426
01:26:26,879 --> 01:26:29,212
She's not alone. I'm here with her.

1427
01:26:29,962 --> 01:26:32,170
But why? Are you Shah Rukh Khan?

1428
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:35,504
No, sir. I'm her bodyguard.

1429
01:26:36,587 --> 01:26:38,712
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1430
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:46,879
Hey.

1431
01:26:48,045 --> 01:26:49,045
Do you want me to stay?

1432
01:26:49,545 --> 01:26:51,379
No, you go. I'll message you.

1433
01:26:52,045 --> 01:26:53,170
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1434
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:57,129
Should I take him away?

1435
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:00,545
I really don't care.

1436
01:27:01,462 --> 01:27:03,129
Okay, fine. Just take care, okay?

1437
01:27:09,129 --> 01:27:10,129
You'd better behave.

1438
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:04,879
Maanvi!

1439
01:28:05,504 --> 01:28:06,712
Maanvi, please listen to me.

1440
01:28:07,212 --> 01:28:08,212
Just two minutes!

1441
01:28:09,087 --> 01:28:10,295
I just came here to say sorry.

1442
01:28:11,295 --> 01:28:14,045
- Whatever my sisters did..
- Was unforgivable. What else?

1443
01:28:14,379 --> 01:28:16,295
You're right. It was unforgivable.

1444
01:28:17,504 --> 01:28:19,129
But I swear on my mother's soul...

1445
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,379
I didn't tell them anything.

1446
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,170
I know.

1447
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:25,337
You don't have the courage.

1448
01:28:27,087 --> 01:28:28,879
Go, focus on your competition.

1449
01:28:29,254 --> 01:28:30,254
It's tomorrow, right?

1450
01:28:30,754 --> 01:28:31,754
Then why are you here?

1451
01:28:32,879 --> 01:28:35,254
Go, train. Be a man. Be the G.O.A.T.

1452
01:28:35,712 --> 01:28:40,004
How can I claim to be the G.O.A.T when
I couldn't even protect your honor?

1453
01:28:40,295 --> 01:28:42,629
I can protect my own honor.

1454
01:28:43,629 --> 01:28:45,545
You wanted me out of your life, right?

1455
01:28:46,504 --> 01:28:47,504
I'm gone now.

1456
01:28:47,962 --> 01:28:49,254
Let's go our own ways.

1457
01:28:50,629 --> 01:28:52,349
- Don't say that, Maanvi..
- Leave me alone.

1458
01:28:57,837 --> 01:28:58,837
Thank you.

1459
01:29:10,504 --> 01:29:12,212
What do you want? Why are you here?

1460
01:29:12,462 --> 01:29:13,962
Where should I go?
What should I do?

1461
01:29:14,587 --> 01:29:16,427
My head's been spinning
ever since you told me.

1462
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,254
It's not my fault.
I'm from a government school.

1463
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:23,837
I had never even heard
the word "trans" before.

1464
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,087
It just hit me like a brick!

1465
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:29,629
It's not a small deal
for a guy like me, Maanvi.

1466
01:29:30,837 --> 01:29:31,962
It takes time to sink in.

1467
01:29:32,712 --> 01:29:35,272
But now, I understand that there's
nothing to be understood here.

1468
01:29:37,087 --> 01:29:40,170
All that matters...
is that I really like you, Maanvi.

1469
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:44,254
Very, very much.

1470
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,670
I used to be a boy.
Have you forgotten that?

1471
01:29:46,879 --> 01:29:49,646
That boy doesn't exist for me! I don't
even know him, I've never met him!

1472
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:52,670
The person you are today...
is the one I truly like.

1473
01:29:53,462 --> 01:29:55,420
You're bloody amazing the way you are.

1474
01:29:56,504 --> 01:29:57,879
In fact, you're the real G.O.A.T.

1475
01:29:58,504 --> 01:29:59,504
You're a rock star!

1476
01:30:02,795 --> 01:30:03,962
I really miss you.

1477
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,754
Everything feels pointless without you.

1478
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:12,004
Whether it's keto or training.

1479
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,712
I feel low all the time.

1480
01:30:15,629 --> 01:30:17,545
Even my biceps have shrunk. Look.

1481
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:21,337
These are just empty words.

1482
01:30:22,045 --> 01:30:23,938
You won't be able to hold
my hand and face the world.

1483
01:30:23,962 --> 01:30:25,379
No chance I'll let go of you now.

1484
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:28,545
Just one chance...
that's all I'm asking for.

1485
01:30:29,462 --> 01:30:30,462
People will taunt you.

1486
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:32,712
Your life may never be normal again.

1487
01:30:32,795 --> 01:30:33,795
Normal!

1488
01:30:34,545 --> 01:30:35,629
What's normal? Tell me!

1489
01:30:36,462 --> 01:30:37,837
You think my life's normal?

1490
01:30:38,879 --> 01:30:41,629
I'm over 32, and I'm still not married.

1491
01:30:41,962 --> 01:30:44,629
I had one long-term girlfriend who
ran off with the neighbor's son!

1492
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:48,629
My father's having a secret affair.
I have two batshit, crazy sisters.

1493
01:30:50,129 --> 01:30:52,837
I have pimples on my chest,
thanks to all those protein supplements!

1494
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:54,795
Normal?

1495
01:30:55,212 --> 01:30:56,795
Normal is just a matter of perspective.

1496
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:58,712
Normal can go screw itself!

1497
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,004
Sorry, I got carried away.

1498
01:31:05,295 --> 01:31:06,587
All I want to say is that...

1499
01:31:10,129 --> 01:31:11,670
I really like being with you.

1500
01:31:13,879 --> 01:31:14,879
That's what I feel.

1501
01:31:16,879 --> 01:31:17,879
Do you feel it too?

1502
01:31:21,587 --> 01:31:22,587
Yes...

1503
01:31:24,462 --> 01:31:25,462
or no?

1504
01:31:29,087 --> 01:31:30,087
Manu!

1505
01:31:35,045 --> 01:31:36,254
What have you come to say now?

1506
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:39,712
That if I don't leave
Maanvi, you'll disown me?

1507
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:42,837
I don't care. Try something new.

1508
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:44,170
You disgrace!

1509
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,920
For the sake of your mother's soul...

1510
01:31:46,795 --> 01:31:47,962
get inside the car right now!

1511
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,170
That's my boy! Come on!

1512
01:31:52,629 --> 01:31:55,212
Better late than never!

1513
01:31:55,379 --> 01:31:57,254
We'll find you an original girl.

1514
01:31:57,754 --> 01:31:59,074
We don't want a Chinese knockoff.

1515
01:31:59,129 --> 01:32:00,920
Damn right! Come, let's go home!

1516
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:08,920
- Manu!
- Manu!

1517
01:32:09,004 --> 01:32:10,712
Manu, stop! Manu!

1518
01:32:11,629 --> 01:32:13,670
- Oh, my God!
- Hey! Manu, stop!

1519
01:32:13,795 --> 01:32:15,379
Go home and watch your daily soaps!

1520
01:32:15,462 --> 01:32:16,920
- Dad!
- Read your gossip magazines!

1521
01:32:17,337 --> 01:32:21,545
Gorge on crackers and pickles!
Let loose and make merry!

1522
01:32:21,962 --> 01:32:23,795
But for God's sake,
leave me alone!

1523
01:32:23,879 --> 01:32:24,879
What are you..

1524
01:32:27,337 --> 01:32:29,170
This whole family is bloody cursed!

1525
01:32:29,754 --> 01:32:31,087
What the hell is your problem?

1526
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:35,087
Weren't you all floored by Maanvi before?
Like, she was covered in gold dust!

1527
01:32:35,295 --> 01:32:37,295
Beautiful, classy,
well-spoken, and all that.

1528
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:39,004
And now, suddenly, she's rotten?

1529
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:41,962
You'll ruin your life, Manu!

1530
01:32:42,045 --> 01:32:43,879
It's my life, I'll figure it out!

1531
01:32:44,087 --> 01:32:45,087
What do you mean?

1532
01:32:45,337 --> 01:32:47,504
Do your family and its blessings
count for nothing?

1533
01:32:47,879 --> 01:32:49,129
You want to talk about family?

1534
01:32:49,587 --> 01:32:51,587
Grandma had a mustache.
She was family too, right?

1535
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:53,587
Did you stop loving her?

1536
01:32:55,295 --> 01:32:56,462
Go, Papa.

1537
01:32:57,879 --> 01:32:59,254
Go, live your life.

1538
01:33:00,045 --> 01:33:02,962
You're 55 already.
You won't get another chance.

1539
01:33:04,129 --> 01:33:06,004
Love is love, goddammit!

1540
01:33:07,587 --> 01:33:08,712
Go, bring our new mom home.

1541
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:11,962
New mom?!

1542
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,587
No one's stopped you.
You're just stopping yourself.

1543
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:17,295
Papa, don't even think about it!

1544
01:33:17,545 --> 01:33:19,337
We're already a laughing stock.

1545
01:33:19,504 --> 01:33:21,004
Our home will turn into a circus!

1546
01:33:21,962 --> 01:33:23,545
Papa... what are you thinking about?

1547
01:33:23,962 --> 01:33:25,212
Do me a favor.

1548
01:33:26,587 --> 01:33:27,587
Catch a rickshaw.

1549
01:33:27,795 --> 01:33:28,795
- What?
- What?

1550
01:33:28,879 --> 01:33:31,337
- Get off!
- Fine! Come on, Meet!

1551
01:33:31,754 --> 01:33:35,420
Come on, Meet. Papa's also lost it.
Now, it's all in our hands.

1552
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:39,063
- Let's go.
- But what should we do?

1553
01:33:39,087 --> 01:33:41,087
We'll talk to Grandpa, what else!

1554
01:33:41,379 --> 01:33:44,337
She is going to create a rift
in our family, I'm telling you!

1555
01:33:44,962 --> 01:33:45,962
Maanvi.

1556
01:33:50,545 --> 01:33:52,629
I've got to go.
I have to be with Papa.

1557
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:16,670
<i>Life's no good without you beside me.</i>

1558
01:34:18,254 --> 01:34:23,087
<i>Your absence leaves a void inside me.</i>

1559
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:30,379
<i>Come to me this instance.</i>

1560
01:34:31,212 --> 01:34:35,962
<i>I can't bear this distance.</i>

1561
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:39,587
<i>I bow at your feet.</i>

1562
01:34:40,004 --> 01:34:42,795
<i>With folded hands</i>

1563
01:34:43,129 --> 01:34:48,962
<i>I lie in your wake.</i>

1564
01:34:50,004 --> 01:34:53,045
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1565
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:55,962
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1566
01:34:56,337 --> 01:34:59,212
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1567
01:34:59,462 --> 01:35:02,420
<i>I'm a changed man, you'll see</i>

1568
01:35:02,795 --> 01:35:05,670
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1569
01:35:05,962 --> 01:35:08,795
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1570
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,962
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1571
01:35:12,295 --> 01:35:15,379
<i>I'm a changed man, you'll see.</i>

1572
01:35:27,045 --> 01:35:30,754
<i>Your heart is clear as water.</i>

1573
01:35:30,837 --> 01:35:33,920
<i>So pristine and pure.</i>

1574
01:35:34,004 --> 01:35:37,629
<i>Yet, I never looked within.</i>

1575
01:35:38,004 --> 01:35:40,795
<i>Couldn't understand your soul</i>

1576
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:46,795
<i>I was hypnotized
By your kohl-stained eyes.</i>

1577
01:35:47,587 --> 01:35:50,379
<i>But I never looked inside.</i>

1578
01:35:50,712 --> 01:35:53,837
<i>Never looked into your soul.</i>

1579
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:59,962
<i>Should've known from the start.</i>

1580
01:36:00,587 --> 01:36:05,254
<i>That I can't bear to be apart.</i>

1581
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:09,254
<i>I bow at your feet.</i>

1582
01:36:09,587 --> 01:36:12,379
<i>With folded hands</i>

1583
01:36:12,712 --> 01:36:18,670
<i>I lie in your wake.</i>

1584
01:36:19,545 --> 01:36:22,379
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1585
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:25,504
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me.</i>

1586
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,795
<i>I'm sorry, please forgive me</i>

1587
01:36:29,004 --> 01:36:31,795
<i>I'm a changed man, you'll see.</i>

1588
01:36:31,879 --> 01:36:33,295
GREATEST OF ALL TIME
2019-2020

1589
01:36:33,379 --> 01:36:35,087
Ladies and gentlemen!

1590
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:39,629
Here's the moment which you've all
been waiting for with bated breath!

1591
01:36:39,962 --> 01:36:42,254
It will be decided on this stage today...

1592
01:36:42,587 --> 01:36:45,170
who is Chandigarh's strongest,

1593
01:36:45,379 --> 01:36:48,920
most powerful champion!

1594
01:36:49,337 --> 01:36:52,795
So, give a big round of applause...

1595
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:56,129
to welcome the Tigers of Chandigarh!

1596
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:01,254
Astral Pipes presents,
"Greatest of All Time!"

1597
01:37:01,754 --> 01:37:06,712
G.O.A.T, 2019-20!

1598
01:37:11,504 --> 01:37:13,962
Hey, where's your third musketeer?

1599
01:37:14,045 --> 01:37:16,005
- Must've run off with Mister Zumba!
- Hey, you...

1600
01:37:20,754 --> 01:37:22,420
There he is!

1601
01:37:24,295 --> 01:37:26,670
Clap your hands for our lovesick Romeo!

1602
01:37:27,712 --> 01:37:29,879
Look at him praying!
It's of no use!

1603
01:37:29,962 --> 01:37:30,962
So, here we go.

1604
01:37:31,337 --> 01:37:33,629
It's time for
the competition's first round.

1605
01:37:33,962 --> 01:37:36,087
Rope Climbing and Box Jump!

1606
01:37:36,337 --> 01:37:39,087
All our contestants are ready to roar.

1607
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:43,629
And here comes Chandigarh's pride...

1608
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:47,212
who has proved his mettle...

1609
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:50,420
by winning G.O.A.T twice, back-to-back,

1610
01:37:50,962 --> 01:37:55,462
Sandeep Kasaana aka Sandy!

1611
01:37:55,795 --> 01:37:59,587
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

1612
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:03,795
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

1613
01:38:06,212 --> 01:38:07,629
Come on, Manu! Keep it up!

1614
01:38:26,545 --> 01:38:31,670
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

1615
01:38:35,712 --> 01:38:38,254
Only eight players have left on the field.

1616
01:38:38,337 --> 01:38:43,379
And Sandy seems to be in
the mood for a killer follow-up.

1617
01:38:56,629 --> 01:38:57,712
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

1618
01:38:58,962 --> 01:39:00,504
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1619
01:39:00,754 --> 01:39:04,129
Be ready for your heart
to race, as round two begins.

1620
01:39:04,379 --> 01:39:06,629
Sled Pull and Farmer's Walk.

1621
01:39:09,212 --> 01:39:11,045
Wow! What a performance!

1622
01:39:11,629 --> 01:39:17,420
What a remarkable union of
focus, confidence, and sheer strength!

1623
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:22,420
To give Sandy a tough fight...

1624
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:25,129
comes our two-time runner-up, Manu Munjal!

1625
01:39:25,795 --> 01:39:30,587
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

1626
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,920
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

1627
01:39:38,545 --> 01:39:42,045
And Sandy proves his mettle yet again!

1628
01:39:54,587 --> 01:39:59,212
Now that I've seen you two together,
all my blockages have cleared out.

1629
01:40:00,379 --> 01:40:03,295
SISTER-IN-LAW... HE NEEDS YOU.

1630
01:40:05,212 --> 01:40:07,712
Ma... will you stay here?

1631
01:40:08,754 --> 01:40:10,629
I might have to go for a bit.

1632
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:14,379
Don't worry, Maanvi.

1633
01:40:15,754 --> 01:40:16,837
I'm here.

1634
01:40:37,879 --> 01:40:39,045
And come back soon.

1635
01:40:40,837 --> 01:40:43,545
I can't handle your father alone anymore.

1636
01:40:45,045 --> 01:40:46,587
I'll be back in a jiffy.

1637
01:40:57,045 --> 01:40:59,962
I don't know. I'm not thinking.
How far are you, Akshita?

1638
01:41:01,212 --> 01:41:03,295
It's time for the third round to begin!

1639
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,087
Tire-flip and Hand-stand push-ups!

1640
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:26,379
Look, Sandy has finished the tire flips
and started his push-ups already.

1641
01:41:26,462 --> 01:41:29,629
Manu Munjal is still lagging.
Will he complete this round in time?

1642
01:41:37,754 --> 01:41:39,337
Hey, sissy-lover!

1643
01:41:39,545 --> 01:41:42,212
Don't forget to get a picture
with the winner this time!

1644
01:41:43,212 --> 01:41:48,129
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

1645
01:41:51,795 --> 01:41:54,587
All the boys have performed brilliantly...

1646
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:57,212
but let's take a look at the scores!

1647
01:41:57,462 --> 01:42:00,337
There are only three contenders left.

1648
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:04,795
Maintaining the top position
is Sandeep Kasaana,

1649
01:42:04,879 --> 01:42:09,254
trailing close at
the second position is Vicky...

1650
01:42:09,337 --> 01:42:12,712
and at the third position, Manu Munjal.

1651
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:19,337
Watch it, you freak!

1652
01:42:24,379 --> 01:42:26,420
And now, we're at the last
stage of the competition.

1653
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:28,545
The moment of reckoning!

1654
01:42:29,004 --> 01:42:33,004
The toughest and final round...
Clean and Jerk!

1655
01:42:33,587 --> 01:42:35,670
Lifting a weight of 140 kilos!

1656
01:42:36,254 --> 01:42:39,504
Five kilos more than his previous record!

1657
01:42:40,879 --> 01:42:43,212
If he manages to pull this off,

1658
01:42:44,129 --> 01:42:46,879
it will be a new record for India.

1659
01:42:47,212 --> 01:42:51,254
Set out to carry the nation's weight on
his shoulders is the champion, Sandy!

1660
01:42:53,712 --> 01:42:55,754
Come on, Sandy! You can do it!

1661
01:42:58,962 --> 01:42:59,962
Come on!

1662
01:43:04,087 --> 01:43:05,254
Come on, Sandy!

1663
01:43:17,045 --> 01:43:18,920
The tiger, the king... Sandy!

1664
01:43:19,629 --> 01:43:22,920
The undefeated champion of this stage!

1665
01:43:23,212 --> 01:43:27,129
It would take a miracle to defeat him!

1666
01:43:34,754 --> 01:43:35,754
Take this.

1667
01:43:37,212 --> 01:43:38,379
- Love you!
- Bye.

1668
01:43:47,045 --> 01:43:49,837
And Vicky comes crashing down!

1669
01:43:49,962 --> 01:43:52,129
Another one bites the dust!

1670
01:43:52,879 --> 01:43:54,545
He walks away, disappointed.

1671
01:43:55,129 --> 01:43:56,712
Oh, wow!

1672
01:43:56,879 --> 01:43:58,629
Hey, loser! Your she-male is here!

1673
01:43:58,712 --> 01:43:59,712
...Manu Munjal!

1674
01:44:14,337 --> 01:44:16,379
If he manages to break Sandy's record,

1675
01:44:16,462 --> 01:44:21,295
he can still win the G.O.A.T title.

1676
01:44:25,087 --> 01:44:29,712
Manu Munjal arrives on stage.
Armed with renewed determination.

1677
01:44:53,462 --> 01:44:55,712
Look at that newfound confidence!

1678
01:44:56,295 --> 01:44:59,337
Five kilos more are
being added to the bar.

1679
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:04,879
Looks like he's going to move mountains.

1680
01:46:38,712 --> 01:46:41,254
I can't believe my eyes!

1681
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:45,670
Manu Munjal stands strong...

1682
01:46:45,754 --> 01:46:49,295
with 150 kilos on his shoulders!

1683
01:46:49,962 --> 01:46:54,545
What a moment! This boy is on fire!

1684
01:47:01,712 --> 01:47:05,462
Manu Munjal, all the way!

1685
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:09,420
Looks like Sandy's pretty pissed.

1686
01:47:10,295 --> 01:47:15,295
Manu Munjal really knocked
his opponents for a loop!

1687
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,462
One hundred fifty kilos...
it's a new record for India!

1688
01:47:18,754 --> 01:47:20,754
And with that, he becomes...

1689
01:47:20,837 --> 01:47:25,254
this year's mighty champion!

1690
01:47:29,337 --> 01:47:34,629
<i>My heart's made a pact with yours.</i>

1691
01:47:35,545 --> 01:47:42,462
<i>And our love will see us through.</i>

1692
01:47:44,837 --> 01:47:51,295
<i>No matter what tomorrow holds.</i>

1693
01:47:51,795 --> 01:47:58,754
<i>Today, I give myself to you.</i>

1694
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:01,170
Now, tell me.

1695
01:48:02,254 --> 01:48:03,254
Yes...

1696
01:48:04,087 --> 01:48:05,087
or no?

1697
01:48:11,379 --> 01:48:14,837
<i>Chandigarh's falling in love.</i>

1698
01:48:16,337 --> 01:48:17,337
<i>O Chandigarh.</i>

1699
01:48:18,795 --> 01:48:19,795
<i>O Chandigarh.</i>

1700
01:48:21,295 --> 01:48:22,295
<i>O Chandigarh.</i>

1701
01:48:23,754 --> 01:48:24,754
<i>O Chandigarh</i>
