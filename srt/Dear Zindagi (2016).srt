1
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,453
Priya, listen to me

2
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,654
Let go of me

3
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,564
You always do this,
it's always other women

4
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,122
I didn't mean to hurt you

5
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,966
Every time you say the same thing

6
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,128
You know how much I love you

7
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,670
Please, listen to me

8
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,234
I love you so much

9
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,167
Cut!

10
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,707
Kaira, good for you?

11
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,670
Guys we'll do one more

12
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,435
We got this shot right?

13
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,744
We are running out of time, we don't
have permission for the whole day...

14
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,112
Kaira has a nice idea,
we'll do one more

15
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:54,610
What's the point of finishing
on time if we don't get a good shot?

16
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,483
Look, no respect for producers

17
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,055
Especially these new
cameramen... sorry... women

18
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,353
Come on, hurry up, let's do this!

19
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,395
Fatima, we are going to change the guy

20
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,453
You want the other guy?

21
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,396
He's got to look a little sexy

22
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,597
Get the camera

23
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,451
Cut!

24
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,319
Got that?

25
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,623
Fantastic!

26
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,626
Superb execution!

27
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,357
Good shot

28
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,026
I shot it at 48 frames,
speed up the end if you like

29
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,850
I'm going to take a
plate of the building now

30
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,595
Saw the shot Raghuvendra?

31
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,804
That one expression of the girl
checking out the passing guy says so much

32
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,410
I wish I had met Kaira earlier, I
would have shot the whole film with her

33
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,708
I got that

34
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,250
It's a wrap guys! Thank you!

35
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,051
Told you, don't have to carry my bag

36
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,060
I'm so sorry

37
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,432
Your mom called on
my cellphone earlier...

38
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,265
you never pick up yours...

39
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,038
please call her back,
before you take off

40
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,532
I will, you enjoy your mini holiday

41
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,013
You could have enjoyed
Singapore with us...

42
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,539
but you wanted to
fly with someone else

43
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,514
Shut up

44
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,051
Go go

45
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,056
I tried to upgrade you, couldn't do it

46
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,217
Please

47
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,755
Hi guys what can I get for you?

48
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,194
Beer
- Coke

49
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,752
Just Coke?

50
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,424
I drink only on two occasions,
when I am in love and when I am not

51
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,726
<i>Okay...</i>

52
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,635
Cheers!

53
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,570
Kaira, everything okay?

54
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,512
As in we're good right?

55
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,552
What are you talking about,
what happened to us?

56
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,716
Cheers!

57
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:21,999
Raghuvendra, I want to
shoot an entire feature film...

58
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,596
enough of this patchwork

59
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,661
I mean I can't keep waiting
for other cameramen to fall ill...

60
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,172
no one will even know
that I've shot this scene

61
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,732
I want to shoot my own film

62
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,032
You will

63
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,741
Who wouldn't want to work
with a hot DOP like you?

64
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,004
Hot!

65
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,081
Is that my only talent, seriously?

66
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,278
Seriously

67
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,713
Don't talk to me

68
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,415
Of course you're talented...

69
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,221
You are shooting so many
ads... earning good money

70
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,784
Ads and all are fine

71
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,757
I want to shoot a film

72
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,162
You will, you will, soon

73
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,134
And you're so young, I mean...

74
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,761
you wear zero number
glasses to look older

75
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,161
Excuse me?

76
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:04,232
If actresses can be at their peak at
a young age then why not technicians?

77
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,642
Have you heard of the word 'Patience'?

78
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,974
No I haven't, tell me about 'Patience'

79
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,280
Pick up...

80
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,253
pick up the cook's call...

81
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,720
if you want I can
just go and come back

82
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,689
He is not a cook,
he is the owner of a restaurant

83
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,696
Not even a cook?

84
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,365
That shot was your idea right?

85
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,701
Girl with guy, checking out other guy?

86
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,770
Inspired from life?

87
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,503
Listen Kaira...

88
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,376
you take my seat, I'll take yours...

89
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,677
I can sit in Economy class,
no need to sacrifice

90
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,585
Your long legs won't
fit in there anyway

91
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:51,579
That is true

92
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,646
It is very true

93
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,760
Yes Mom, it was good

94
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,332
Can't talk now,
the plane is going to take off

95
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,422
Bye!

96
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,507
So...

97
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,704
can I come up?

98
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,543
I'm really tired

99
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,603
Dinner?

100
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,550
I'm busy, but I'll see you

101
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,389
Alka!

102
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:04,519
<i>Didi! (Sister)</i>

103
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,954
You've become so fat!

104
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:10,957
L-low was your flight'?

105
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,278
Your mother called 3 times

106
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,719
You are so sweet Alka

107
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,326
Thank you!

108
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,361
Do you want coffee
or shall I serve breakfast?

109
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,189
Later

110
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,203
Didi...

111
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,274
this guy is so cute

112
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,272
Was cute!

113
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,107
Was!

114
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,582
I don't find him cute anymore...

115
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,177
just take down his photo

116
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,562
I just put it all in perfect order

117
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,029
Now it's perfect

118
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,255
So then, how was your trip'?

119
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,623
It was good

120
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,658
Just good?

121
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,500
Okay, great

122
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,507
You look beautiful sweetheart

123
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,285
Sorry, I'll just...

124
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:18,092
No it's okay, go ahead

125
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:20,530
Table for 4 please?

126
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,124
I'm sorry guys,
we have a strict dress code

127
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,396
No shorts and slippers please

128
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,233
Come on, it's his birthday

129
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,431
I'm sorry, wish I could

130
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,369
But she's wearing shorts!

131
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,569
It's okay for girls, I'm sorry guys

132
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,223
Just this once, only for you

133
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,464
Next time I'll come along
on shoot with you, as your caterer

134
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,464
What do you say?

135
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,006
I slept with Raghuvendra

136
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,162
I should go...

137
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,578
Sid...

138
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,088
I'm sorry

139
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,123
What are you doing!

140
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,240
It's all good!

141
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,512
It's okay, it's all good...

142
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,717
Hey look, Sid!

143
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,323
Shit! Where?

144
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,458
That's not Sid, Jackie

145
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,692
He looked so much like him... cute

146
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,662
Poor thing, nice guy he was

147
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,331
Really nice

148
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,739
Little too nice for you right?

149
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,617
Oh my God! This jacket!

150
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,021
It reminds me of school,
our 'Famous Five' gang

151
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,621
Was that the 8th or 9th grade?

152
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,988
10th grade, same one

153
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,528
See, I can have a long
term relationship too

154
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,257
Yes, with things

155
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,198
So are we things too?

156
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,291
Yes, you are a thing

157
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:18,660
Sorry

158
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,501
Have you gone blind in love?
Am I invisible?

159
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:22,734
We said sorry

160
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:26,704
Staring into her eyes!

161
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:27,711
They are a couple

162
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:30,647
'Oh my coochie coo'
'So sweet I love you'...

163
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,184
The same rubbish crap it's irritating

164
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,651
What are you doing?

165
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,717
Go to hell!

166
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,056
Stupid! Hate couples!

167
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,134
Are you guys here to help
me or to do a comedy show?

168
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,101
Both

169
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,265
Guys I have a deadline, I have
to show the director the costumes

170
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,467
Fine

171
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,336
Raunak do you need help?

172
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,107
Listen, I've to go,
I have my 'BD' appointment

173
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,307
What's this 'BU?

174
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,111
'Brain Doctor', my therapist

175
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:08,153
Oh 'BD'... Raunak you're
still going to that 'BU?

176
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,084
I have to

177
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,680
'Brain Doctor'?
Why are you seeing a therapist?

178
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:12,745
Are you mad?

179
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,185
Who isn't? Look at him

180
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,503
That's a cut, nice

181
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:28,564
Good for you Kaira?

182
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:29,699
Good for me

183
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,570
<i>Rubbish I
can direct better than this!</i>

184
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,019
Tell me something...

185
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:55,390
Why did you start
seeing your therapist?

186
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,603
So that you could
tell everyone you're gay?

187
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:02,369
<i>No</i>

188
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:07,105
So that I could tell myself, I'm gay

189
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,248
When is your flight to Goa?

190
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,757
Don't remind me I can't
believe I'm going to Goa

191
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,222
You're the first human
being who's saying this so sadly

192
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,725
It's Goa! Enjoy

193
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,353
Shut up

194
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,760
And yes it is sad...

195
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,535
Because I'm going on duty

196
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,501
Every 2-3 months
have to go show my face

197
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,773
Raghu?

198
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,269
Duty!

199
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,575
Yes mom, I'm coming tomorrow

200
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:45,046
What's with this food every time!

201
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:49,314
Make what you like,
don't ask me I'm busy

202
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,715
Mothers! Same standard
question every time...

203
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,489
'What will you eat' 'What to make'

204
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,497
Either she isn't my real
mother or she's had a memory loss

205
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:00,361
Kaira!

206
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,525
At least eat my food...

207
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:04,500
Only way to handle the torture...

208
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,266
I think this time I'll
work on my short film

209
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,465
Short film

210
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,067
The longest project of this century

211
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,076
That's so bitchy

212
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:13,668
It's true

213
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,611
l-low do you like my French food'?

214
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,409
Landlord? I'm not answering

215
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,213
I don't know about French
food but this dip is amazing

216
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,254
Full Indian spice, try it

217
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,018
The dip is from Kaira's fridge
I have made the puff pastries

218
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,519
Jackie, at last you made something

219
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,085
What do you mean, at last?

220
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,755
You film people think that
only you do important work...

221
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:36,592
and the rest of us are useless?

222
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,627
I have decided to work on myself

223
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,071
That's tough work

224
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,368
Don, do it

225
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,004
What's wrong with you?

226
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,274
I'm not going to Goa

227
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,144
Guess what?

228
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,444
'Raghu' your friend called...

229
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:56,283
and I have to shoot
a music video here in 3 days

230
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,151
Now get ready

231
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:57,585
Okay

232
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,352
I have never seen anybody
so excited not going to Goa

233
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,951
No Goa

234
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,491
What happened to her?

235
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:12,226
It's not because of my food

236
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,737
Okay everybody,
just get away from the table

237
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,304
This food is contaminated

238
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,435
<i>Hey Fats.</i> . <i>.you good?</i>

239
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,004
<i>Koko</i>

240
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,377
Yes

241
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,575
Guess what?

242
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,239
What's up?

243
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,546
I'm pregnant!

244
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,608
What?

245
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,350
It wasn't Jackie's food

246
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:33,984
Oh my God Fatty! Congratulations!

247
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:35,808
I mean we're supposed
to be happy right?

248
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:39,260
I don't know...
I want to throw up right now

249
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:45,234
Should I go?

250
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,292
Yes please

251
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,263
No I'm just kidding

252
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,039
I'm just very excited

253
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,642
Are you pregnant too?

254
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:56,311
So I was working on a co-production
with this New York film company...

255
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,708
and it has come through

256
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,008
Thank you

257
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,079
Wow, you are going to be
shooting a feature in the US?

258
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:04,645
Yes

259
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,253
Tell me more... good script?

260
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,018
Superb

261
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,288
Are you going to be
filming 'in' New York?

262
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,158
You are going to
be filming in New York

263
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,493
As in 'we' are going
to be filming in New York

264
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,135
If you're not available
we'll get another camera person...

265
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:21,298
Oh my God... l will kill you!

266
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,006
Told you, not going to Goa is lucky

267
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,246
Lucky for you, unlucky for me...

268
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,277
I want to kill my husband...

269
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,347
You're sure right?

270
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,616
It's not because
you think I'm hot right?

271
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,455
Obviously... you think
it's because you're talented?

272
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:45,420
What's wrong with your head?
Why are you so complicated?

273
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:47,466
You're the best,
that's why you got the job...

274
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,521
Simple

275
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:53,460
Thank you, appreciate it

276
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,472
<i>So let's break up</i>

277

00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,396
<i>Basically basically basically.</i> ..

290
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,129
<i>I</i> 'm a rascal

291
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,436
It's a wrap!

292
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,413
Hi mommy, congratulations!

293
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,043
Fatima the fatty!

294
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:57,186
Cute guy

295
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:58,490
So many men in your life

296
00:21:58,552 --> 00:21:59,087
Shut up

297
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,291
You'll also get to spend
time with Raghu also...

298
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:04,165
when you're in New York,
shooting for 3 months

299
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:06,033
Hello ladies, and one gent

300
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:06,766
Oh hello?

301
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,563
Oh sorry two gents

302
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:12,642
Can I steal Kaira for a minute?

303
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,441
Thief! Even we want to hear

304
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,037
What?

305
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,274
Even we want to hear!

306
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,180
What? I can't hear anything

307
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:25,316
Okay pose

308
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:29,091
Nice one

309
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,356
So I'm off to New York tonight

310
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:35,533
What?

311
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,589
Yes

312
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,771
The financiers want to meet urgently

313
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,239
Someone has to fly so that you can

314
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,105
OK go, fly...

315
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,739
Have a nice flight

316
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:51,804
That's it?

317
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,380
Have a nice flight?

318
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:55,809
What else do I say?

319
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,113
Say something

320
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,750
You pulled me here,
you say something

321
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:04,188
Firstly stop looking so hot

322
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,154
Tie your hair up

323
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,728
And behave yourself,
just for two weeks

324
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,336
Here you go, happy'

325
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:17,505
Very happy

326
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,474
l-low do I look'?

327
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,307
Lovely

328
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:25,208
So I had to talk to
you about something...

329
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,517
Do you want to hit the dance floor?

330
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:30,616
<i>Hi Justin Bieber</i>

331
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,515
We're just in the
middle of a conversation

332
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:39,558
Anyway, you were saying

333
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,497
I was saying that...

334
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:44,392
Gautam I...

335
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,127
Who?

336
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:48,399
Gautami Sharma will be
the line producer of the film...

337
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:50,401
OK, so?

338
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:53,768
The financiers have recommended her...

339
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,834
they think she is the
best person for this job

340
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,516
What are you trying to say?

341
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:04,113
Gautami and I, many years ago...

342
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:07,086
were in a relationship

343
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:11,558
Okay, it's a reunion! That's amazing

344
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:13,160
Reunion my foot...

345
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,665
It's going to be a
really awkward situation

346
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:18,635
I mean she was such a weird one...

347
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,365
I don't even feel like seeing her

348
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:26,505
I just want the job to go smoothly,
and I thought you should know

349
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,375
Cool, whatever

350
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,744
What Whatever'? Come here...

351
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:40,616
Anyway I've had someone else
on my mind for a while now

352
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,231
Look I think...

353
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:57,340
it's time that we got
serious about each other

354
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,405
I think it's time that you go

355
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,642
Do you want to miss your flight?

356
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,281
Kaira I'm serious, I'm not kidding

357
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:10,411
We really should...

358
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,629
We have a flight to catch...

359
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:19,721
It's late

360
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:21,659
Okay okay

361
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:25,999
Go, it's okay, it's cool

362
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,061
Really?

363
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:29,607
You don't have anything to say?

364
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:34,036
No, that's it for now

365
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:35,580
Bye

366
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:39,649
What did I miss?

367
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:40,742
Shots!

368
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,253
<i>So, let's break up</i>

369
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,222
<i>Oh my dear</i>

370
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,725
<i>Let's break up</i>

371
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:24,360
<i>Oh please say yes</i>

372
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:29,024
<i>You and I will never work out,
oh let me go</i>

373
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,518
<i>When I see</i>

374
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:49,577
<i>A beautiful girl</i>

375
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,287
<i>I get excited</i>

376
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,718
<i>Basically basically basically</i>

377
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,722
<i>I</i> 'm a rascal

378
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,025
<i>But you're no less baby</i>

379
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:05,732
<i>Somedays you're nice</i>

380
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,529
<i>Somedays you're crooked</i>

381
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:10,271
<i>Basically basically basically.</i> ..

382
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:13,675
You're a rascal too

383
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:42,105
Koko, why don't you think
seriously about Raghuvendra?

384
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:45,507
He is so right for you...

385
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:49,605
This is why some
people should not drink

386
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,580
Why should she think
about Raghuvendra?

387
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:53,413
Is he the last man in the world?

388
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,679
Why shouldn't she consider him?

389
00:27:56,143 --> 00:28:03,220
I will tell you point by point why
Raghuvendra is the perfect guy for Koko

390
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:06,192
Point no. 1...

391
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:09,162
And this is the most
important point in the world

392
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:12,096
He is good looking

393
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:17,668
Hardly two percent of people
in the world look good...

394
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:20,409
and if you have to spend
your life with somebody...

395
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:24,643
every morning you should
at least see a handsome face

396
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:26,646
Point no. 2...

397
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,582
He has a great sense of humour...

398
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:34,258
and more laughter means more sex

399
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:37,318
Where are you getting
this information?

400
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:39,658
Point no. 3...

401
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:44,063
He understands your profession

402
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:49,434
If you marry a software
engineer or a farmer...

403
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,601
what will you discuss at dinner?

404
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:54,043
Virus or cow dung?

405
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:56,081
Hello, my husband
is a software engineer

406
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,240
And we have many
interesting discussions

407
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:00,011
Like what?

408
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:01,585
Like a lot of things

409
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:04,122
And I'm sure farmers
are interesting too...

410
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,522
they can tell us
about organic vegetables

411
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,322
They can tell you
where to get cow's milk

412
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,152
Go, marry a farmer

413
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:14,528
Ganju, tell them I'm right

414
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,569
Yes, please give us
your male point of view

415
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:20,332
Guys, just shut up

416
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,031
This is all pointless

417
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:27,307
He's going to meet his
ex-girlfriend in New York

418
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:31,448
Ex-girlfriend! That's just great

419
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:35,679
Ex is an ex, that's in the past

420
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:36,613
Just punch her

421
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:40,284
No, the important question is...

422
00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:44,656
are you his present?

423
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,259
William Faulkner once said...

424
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:52,327
"The past is never dead,
in fact it's not even the past"

425
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:55,995
What?

426
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,136
Your 'BD' taught you this?

427
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:59,701
Hey I want to go to this 'BD'

428
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:28,229
<i>Raguu!</i>

429
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,437
Take it take it...

430
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:34,140
No I don't need it

431
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:37,512
<i>Stop acting pricey...
1 know you like Raguu</i>

432
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:39,811
No, I don't

433
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:45,823
Take it, keep it, very tasty so yum

434
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,320
Yuck Jackie, so cheap

435
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:51,586
<i>I love the taste of Raguu</i>

436
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,696
Have you gone mad?

437
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:57,365
Limited offer, grab now

438
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:00,169
You've gone mad

439
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,241
Pasta!

440
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,119
<i>No don 'I be so desperate,
let him call</i>

441
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,500
New photo?

442
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,768
Yes, nice?

443
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,278
Eat quickly, it will get cold

444
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,279
<i>Raguu Raguu Raguu.</i> ..

445
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:52,223
Just crush the blacks

446
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,225
More...

447
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:57,785
See...

448
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,463
Let's Play

449
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,232
Much better see...

450
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,502
Yes, it's looking nice

451
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:13,235
Okay now pause and zoom in

452
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:17,441
Ganju! I told you to remind me at 3 PM

453
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:20,041
I had to take Fatty to the doctor

454
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:24,120
Fatty! I'm so sorry, I'm just leaving

455
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:28,422
<i>No, you wait I'm coming there,
to eat the canteen Veda Pav</i>

456
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:30,484
My doctor's appointment got cancelled

457
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,296
This landlord...

458
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,229
Hello...

459
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,129
What?

460
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,573
You are not going to believe this

461
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:50,480
Being single is now a crime!

462
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:51,409
What?

463
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:55,079
My landlord is kicking
me out of my apartment!

464
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:55,820
What?

465
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:59,057
I'm going to join the
ranks of homeless in Mumbai

466
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:00,790
And you want to know why?

467
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,493
Did I damage the apartment? No!

468
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,426
Did I forget to pay rent? No!

469
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:07,227
The building committee
just got together and decided...

470
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,165
that only married couples
and families can live there

471
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:10,361
Is that even legal?

472
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,128
This just happened?

473
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,138
Yes he just called!

474
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,401
I've been avoiding his calls for days

475
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:19,307
Gosh Fatty, I have to vacate
by the end of the month...

476
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:20,242
I don't know what to do

477
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,007
Damn these people

478
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,049
Mumbai, India's most
modern cosmopolitan city

479
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,446
Seriously

480
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:31,456
Listen, you know you can stay with me

481
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,389
That's not the point

482
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,320
In a way, thank God...

483
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:43,258
thank God I'm leaving this city
and this country for this project...

484
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,265
But seriously what thinking

485
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:48,273
No marriage means no home for women?

486
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:53,741
Why don't they make this law instead 'no
staying with your in-laws after marriage'?

487
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,241
Forget it

488
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:04,178
So, when is the New York shoot?

489
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:05,582
I don't know

490
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,592
I will know the exact
dates in a month...

491
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:10,586
when the man returns

492
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:12,322
The man has not called?

493
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,100
Raghuvendra has not called?

494
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:16,457
<i>No</i>

495
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,068
What 'hmm'?

496
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:27,008
Why you looking so suspicious?

497
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,670
Fatty? Tell me

498
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,613
He got engaged

499
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,678
He got engaged!

500
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:39,383
I'm sorry, who got engaged?

501
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:42,389
Raghuvendra

502
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,288
When?

503
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:46,287
Last week

504
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:47,761
Last week?

505
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:52,559
He was just here,
I mean, he just left...

506
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:53,570
I know...

507
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:56,107
Who told you? How do you know?

508
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:58,369
Ajay, that guy from production...

509
00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:01,603
Just one second...
he's not even messaged...

510
00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:03,306
Who told you?

511
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,442
Ajay, from production,
he went to New York with Raghuvendra

512
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:08,384
He got engaged?

513
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:12,320
I don't believe this to whom?

514
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:14,620
Just please, one second, how can he'?

515
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:16,391
Koko...

516
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,691
God! This is just getting worse

517
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:41,142
You okay?

518
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,112
It's just the chilli

519
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,054
You want to know to whom?

520
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,123
<i>No</i>

521
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,545
Okay playback

522
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:33,196
Sorry it slipped

523
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:52,453
<i>Where do I go from here</i>

524
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:55,423
<i>Where do I hide</i>

525
00:36:56,116 --> 00:36:58,323
<i>This half heart</i>

526
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,363
How do <i>I</i> share?

527
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:04,333
<i>We parted from myself</i>

528
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:07,262
<i>Pm separated from myself</i>

529
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:10,234
<i>This half heart</i>

530
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:13,034
<i>How do I settle?</i>

531
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,707
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

532
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:22,410
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

533
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:28,384
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

534
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,392
<i>What's your problem</i>

535
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:36,497
<i>Oh heart, just go to he“</i>

536
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:43,768
<i>Just go to he“, Oh heart</i>

537
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:03,717
<i>Just go to he“, Oh heart</i>

538
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,359
I don't believe this

539
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,299
Back to Goa, back to square one

540
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,501
It's just for 1 month...

541
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:14,639
then the New York shoot will start...

542
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:16,996
won't it?

543
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:18,337
I don't know...

544
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,580
Personal and professional...

545
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:25,014
always keep it separate

546
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:26,583
You always say this

547
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,449
When will you ever use this?

548
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:31,189
Such strange things you buy

549
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,555
Damn, I have to live
with my parents for a month

550
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:35,321
l-low am I going to do it'?

551
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:37,151
Stay with me...

552
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:38,729
I'm also going to be in Goa

553
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:40,427
We'll do yoga together

554
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:43,525
Do yoga in your fancy holiday house...

555
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:47,537
I wish my parents would
buy me a villa in Goa

556
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:49,132
Guess what?

557
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:53,676
When I reach Goa, I have
to do a beautiful shoot for my dad

558
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,375
Uncle also joined the film business?

559
00:38:56,437 --> 00:38:57,711
No Jackie...

560
00:38:57,771 --> 00:39:01,241
he wants me to shoot a promotional
video for his friend's restaurant...

561
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:02,308
Who knows?

562
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:05,583
This could be the
turning point in my life

563
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,032
<i>Are you my fault</i>

564
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,469
<i>Or your own mistake</i>

565
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:22,468
<i>Shamed heart</i>

566
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,973
<i>Please tell me so</i>

567
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,544
<i>What do we gain now</i>

568
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:31,582
<i>What do we lose now</i>

569
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,518
<i>Shamed heart</i>

570
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:37,615
<i>Crying is no use</i>

571
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:40,625
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

572
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:49,490
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

573
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:55,063
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

574
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:58,110
<i>What's your problem</i>

575
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:01,738
<i>Oh heart, just go to he“</i>

576
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:04,081
So Koko

577
00:40:04,204 --> 00:40:06,013
Have you met 'Salman Khan' yet?

578
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,116
Oh my God, 'Sallu'!

579
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:11,154
Is he so handsome in real life?

580
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,656
Does he actually have a 6 pack?

581
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:16,183
Or is that just how
it looks on screen'?

582
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:19,054
Tell me Koko, I'm dying to know

583
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,094
First of all,
I haven't met your 'Sallu'...

584
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:22,463
and if I ever meet him...

585
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:23,466
I'm not going to tell him...

586
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:27,165
'Take off your shirt
I want to see your 6 pack abs'

587
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:28,227
Exactly

588
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,803
Tell us about your ad with 'Dhoni'

589
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:33,202
One second dad

590
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:39,718
'Salman Khan'? Abs? Really?

591
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:43,545
Stop bugging her...

592
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:46,789
talk about the main topic

593
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:54,124
Yes Ashu,
she should be doing a proper job...

594
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,629
in an office...

595
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,570
something more respectable

596
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,005
That's when we can talk to
people seriously about marriage

597
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:04,768
Why will she do some other job?

598
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:07,645
She's done a cinematography
course in New York

599
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:10,582
She is brilliant at her
job and she's still young

600
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,480
She won't be young forever...

601
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:15,019
all the good boys will be taken

602
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:17,077
That's my biggest worry you know...

603
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,380
come baby...

604
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:30,765
So Kaira, tell me...

605
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,399
Are you a...

606
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:36,371
Are you a Lebanese?

607
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:44,509
It's not Lebanese', it is lesbian!

608
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:51,087
Yes, are you a Lesbian'?

609
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh my God...

610
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:07,401
If I were, would that stop
you from talking about marriage?

611
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:11,475
Even if you are,
it won't make a difference...

612
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:14,203
all this gay stuff is
cool in the film industry

613
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:15,641
You're right...

614
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,206
from big stars to spot boys,
everyone's gay...

615
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,009
we call it 'Gollywood' now

616
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,244
Really?

617
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:22,678
Really?

618
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:24,586
Of course not!

619
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,016
Do you people even
listen to yourselves?

620
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:29,686
It's such rubbish

621
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:33,163
The film industry doesn't have more
gay people, it's just more accepting...

622
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:37,533
there must be many gay
people in your office too...

623
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:40,536
but sadly they have to hide the fact

624
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:47,142
So, are you?

625
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,571
A 'lesbo?

626
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:56,554
No, unfortunately not

627
00:42:57,611 --> 00:43:01,058
So why don't you settle down?

628
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,994
We're just worried about you Koko

629
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:07,025
If you keep hanging
with these filmy men...

630
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,134
how will you find a nice boy'?

631
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:14,102
Filmy men are okay for checking
out abs, but not okay to marry?

632
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,705
L-low much junk you Keep eating

633
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,077
I've made all this for you...

634
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:19,770
eat this

635
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,547
For me? Have you
ever seen me eat this?

636
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:26,241
<i>I thought you like paneer...</i>

637
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,153
you used to eat it...

638
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,424
that's why I keep
asking what you want...

639
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,153
anyway, dinner is put...

640
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:40,258
come baby, come...

641
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,139
You know Koko

642
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,703
getting married before 25...

643
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:59,681
can reduce the divorce rate by 50%

644
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:04,717
There is a 100% chance
of not getting a divorce...

645
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:07,592
by not getting married

646
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,650
I'm going to stay with Jackie

647
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:11,652
Koko?

648
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:24,266
<i>Pm addicted to pain</i>

649
00:44:24,631 --> 00:44:29,637
<i>Even my tears, laugh at me</i>

650
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:35,243
<i>Why do I give myself new scars</i>

651
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:41,685
<i>Somebody save me from myself</i>

652
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,629
What about the New York project...

653
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:35,380
What is this question,
'did you sleep well'?

654
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:37,347
If I say no what can you do?

655
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:39,716
I don't care what people think...

656
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:42,253
I'm not going to stay
with you for other people...

657
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:46,089
don't irritate me please

658
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,760
'Good morning' is it?

659
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:53,029
Now it's a 'good morning'...

660
00:45:53,621 --> 00:45:55,567
If your night is not good...

661
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:57,567
how will your morning be good'?

662
00:45:57,725 --> 00:45:59,534
I think I should
be a night watchman...

663
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:02,038
Should I take an
appointment with a doctor?

664
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,007
Who is that?

665
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:10,572
He moved here a few weeks ago,
to write...

666
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,273
Nice guy

667
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:15,417
Take an appointment with him

668
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:20,316
There she is, my talented daughter...

669
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,391
She shoots with all
'Bollywood' celebrities

670
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,650
Really?

671
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:26,732
I know this is a small job for you...

672
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:30,230
but this new restaurant
video is very important for us...

673
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,598
thank you so much for doing this

674
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:32,762
No, it's cool

675
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,506
Actually we should start,
the camera setup will take a while

676
00:46:35,562 --> 00:46:38,133
Yes, she is very professional

677
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:40,576
During work, only work, nothing else

678
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:41,634
Dad!

679
00:46:41,702 --> 00:46:44,012
Can we stop all these
useless formalities?

680
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:44,776
I need to get this done

681
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,416
I only have a day

682
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,113
Get the 24-70

683
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:51,554
Tried everything Ganju...

684
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:54,354
even sleeping pills, nothing works

685
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:58,255
Try 'Reiki'...
my grandmother also tried it

686
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,597
Shut up and setup

687
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:03,160
Remove all this,
what's all this rubbish...

688
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:10,067
I am sorry,
this can't be moved right now...

689
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,609
only after this session ends

690
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:12,665
What?

691
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,146
We have to wait? Then why call us?

692
00:47:15,202 --> 00:47:16,510
Ma'am, the session is going on

693
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:18,082
Madness!

694
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:21,477
National Convention for
Mental Health Awareness...

695
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:23,451
it's a festival for therapists...

696
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,320
Raunak's playground... should we go in?

697
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,087
Shut up and sit

698
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:32,092
Here?

699
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:33,153
Just sit

700
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:46,041
I've done a shot breakdown,
you want to see?

701
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:47,267
I'm sleeping

702
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:50,646
<i>Dr. Chopra,
therapy, counselling, analysis...</i>

703
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:52,206
<i>so many big terms...</i>

704
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:54,343
<i>what do they actually mean?</i>

705
00:47:54,742 --> 00:48:00,351
<i>A proper map can be drawn after defining
commonly accepted medical terms...</i>

706
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:04,328
<i>if your prob/em or illness
falls in those definitions...</i>

707
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:07,195
<i>your prognosis will
tell you your diagnosis</i>

708
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:11,599
<i>it will become clear whether you need
intensive therapy or counselling...</i>

709
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:14,563
<i>whether you need an
analyst or psychiatrist...</i>

710
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,003
<i>it's quite simple actually</i>

711
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:17,302
It's very simple

712
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:20,174
What are they talking
how to understand?

713
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:24,148
<i>Dr. Pereira, how does one decide which
type of doctor they should be going to?</i>

714
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:25,740
<i>A psychiatrist or</i> a <i>psychologist?</i>

715
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,581
<i>Each model has it's own
strengths and weaknesses.</i> ..

716
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:32,317
<i>Ah individual may find one approach
more appropriate than another...</i>

717
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,751
<i>depending on his
persona! preferences...</i>

718
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:37,757
<i>and the depth and severity
of the problem presented</i>

719
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,199
If I hear another minute of this...

720
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:42,364
I'll go nuts

721
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:43,993
<i>This question is for Dr. Khan</i>

722
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:48,503
<i>Dr. Khan, how do you know
if someone is crazy or normal?</i>

723
00:48:49,063 --> 00:48:49,302
What?

724
00:48:49,363 --> 00:48:50,637
Take me for example...

725
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:54,268
<i>many of you might
think that Pm crazy...</i>

726
00:48:54,735 --> 00:48:59,343
<i>I've come for this formal
seminar in these torn jeans...</i>

727
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:01,544
so, am <i>I</i> crazy?

728
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:07,385
<i>Or maybe all I need is</i> a <i>good stylist</i>

729
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:11,260
Crazy! Very scary word

730
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:13,591
Because here we still believe that...

731
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:17,392
a problem of the mind
is something to be ashamed of

732
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:20,468
If you have a problem with your body,
that's normal...

733
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:22,040
you can tell everyone...

734
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:25,170
'hey I'm in hospital...

735
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,312
with a kidney failure...

736
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:29,706
lung infection, jaundice'

737
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:32,644
But if it's a problem of the mind...

738
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:36,279
then the whole family goes silent...

739
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:40,049
hush hush hush...

740
00:49:43,684 --> 00:49:47,689
as if the mind is not
even a part of the body

741
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,567
Don't laugh just yet...

742
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,027
the joke begins now

743
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:56,533
Here in Goa,
my parents used to tell everyone...

744
00:49:56,764 --> 00:50:00,541
that I'm a gynecologist,
not a psychologist

745
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:04,046
Which means the doctor's
own family is ashamed...

746
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:07,683
to admit that their son is a therapist,
dealing with problems of the mind

747
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:09,520
Imagine my plight...

748
00:50:10,044 --> 00:50:17,485
many of my pregnant relatives landed
up at the clinic for a free check up...

749
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:21,495
and you know what,
I delivered a few babies too...

750
00:50:21,555 --> 00:50:23,728
for the extra pocket money

751
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:26,069
No, I'm just kidding

752
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:36,173
Dr. Jehangir Khan

753
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:13,316
Thank you

754
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,251
You'll close it please?

755
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:38,270
So I'm Jehangir Khan...

756
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:41,072
but you can call me '.Jug'

757
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:43,209
May I have a glass of water...

758
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,682
from that jug, Jug?

759
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:51,088
I'm sure you can
crack better jokes Kaira

760
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,725
May I call you Kaira?

761
00:51:54,782 --> 00:51:56,784
I have only one name

762
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:05,234
So, how does this work?

763
00:52:07,194 --> 00:52:09,674
I have no idea how that works...

764
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,403
you tell me

765
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:15,771
Can I lie down here?

766
00:52:16,036 --> 00:52:16,673
Why, are you sleepy?

767
00:52:17,004 --> 00:52:19,280
I'm not able to sleep

768
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,348
That's the reason I am here

769
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,589
Did you see a doctor?

770
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:26,214
Isn't that what I'm doing?

771
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:31,023
You mean the white coat,
stethoscope, pill-giving doctors...

772
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:33,463
I tried pills, they didn't work

773
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,090
That's why I'm here

774
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:41,401
Sometimes I use this to
knock my patients off to sleep

775
00:52:41,762 --> 00:52:43,105
You're funny

776
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:45,440
But, you need to work on your jokes

777
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:48,475
So tell me

778
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:54,145
Any major change in your life?

779
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,284
I just moved from Mumbai to Goa...

780
00:52:58,345 --> 00:52:59,345
is that a major change?

781
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,586
Yes that's a major change... and?

782
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:07,126
And nothing,
the moving out, the settling in...

783
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,733
Or the leaving, the unsettling?

784
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:13,403
No, that's not a problem for me...

785
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:16,404
I like to move,
not being in one place...

786
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:19,100
in fact I love to travel...

787
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,339
it's just this sleeping problem

788
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:26,276
So why did you move
from Mumbai to Goa'?

789
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,423
You know...

790
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,324
I came to Goa to be
with my best friend...

791
00:53:42,122 --> 00:53:44,625
she's having issues with this guy...

792
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:51,040
who she really likes,
really 'liked'...

793
00:53:51,098 --> 00:53:55,604
and she thought he liked her too...

794
00:53:55,669 --> 00:53:58,309
but then he suddenly
got engaged to someone else

795
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:02,146
So your best friend, is she okay now?

796
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,555
I don't think so...

797
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,186
I don't think she is okay

798
00:54:07,448 --> 00:54:11,487
I think her main problem
is her profession

799
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:15,159
She got this dream job,
which is linked to him...

800
00:54:15,222 --> 00:54:18,362
his new fiance will
also be on this project

801
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:20,996
So how will she handle that?

802
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:22,572
I don't know

803
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,140
What if everything gets messed up?

804
00:54:24,198 --> 00:54:27,008
I don't know what to advise her...

805
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:29,274
should she just deal with it?

806
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,516
It is her dream job after all

807
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:33,381
Sometimes I feel I should tell her -

808
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:35,317
'Grit your teeth and just do it...

809
00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:38,516
you won't get another
opportunity like this'

810
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:40,181
And sometimes I feel I should say -

811
00:54:40,247 --> 00:54:41,555
'Shut up! And say no!

812
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:43,160
Don't you have self respect?'

813
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:47,029
So I don't know what to tell her

814
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:52,434
So you are not able to sleep,
because you are up all night...

815
00:54:52,526 --> 00:54:58,272
wondering whether to tell
your best friend to shut up or not?

816
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:03,739
My grandfather used
to tell me a story...

817
00:55:04,438 --> 00:55:08,011
please narrate it to your best friend

818
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:12,150
My grandfather was a mountain-climber

819
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:17,253
Before any expedition,
he would be thoroughly prepared

820
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:21,598
<i>Sadly, poor Pyarelalji
was not like this</i>

821
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,534
<i>Who Pyarelalji?</i>

822
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:28,332
A very old friend of my grandfathers'

823
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:30,455
He was also a
mountain-climbing enthusiast...

824
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:34,502
whose life-long desire
was to climb the toughest peak...

825
00:55:34,768 --> 00:55:36,543
Mt. Everest!

826
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:40,745
<i>Finally one day, Pyarelalji
got the chance to climb Mt. Everest...</i>

827
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,454
with a Chinese trekking
expedition group

828
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:49,218
Without thought or preparation,
he said yes and left

829
00:55:49,316 --> 00:55:51,387
But the group was Chinese...

830
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:53,657
so they could speak only
in their own language...

831
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:55,564
no English Vinglish

832
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:59,163
So the trek began

833
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,537
As they slowly and
steadily climbed higher...

834
00:56:03,998 --> 00:56:10,973
<i>Pyarelalji paced ahead of
the group with much enthusiasm...</i>

835
00:56:11,405 --> 00:56:14,117
while the Chinese people kept waving
from behind and shouting in Chinese...

836
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:17,554
<i>'Don't go ahead! hatahau hatahau!'</i>

837
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:21,582
<i>but Pyarelalji thought
they were cheering him</i> oh...

838
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:25,289
and saying 'go ahead,

839
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:27,098
You can speak Chinese?

840
00:56:27,454 --> 00:56:28,296
Can you?

841
00:56:28,355 --> 00:56:29,060
<i>No</i>

842
00:56:29,123 --> 00:56:30,329
Then this works

843
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,562
Don't laugh, listen

844
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:37,004
<i>Suddenly, Pyarelalji saw</i> a <i>growling
snow leopard in front of him...</i>

845
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:41,012
<i>Pyarelal got scre***
I mean he got bloody scared</i>

846
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:43,413
Now he started waving his hands
frantically and shouting 'Help, Help!'

847
00:56:43,437 --> 00:56:48,147
But the Chinese people
thought he is just happy

848
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:53,120
So he kept crying for help,
and they kept waving back

849
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:55,353
Then?

850
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:59,189
<i>Then the snow leopard
ate up poor Pyarelalji</i>

851
00:56:59,353 --> 00:56:59,694
What?

852
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:00,527
Yes he was hungry

853
00:57:00,654 --> 00:57:02,656
You don't find many
people on Mt. Everest...

854
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,196
And the group kept shouting...

855
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:06,202
'don't go ahead'

856
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:09,572
What a strange story

857
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,634
No, it's not a strange story

858
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,239
Please tell your friend...

859
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:19,478
that sometimes we choose
the tough path only because...

860
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,550
we feel that to achieve
important things...

861
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:25,021
we have to take the tough path

862
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:30,059
We feel we need to punish ourselves...

863
00:57:31,352 --> 00:57:32,990
but why?

864
00:57:34,521 --> 00:57:36,364
Why not choose the easy way out?

865
00:57:36,457 --> 00:57:38,266
What is so bad about it?

866
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:44,371
Especially when we are
unprepared for the tough path

867
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:49,578
Why climb mountains
when you are not ready to?

868
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:51,175
Excuse me

869
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,385
You will tell your
friend the story right?

870
00:57:57,177 --> 00:57:59,453
It's important

871
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:12,035
Okay, I think...

872
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,698
My sleeping problem began...

873
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:18,637
when Raghuvendra got engaged

874
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:20,606
Raghuvendra?

875
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:21,978
The guy in my story?

876
00:58:22,036 --> 00:58:24,642
Right, your friend's...

877
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:28,048
No, mine

878
00:58:29,076 --> 00:58:32,387
At least I thought he was mine

879
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:40,629
We used to work together

880
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:45,563
Jack!

881
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,076
What are you doing here?

882
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,270
What are you doing here?

883
00:58:56,604 --> 00:59:00,313
You don't answer my calls,
you moved here without telling me

884
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:01,478
Without telling you

885
00:59:02,142 --> 00:59:03,246
Why would I tell you?

886
00:59:04,111 --> 00:59:05,215
Who are you?

887
00:59:06,313 --> 00:59:08,259
Actually I have one
thing to tell you...

888
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:10,651
I've made my decision

889
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:14,390
What decision?

890
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:16,263
Kaira, I have to talk to you...

891
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:18,358
Just shut up, one second

892
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,603
Listen to this story

893
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,474
This man wants to climb Mt. Everest...

894
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,671
but without any preparation
he leaves for Mt. Everest...

895
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:29,479
with Chinese companions...

896
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:31,377
and as he's about to fall...

897
00:59:31,438 --> 00:59:34,146
the Chinese people don't understand...

898
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,418
obviously, because they are Chinese...

899
00:59:35,442 --> 00:59:36,978
and they keep waving their flag...

900
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:38,077
and the man is stuck...

901
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,715
and then a tiger eats him up!

902
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,352
Got it?

903
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:51,536
The difficult option
is not the only option

904
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:55,472
We can choose the easy option
also because the easy option is easy

905
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,707
You know, forget it

906
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:03,544
It's too much for your small mind

907
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:05,413
It's a very deep thought

908
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:09,277
Are you talking about
working on the film?

909
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,317
I was talking about
NOT working on the film!

910
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:13,789
That's my decision

911
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:16,424
Okay, okay good

912
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,756
Good?

913
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:20,189
Yes I think that's the best...

914
01:00:20,254 --> 01:00:21,528
You think?

915
01:00:22,256 --> 01:00:23,326
Did you hear that?

916
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,528
You think?

917
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:30,404
I have already taken the
decision to not work on your film...

918
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,535
What do you mean by 'you think'?

919
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:38,478
I guess someone really
does need therapy...

920
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,610
You told him?

921
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:41,516
No Koko

922
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:42,417
Him?

923
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:44,581
Yes, she told me, so?

924
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:47,687
And anyway why do you need therapy?

925
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:51,353
What's the big tragedy in your life?

926
01:00:51,685 --> 01:00:54,291
You didn't want to get serious,
didn't want to commit

927
01:00:54,354 --> 01:00:57,130
So I don't understand,
what is the problem?

928
01:00:57,258 --> 01:00:58,566
You don't understand?
- No!

929
01:00:58,625 --> 01:00:59,695
Then get out

930
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:02,540
Oh God Kaira...

931
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,567
You really need to grow up

932
01:01:09,236 --> 01:01:15,482
Good thing you've decided
not to work on my film...

933
01:01:16,076 --> 01:01:19,353
I'm looking for mature
people to work with

934
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:21,551
What did I just say?

935
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:25,493
Get out right? Get out!

936
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:31,365
Bye, see you Jackie

937
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:33,701
I'm not mature enough to
handle your big fat project...

938
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:36,173
but mature enough to sleep with you?

939
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,267
Amazing! What a revelation

940
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:39,606
Kaira I came here to...

941
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:42,308
I don't want to do this, get out

942
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,144
What are you doing Kaira?

943
01:01:44,438 --> 01:01:45,473
Just get out!

944
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:56,754
Koko, are you sure about this?

945
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:00,094
I know with all these
personal issues...

946
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:02,532
working with Raghu will be tough...

947
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,500
but this was your big break

948
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:08,333
Okay Jack

949
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:14,043
Sometimes we choose
a tough path just because...

950
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:16,707
we believe that to
achieve important things...

951
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:20,075
we have to choose the tough option

952
01:02:20,507 --> 01:02:25,684
But sometimes you need
to choose the easier option...

953
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:31,787
because at that time that
is the best option for you

954
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:34,187
Right?

955
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:39,628
Especially when you are
not ready to face that tough path

956
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,699
Damn! Wish I had said
it right when he was here

957
01:02:53,407 --> 01:02:55,182
You want some tea?

958
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,435
Tonight I'm going to sleep so well,
so <i>well...</i>

959
01:03:14,995 --> 01:03:16,235
Very well!

960
01:04:40,414 --> 01:04:43,361
I was at this construction site...

961
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:45,795
with all these construction workers...

962
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:49,057
all short and strange people

963
01:04:49,456 --> 01:04:52,528
Suddenly, I lose my balance...

964
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:55,699
and I go falling down...

965
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:58,266
this big fall...

966
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,740
and land in muck

967
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:03,978
I think it was a gutter

968
01:05:05,706 --> 01:05:11,019
All these workers are just staring,
but no one is helping...

969
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:13,287
I look up...

970
01:05:13,714 --> 01:05:16,490
and I see my camera dangling...

971
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:20,494
and then suddenly out of nowhere...

972
01:05:20,654 --> 01:05:23,692
this group of newly married women...

973
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:29,332
<i>in saris, pal/us & bindis
all land up there...</i>

974
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:35,203
and they start pointing
at me, laughing at me

975
01:05:37,738 --> 01:05:40,742
Bam! I woke up

976
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:42,352
It was 4 am...

977
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,219
I went straight to the bathroom
and stood under the shower

978
01:05:45,412 --> 01:05:46,789
Why shower?

979
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:49,417
I don't know

980
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:55,725
I felt dirty, I felt
like I needed to clean up

981
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,636
So this Raghuvendra,
he is tall and handsome?

982
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:02,238
That's your conclusion of my dream?

983
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:03,969
Just asking

984
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:09,706
You know what I felt...

985
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:17,719
I felt I am ugly, trashy, cheap, dirty

986
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:18,978
That's funny

987
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:20,218
What's funny?

988
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:22,320
I mean...

989
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:29,360
all this from a girl who is
the opposite of ugly, trashy or dirty

990
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:34,161
That's funny... not "ha-ha" funny

991
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:36,472
Okay

992
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:39,369
Oops!

993
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:41,178
What's With this?

994
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:47,417
It only creaks when you really like
someone, but can't do anything about it

995
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:57,359
Yes, Raghuvendra is tall and handsome

996
01:06:57,518 --> 01:07:03,332
So you like tall people,
not short and strange

997
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:06,971
Maybe... Sid was also tall

998
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,529
So there's a Sid too?

999
01:07:08,596 --> 01:07:10,166
Yes so?

1000
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:14,412
So I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1001
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:15,501
you will have admirers

1002
01:07:15,736 --> 01:07:16,737
What do you mean?

1003
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:18,345
What do you mean by admirers?

1004
01:07:18,505 --> 01:07:20,542
I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1005
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:21,518
you will have admirers

1006
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:22,575
Admirers?
- Yes

1007
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:24,154
You're trying to say
that there are lots of men!

1008
01:07:24,178 --> 01:07:25,355
That's what you're trying to say

1009
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,120
No, what do you want me to say?

1010
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:28,384
Why would I say that? No

1011
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:29,519
That's what you are saying

1012
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:34,191
You actually mean that I'm a fast
girl, a cheap girl... - No come on!

1013
01:07:34,255 --> 01:07:35,563
Fast dirty cheap...

1014
01:07:35,622 --> 01:07:38,466
why use these words?

1015
01:07:38,525 --> 01:07:40,232
Isn't that what the world thinks?

1016
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:44,672
If a girl has more than
one relationship then that's it!

1017
01:08:10,657 --> 01:08:12,227
Kaira...

1018
01:08:12,993 --> 01:08:15,166
have you ever bought a chair?

1019
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:16,132
What?

1020
01:08:16,196 --> 01:08:18,506
<i>A chair, kursi
have you ever bought one?</i>

1021
01:08:19,066 --> 01:08:20,170
Yes

1022
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,112
And did you just go into a
shop and buy the first chair you saw?

1023
01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:26,340
<i>No</i>

1024
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:27,714
Exactly my point

1025
01:08:27,975 --> 01:08:32,185
We look at so many different
chairs until we find the right one

1026
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,461
Some chairs may be comfortable
but look like shit...

1027
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:39,064
others look nice but
are hard on the butt...

1028
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:44,125
So the process starts,
chair after chair...

1029
01:08:44,191 --> 01:08:46,671
how many chairs we
check out before we find...

1030
01:08:46,727 --> 01:08:49,731
that one chair!

1031
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:55,706
It doesn't creak with me

1032
01:08:57,671 --> 01:09:02,677
If we look for so many
options just to buy a chair...

1033
01:09:02,943 --> 01:09:05,150
then shouldn't we look at options...

1034
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:07,492
when choosing a life partner?

1035
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:11,257
So... dirty cheap fast... no

1036
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:16,393
Smart clear fine... actually superfine!

1037
01:09:17,191 --> 01:09:19,137
Wait wait wait

1038
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:23,205
So the women in my
dream who believe that...

1039
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:27,268
marriage is the only
acceptable relationship...

1040
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:30,382
I felt dirty because of them

1041
01:09:30,437 --> 01:09:35,318
See? You figured it out yourself...
you don't need anyone's help

1042
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:40,117
But the dangling camera?
What does that mean?

1043
01:09:40,514 --> 01:09:44,291
Just like my future,
it's hanging in the air

1044
01:09:44,752 --> 01:09:47,460
Maybe you should sit on my chair...

1045
01:09:47,521 --> 01:09:51,128
and I should sit here from today

1046
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,297
It's so cool

1047
01:09:54,461 --> 01:10:00,173
I wish the whole world could
hear about your chair theory

1048
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:05,780
Why is it important for
the whole world to hear this?

1049
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,685
No I just...

1050
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:12,613
if they understand this chair theory
they will stop judging others...

1051
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,126
and what a beautiful world it will be

1052
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:16,350
No Kaira...

1053
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:20,060
when you understand yourself <i>well...</i>

1054
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:23,427
then what others think
of you doesn't matter

1055
01:10:26,193 --> 01:10:33,133
If you don't take charge
of your own life somebody else will

1056
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:39,751
I pity those who don't shop for chairs

1057
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:46,252
Kaira, will you go
back to your chair please?

1058
01:10:47,248 --> 01:10:49,694
Looked like you wanted
to take my chair home with you

1059
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:54,699
And speaking of home,
I have homework for you

1060
01:10:55,055 --> 01:10:55,465
Homework?

1061
01:10:55,522 --> 01:10:57,695
Yes I'm very strict
with my homework assignments

1062
01:10:57,758 --> 01:10:58,532
Okay

1063
01:10:58,659 --> 01:11:01,071
I want you to chat
with your mom and dad

1064
01:11:01,462 --> 01:11:03,339
10 minutes with each please

1065
01:11:03,397 --> 01:11:05,206
Please, what will I say to them?

1066
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:06,605
Time's up, see you next week

1067
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:09,238
What! We have 20 seconds more

1068
01:11:10,538 --> 01:11:14,611
Hey you saw that?

1069
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:17,348
What happened?

1070
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:18,683
20 seconds happened

1071
01:11:21,415 --> 01:11:24,021
I don't like this buzzer

1072
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:26,131
Homework Kaira

1073
01:11:28,322 --> 01:11:31,769
Hey, those are really
nice looking glasses...

1074
01:11:32,259 --> 01:11:33,260
Thanks

1075
01:11:33,727 --> 01:11:36,674
You're going to see Jug?

1076
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:39,301
Yup, I have an appointment

1077
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:40,740
Really?

1078
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:42,343
You have problems too?

1079
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:43,471
YUP

1080
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:46,578
I am going to get my cycle repaired

1081
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,622
Repairs cycles too?

1082
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:53,589
Hi dad

1083
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,627
Hi darling, when will you come home?

1084
01:11:55,683 --> 01:11:56,593
I'll come

1085
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,494
You will be home before
Kiddo arrives right?

1086
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:02,358
There's enough time for that,
of course I'll be there

1087
01:12:02,423 --> 01:12:04,334
Your mom is in high spirits...

1088
01:12:04,391 --> 01:12:06,337
full planning for the party

1089
01:12:06,393 --> 01:12:09,602
Obviously, her prince is arriving

1090
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:14,112
Those restaurant guys
loved your film...

1091
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:16,205
They said it was very well shot

1092
01:12:16,403 --> 01:12:17,711
Oh the hotel video

1093
01:12:18,105 --> 01:12:19,675
<i>Close up of Prawn Balchao?</i>

1094
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:22,576
Anyway I'll call later

1095
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:23,747
Okay

1096
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:25,249
Bye

1097
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:29,419
4 minutes!

1098
01:12:33,554 --> 01:12:34,692
Yes Koko, you called?

1099
01:12:34,755 --> 01:12:37,235
Yes, why didn't you pick up
- I was cleaning Kiddo's room...

1100
01:12:39,326 --> 01:12:40,771
I didn't have my phone

1101
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:43,338
Okay but I'm busy now,
can't talk bye

1102
01:12:43,497 --> 01:12:44,601
Okay

1103
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:47,069
Shift that!

1104
01:12:48,235 --> 01:12:51,182
'Talk to mom and dad
for 10 minutes'...is he mad!

1105
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,320
Beach?

1106
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:17,739
Are we having the session out here?

1107
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:20,145
Why not? Problem?

1108
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:23,311
No, but is it allowed?

1109
01:13:24,472 --> 01:13:26,281
Whose permission do I need?

1110
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,553
I don't know,
but aren't there some rules?

1111
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:33,385
Like privacy,
closed door, couch and all that?

1112
01:13:33,647 --> 01:13:34,785
There are rules

1113
01:13:35,115 --> 01:13:39,621
But one should know which
ones to break and which ones to not

1114
01:13:40,788 --> 01:13:44,201
Now people will know I am crazy

1115
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:48,502
Who are these people
who keep following you?

1116
01:13:54,668 --> 01:14:00,482
Despite the mess, Goa is
the most beautiful place in India

1117
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:03,447
I wish I could agree

1118
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:06,114
Why? You don't like Goa?

1119
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:09,050
I was born here

1120
01:14:09,216 --> 01:14:14,063
This is where my parents live,
how can I like it?

1121
01:14:16,056 --> 01:14:18,002
Did your homework?

1122
01:14:18,526 --> 01:14:19,698
Only half...

1123
01:14:20,294 --> 01:14:22,240
I managed to talk
to dad for 5 minutes...

1124
01:14:22,663 --> 01:14:26,167
okay 4 minutes,
but that's a record in itself

1125
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:28,611
And your mom?

1126
01:14:29,403 --> 01:14:31,679
I tried, but she was busy

1127
01:14:32,706 --> 01:14:34,617
So you've only done a quarter

1128
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:37,416
What did you chat with your dad?

1129
01:14:37,678 --> 01:14:39,715
About Kiddo, my brother...

1130
01:14:41,282 --> 01:14:43,421
he's studying at
the London University...

1131
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:47,727
he's coming home soon, so
my parents are hosting a big party...

1132
01:14:47,788 --> 01:14:49,324
for his homecoming

1133
01:14:49,757 --> 01:14:53,603
When I got here nobody
even said 'welcome'

1134
01:14:54,762 --> 01:14:56,400
So you don't like Kiddo?

1135
01:14:56,463 --> 01:15:01,037
No no I love Kiddo, I really do

1136
01:15:01,402 --> 01:15:04,508
He's the only one
who can make me smile...

1137
01:15:04,638 --> 01:15:06,379
just by being there

1138
01:15:10,477 --> 01:15:14,653
When he was little,
I would read him his favorite comic...

1139
01:15:15,082 --> 01:15:17,688
<i>you know Tinkle, have you read it?</i>

1140
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:18,620
Yes

1141
01:15:18,686 --> 01:15:24,193
<i>Hunter Shambhu,
Kaafia the Crow & Supands'...</i>

1142
01:15:24,492 --> 01:15:27,268
<i>So Supandi! was Kiddo's favourite...</i>

1143
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:31,466
So <i>I would rep/ace Supand's
with Kiddo's name...</i>

1144
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:33,136
and read it to him

1145
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:37,116
He loved hearing the story in my voice

1146
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:40,742
Even today, he says it's
his best childhood memory

1147
01:15:42,142 --> 01:15:44,452
And your best childhood memory?

1148
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:51,358
Come on, there must be something...

1149
01:15:53,521 --> 01:15:55,523
I don't know

1150
01:15:57,358 --> 01:16:00,498
What are your favourite childhood
memories?

1151
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:07,444
My dad used to bring
me here every Sunday...

1152
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:12,308
<i>To play Kabaddi with the sea</i>

1153
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,710
<i>Kabaddi with the sea?</i>

1154
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:26,090
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi</i>

1155
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,525
Go back!

1156
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:54,051
Just two more

1157
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:55,114
Okay

1158
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:09,169
I can do this all day long

1159
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:15,679
It's important that parents create
happy memories for their children

1160
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:19,011
Now I am a parent myself

1161
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:23,716
So I'm hoping...

1162
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:28,052
my son has at least
some happy memories...

1163
01:17:29,984 --> 01:17:32,487
to tell his therapist

1164
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:39,664
He stays with his mom

1165
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:44,134
In divorce cases kids
usually end up with the mother

1166
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:55,048
I just regret not being
able to spend enough time with him

1167
01:18:04,284 --> 01:18:06,992
I remember Shaira...

1168
01:18:08,956 --> 01:18:10,560
my doll

1169
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:16,203
My dad's birthday gift to me

1170
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:22,006
When I used to live with my
grandparents, Shaira was with me

1171
01:18:23,204 --> 01:18:29,120
I never played with her,
just kept her close to me

1172
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:35,759
At night,
I would hug her tightly and sleep

1173
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:50,602
You were shy?

1174
01:18:51,599 --> 01:18:52,737
Yes

1175
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:55,003
l-low did you know'?

1176
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:00,618
Shaira-Shy... I'm a genius, really

1177
01:19:00,674 --> 01:19:03,018
When I was little I was shy...

1178
01:19:03,077 --> 01:19:05,956
dad used to call me Kaira-Shaira

1179
01:19:06,046 --> 01:19:07,525
But now I'm fully Kaira

1180
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:09,561
Kaira-Shaira, now fully Kaira

1181
01:19:09,616 --> 01:19:10,616
Yes

1182
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:15,624
Are you sure?

1183
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:21,367
Come on

1184
01:19:23,964 --> 01:19:27,537
Listen tell me...

1185
01:19:27,601 --> 01:19:30,639
why did you want me to talk
to Mom and Dad for 10 minutes?

1186
01:19:30,704 --> 01:19:34,345
Is there some Chinese
mountain story behind this?

1187
01:19:34,975 --> 01:19:37,285
Someday you'll have
to climb Mt. Everest right?

1188
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:09,452
Where is Shaira?

1189
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,353
Who Shaira?

1190
01:20:11,512 --> 01:20:12,684
My doll!

1191
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:14,453
The one dad gave me

1192
01:20:14,515 --> 01:20:16,791
l-low come you thought
of that doll all of a sudden'?

1193
01:20:17,051 --> 01:20:18,228
Do you know where she is or not?

1194
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:19,452
She may be in the storeroom...

1195
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:22,194
along with your and Kiddo's old things

1196
01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:24,202
What do you mean by maybe?

1197
01:20:24,258 --> 01:20:26,204
She must be there somewhere

1198
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:29,173
l-low will I remember
after all these years'?

1199
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:34,145
Do you remember anything
at all about those years?

1200
01:20:37,604 --> 01:20:38,742
<i>Taste this Bibik</i>

1201
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:40,379
<i>What is Bibik now?</i>

1202
01:20:40,474 --> 01:20:43,114
<i>Bebinca! Kiddo's favourite</i>

1203
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:44,485
No I'm leaving

1204
01:20:44,545 --> 01:20:47,082
<i>Pm making coconut laddoos for you...</i>

1205
01:20:47,148 --> 01:20:48,149
your favourite...

1206
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:49,655
see I remembered

1207
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,787
You just want to make me fat!

1208
01:20:57,057 --> 01:20:58,627
Coconut laddoos!

1209
01:20:59,326 --> 01:21:03,297
I feel like breaking
a coconut on someone's head

1210
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:08,408
No, no violence, do deep breathing

1211
01:21:08,536 --> 01:21:11,540
What memories will
parents leave behind?

1212
01:21:11,672 --> 01:21:13,383
When they can't remember
anything themselves?

1213
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:17,253
Let's drink to Shaira, wherever she is

1214
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:38,201
<i>In my street</i>

1215
01:21:38,265 --> 01:21:40,643
<i>The moon that appears</i>

1216
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:43,147
<i>That brings Eid with it</i>

1217
01:21:43,203 --> 01:21:46,082
<i>is that you?</i>

1218
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:48,482
<i>My</i> mom

1219
01:21:48,576 --> 01:21:51,113
<i>Has made me a suit</i>

1220
01:21:51,178 --> 01:21:53,317
<i>Has shown me a dream</i>

1221
01:21:53,381 --> 01:21:55,361
<i>is it of you?</i>

1222
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:58,420
<i>My heart is destroying
itself for someone</i>

1223
01:21:58,486 --> 01:22:00,227
<i>Who is it?</i>

1224
01:22:00,287 --> 01:22:02,096
<i>Its you</i>

1225
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,540
<i>My heart is protecting
itself for someone</i>

1226
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:10,302
<i>Who is it?</i>

1227
01:22:10,364 --> 01:22:12,366
<i>Its you</i>

1228
01:22:15,636 --> 01:22:20,642
<i>Who is that so far</i> away

1229
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:25,748
Who is that so close

1230
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:30,689
<i>Who is that so specie!</i>

1231
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:32,753
<i>Its you</i>

1232
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:54,809
<i>The one for whom</i>

1233
01:22:55,076 --> 01:22:59,718
<i>I'd break all other hearts</i>

1234
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:02,386
<i>is it you?</i>

1235
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:05,157
<i>The one for whom</i>

1236
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:07,631
<i>Pd go on living</i>

1237
01:23:07,688 --> 01:23:10,032
<i>Pd insure my loving</i>

1238
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:12,195
<i>is it you?</i>

1239
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:13,704
The one who's presence

1240
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,069
<i>Makes all come alive</i>

1241
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:16,665
<i>Who is it?</i>

1242
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,676
<i>Its you</i>

1243
01:23:22,303 --> 01:23:27,184
<i>Who is that so far</i> away

1244
01:23:27,241 --> 01:23:32,213
Who is that so close

1245
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:37,160
<i>Who is that so specie!</i>

1246
01:23:37,284 --> 01:23:38,786
<i>Its you</i>

1247
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:47,261
<i>Who is in my verses?</i>

1248
01:23:48,095 --> 01:23:52,566
<i>Who is in my poetry?</i>

1249
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:57,173
<i>Who is in my diary?</i>

1250
01:23:57,738 --> 01:24:00,651
<i>Its you</i>

1251
01:24:10,051 --> 01:24:11,051
Hi!

1252
01:24:12,253 --> 01:24:13,493
Oh hello...

1253
01:24:14,088 --> 01:24:15,499
That was a beautiful song

1254
01:24:15,589 --> 01:24:18,297
You have a beautiful voice

1255
01:24:18,726 --> 01:24:20,364
You totally rocked it

1256
01:24:20,661 --> 01:24:25,337
If your audience is so rocking,
the song has to match up

1257
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:29,204
I'm Jackie, this is Kaira

1258
01:24:32,773 --> 01:24:33,773
And you are?

1259
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:36,213
Rumi

1260
01:24:36,343 --> 01:24:37,583
Rumi?

1261
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:40,357
Girls night out?

1262
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:41,414
Yes

1263
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:43,292
They are the best nights

1264
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,796
Hey, great song bro...

1265
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:49,097
you killed it!

1266
01:24:49,156 --> 01:24:49,657
Did I?

1267
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:53,260
Killed who? We're all alive here

1268
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:56,597
Girls night, don't mind, cheers

1269
01:24:57,097 --> 01:25:00,237
What a voice you have,
you should be singing in films

1270
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:05,410
Why only films?
There are all kinds of music...

1271
01:25:06,073 --> 01:25:10,715
there is rock, pop, jazz, blues...

1272
01:25:12,012 --> 01:25:14,492
do you like blues?

1273
01:25:15,082 --> 01:25:16,755
Blues?

1274
01:25:17,551 --> 01:25:19,690
You seem more red to me...

1275
01:25:22,356 --> 01:25:23,733
What?

1276
01:25:27,594 --> 01:25:29,733
<i>Vorresti fuggire con me?</i>

1277
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:31,508
That was Greek to me...

1278
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:33,077
It's Italian actually

1279
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:37,013
Does that mean that I'm
so deadly and gorgeous...

1280
01:25:37,138 --> 01:25:38,248
that you can't take your eyes off me?

1281
01:25:38,272 --> 01:25:39,717
Not at all

1282
01:25:41,108 --> 01:25:44,487
It means that I'm heading to a private
beach with some of my friends...

1283
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:46,149
to play some music

1284
01:25:47,114 --> 01:25:49,720
Would you like to run away with me?

1285
01:26:03,697 --> 01:26:05,142
Not bad

1286
01:27:02,123 --> 01:27:03,966
Somebody seems to be
in a musical mood today

1287
01:27:07,361 --> 01:27:12,140
<i>"My heart is destroying itself
for someone, who is it? It's you"</i>

1288
01:27:13,133 --> 01:27:14,339
Excuse me?

1289
01:27:17,004 --> 01:27:23,114
<i>"Last night! went
out to listen to</i> a <i>band"</i>

1290
01:27:24,311 --> 01:27:29,420
<i>“Which band was it,
where did you go where did you go?”</i>

1291
01:27:30,217 --> 01:27:35,064
<i>"The name of the band I don't know
I don't know... but singer! know"</i>

1292
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:39,763
So <i>tell</i> me more...
<i>tell</i> me more... tell me more

1293
01:27:41,128 --> 01:27:44,302
We didn't talk, only music

1294
01:27:44,565 --> 01:27:46,169
What to tell?

1295
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:49,003
So what was his name? Banjo?

1296
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:53,017
Or the fellow was called Cello?

1297
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:54,683
Rumi
- Wow!

1298
01:27:54,775 --> 01:27:57,312
<i>My new kursi, my new chair</i>

1299
01:27:59,246 --> 01:28:00,246
So, comfortable?

1300
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,280
What?

1301
01:28:01,348 --> 01:28:03,350
New chair, comfortable?

1302
01:28:04,318 --> 01:28:07,697
Yes but it's a musical chair...

1303
01:28:07,955 --> 01:28:09,957
twenty four hours will
have to listen to music...

1304
01:28:10,024 --> 01:28:11,025
how to listen?

1305
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:15,029
Why don't you tell him straight,
that you like dialogue too

1306
01:28:15,129 --> 01:28:18,474
l-low can you tell a musician
to stop the music and talk'?

1307
01:28:18,599 --> 01:28:21,239
He'll think I'm a musical idiot...

1308
01:28:21,335 --> 01:28:23,337
have you ever felt like an idiot?

1309
01:28:25,573 --> 01:28:27,644
I've sat through a
three hour Italian Opera...

1310
01:28:28,309 --> 01:28:30,220
pretended it touched my heart...

1311
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:33,586
when every minute was torture

1312
01:28:34,615 --> 01:28:37,335
I wanted to stand up on the chair
and scream even louder than them...

1313
01:28:37,551 --> 01:28:39,258
<i>Pm an opera idiot!</i>

1314
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:46,098
Wow, okay

1315
01:28:46,327 --> 01:28:49,331
What would you do if you
were dating an opera singer?

1316
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:51,470
I would say, 'Darling,
I will do anything for you...

1317
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:53,611
but don't make me hear the opera'

1318
01:28:54,134 --> 01:28:56,375
Then end of story right?
She would dump you and run

1319
01:28:56,437 --> 01:28:59,577
Or after 6 months of suffering,
I would run away

1320
01:29:00,207 --> 01:29:04,417
If one is going to suffer,
the other person should at least know

1321
01:29:04,545 --> 01:29:07,458
What is the point
of suffering in silence?

1322
01:29:10,217 --> 01:29:11,252
See when...

1323
01:29:13,387 --> 01:29:15,731
I'm so sorry - It's okay

1324
01:29:16,057 --> 01:29:17,229
I will get a new one for you

1325
01:29:17,391 --> 01:29:19,064
I'll do it, don't touch it...

1326
01:29:20,461 --> 01:29:23,305
I think it's safer to have
our sessions outdoor

1327
01:29:24,565 --> 01:29:26,977
Go on, Rumi

1328
01:29:52,326 --> 01:29:55,330
I like people who smell nice

1329
01:29:56,697 --> 01:29:59,007
I hate smelly people

1330
01:29:59,099 --> 01:30:00,476
Really? Why'?

1331
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:03,374
So you like smelly people?

1332
01:30:03,504 --> 01:30:06,508
Everyone has a different smell...

1333
01:30:06,774 --> 01:30:10,654
that's how people get
attracted to each other

1334
01:30:12,413 --> 01:30:16,054
Eeks! Who goes around smelling
people to get attracted?

1335
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:17,623
Dogs

1336
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:21,198
Dogs

1337
01:30:22,423 --> 01:30:24,403
Ya dogs!

1338
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:28,239
Ganju, we should record
our conversations...

1339
01:30:28,562 --> 01:30:31,304
they're true genius sometimes

1340
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:31,775
Genius!

1341
01:30:32,032 --> 01:30:33,067
Yes please

1342
01:30:33,467 --> 01:30:40,612
"Genius is not one
who has all the answers...

1343
01:30:41,575 --> 01:30:48,288
genius is one who has the
patience to find every answer"

1344
01:30:50,451 --> 01:30:51,122
Deep

1345
01:30:51,252 --> 01:30:52,788
Which genius said this?

1346
01:30:53,454 --> 01:30:55,491
Dr. Jehangir Khan

1347
01:30:55,723 --> 01:30:57,396
Khan... khh

1348
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:59,495
So does he smell nice?

1349
01:30:59,627 --> 01:31:00,833
Who?

1350
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:06,199
There you go

1351
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:10,607
Wait let it breathe... cheers

1352
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:19,389
Listen to this bit

1353
01:31:20,614 --> 01:31:21,649
I love chocolate

1354
01:31:21,782 --> 01:31:23,352
Okay this bit

1355
01:31:32,426 --> 01:31:33,632
Wait one second

1356
01:31:35,562 --> 01:31:38,270
Pink Floyd's first album,
you have to get this

1357
01:31:41,435 --> 01:31:47,477
<i>"I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all"</i>

1358
01:31:49,176 --> 01:31:52,214
<i>“§ agree,
you find a place in every heart”</i>

1359
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:53,656
You like strawberries?

1360
01:31:56,483 --> 01:32:04,163
<i>“Yes you are a dream
your every move is a charm...”</i>

1361
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:09,639
"but, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise"

1362
01:32:22,443 --> 01:32:22,784
Try some?

1363
01:32:23,043 --> 01:32:25,489
Can we just have the music off please!

1364
01:32:28,616 --> 01:32:32,792
I'm sorry, I just need some silence

1365
01:32:41,095 --> 01:32:42,438
Everything okay'?

1366
01:32:43,063 --> 01:32:46,169
I wrote this song for you

1367
01:32:46,734 --> 01:32:48,805
But it's okay,
silence is good sometimes...

1368
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:51,345
there is beauty in silence too...

1369
01:32:51,672 --> 01:32:53,583
let's be silent

1370
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:17,031
That's not silent

1371
01:33:17,565 --> 01:33:19,101
I'm sorry

1372
01:33:25,005 --> 01:33:26,484
Okay play your song

1373
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:28,451
No forget my song...

1374
01:33:29,076 --> 01:33:30,350
let's talk about you

1375
01:33:30,511 --> 01:33:32,388
I want to know everything about you

1376
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:35,761
Come, sit

1377
01:33:37,051 --> 01:33:38,291
Tell me about you

1378
01:33:38,352 --> 01:33:41,299
What was your first film about?

1379
01:33:41,655 --> 01:33:45,296
When did you decide
to be a camerawoman?

1380
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:46,429
What's your journey?

1381
01:33:47,328 --> 01:33:51,674
You know, I haven't even
shot a selfie in my life

1382
01:33:52,499 --> 01:33:53,603
Isn't that funny?

1383
01:33:54,068 --> 01:33:54,512
So tell me...

1384
01:33:54,568 --> 01:33:59,108
I want to know about your dreams,
your inspirations, your aspirations...

1385
01:33:59,173 --> 01:34:01,050
I want to know everything about you

1386
01:34:04,378 --> 01:34:05,379
Huh?

1387
01:34:23,063 --> 01:34:24,201
What's going on?

1388
01:34:26,567 --> 01:34:27,607
Shall I put on some music?

1389
01:34:28,069 --> 01:34:29,207
Please

1390
01:34:29,637 --> 01:34:31,617
I've heard enough for a lifetime

1391
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:36,618
So still suffering silently?
Or did you say it?

1392
01:34:37,144 --> 01:34:38,555
I yelled it

1393
01:34:38,612 --> 01:34:39,682
So he ran away?

1394
01:34:39,747 --> 01:34:43,160
No, he was very sweet actually

1395
01:34:46,053 --> 01:34:52,060
He stopped playing the song,
which he had composed for me...

1396
01:34:52,259 --> 01:34:55,433
and began asking about me

1397
01:34:57,531 --> 01:35:00,307
I felt guilty at first but...

1398
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:11,387
Why are romantic
relationships so irritating?

1399
01:35:13,013 --> 01:35:17,120
With friends,
it's all so easy, it just flows...

1400
01:35:17,484 --> 01:35:20,624
you don't need to make such an effort

1401
01:35:21,622 --> 01:35:24,660
Who are the 5 people closest to you?

1402
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:26,195
Your top 5?

1403
01:35:26,994 --> 01:35:28,029
Why?

1404
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:30,763
There is an important study...

1405
01:35:31,098 --> 01:35:32,634
based on the size
of the human brain...

1406
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:37,171
that shows that everyone has about
150 people in their whole universe

1407
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:40,715
The next cut is the 50 who
you would invite home for dinner...

1408
01:35:40,774 --> 01:35:45,245
then 15 who you turn to
in times of need for comfort...

1409
01:35:45,312 --> 01:35:50,386
and the final cut is of 5
people who are your whole world...

1410
01:35:50,517 --> 01:35:53,123
your inner circle

1411
01:35:56,223 --> 01:35:57,759
Who are your 5?

1412
01:36:01,695 --> 01:36:06,201
Fatty, Kiddo, Jackie, Alka...

1413
01:36:08,536 --> 01:36:10,015
Raghuvendra, no

1414
01:36:10,204 --> 01:36:12,115
And I forgot to add...

1415
01:36:12,707 --> 01:36:16,519
these 5 people can
also change with time

1416
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:20,581
That's true but these 4
people will always be on the list

1417
01:36:20,648 --> 01:36:24,425
Okay, so think of these 4 and tell me

1418
01:36:24,485 --> 01:36:27,227
l-low do you feel when
you are with them...

1419
01:36:27,588 --> 01:36:30,762
as compared to the changing 5th?

1420
01:36:31,025 --> 01:36:35,997
L-low, how do these
4 people make you feel'?

1421
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:42,012
Special, I feel special I feel...

1422
01:36:42,202 --> 01:36:46,082
important, I feel respected...

1423
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:49,349
I feel happy and safe

1424
01:36:49,543 --> 01:36:53,457
So you don't feel safe
with your boyfriends?

1425
01:36:54,215 --> 01:36:56,024
No...

1426
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:59,056
I feel safe but...

1427
01:37:01,021 --> 01:37:04,662
I don't know it's not that

1428
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,333
With my friends...

1429
01:37:10,531 --> 01:37:14,308
I feel free, I feel like myself

1430
01:37:15,236 --> 01:37:16,738
Why safe?

1431
01:37:18,072 --> 01:37:21,610
When you start liking a guy...

1432
01:37:26,147 --> 01:37:28,058
What is your fear Kaira?

1433
01:37:36,157 --> 01:37:37,659
It's back in one piece

1434
01:37:40,227 --> 01:37:42,264
I believe broken things
can be put back together

1435
01:38:00,748 --> 01:38:03,194
l-low is the 'Brain Doctor' going'?

1436
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,457
Is he married or single?

1437
01:38:05,619 --> 01:38:06,620
Didi...

1438
01:38:06,687 --> 01:38:08,598
Hi Alka!

1439
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:10,390
Look there

1440
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:14,166
<i>Didi...
how are you?</i>

1441
01:38:14,228 --> 01:38:15,298
Rubbish

1442
01:38:16,697 --> 01:38:18,973
Why did you go to the doctor?
Are you okay?

1443
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,110
I went to a 'Brain Doctor'

1444
01:38:21,235 --> 01:38:22,680
What happened to your brain?

1445
01:38:24,038 --> 01:38:29,750
Nothing, if you have an
emotional problem in your life...

1446
01:38:30,011 --> 01:38:32,651
a 'Brain Doctor' can help you solve it

1447
01:38:33,047 --> 01:38:35,027
Do such doctors exist?

1448
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:39,094
Then everyone should go to them

1449
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,522
Yes everyone should

1450
01:38:49,163 --> 01:38:54,340
<i>I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all</i>

1451
01:38:56,704 --> 01:39:02,382
<i>I agree, you find
a place in every heart</i>

1452
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:10,559
<i>Yes, you're a dream,
your every move a charm</i>

1453
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:17,399
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise...

1454
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:23,665
Don't stop!

1455
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:26,143
Come on, play the music

1456
01:39:40,581 --> 01:39:43,687
<i>Heart... be silent</i>

1457
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:46,493
<i>Don? beat so loud</i>

1458
01:39:48,188 --> 01:39:54,366
<i>Let her not see you suffer</i>

1459
01:39:55,563 --> 01:40:02,139
<i>You will smile now at my state</i>

1460
01:40:02,202 --> 01:40:09,142
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise

1461
01:40:27,094 --> 01:40:30,632
<i>Should I whisper in your ears</i>

1462
01:40:30,698 --> 01:40:34,202
<i>Or scream from mountain tops</i>

1463
01:40:37,204 --> 01:40:39,514
It was good fun

1464
01:40:39,573 --> 01:40:42,577
<i>We danced to Honey Singh
songs all night</i>

1465
01:40:42,677 --> 01:40:43,815
What's happening?

1466
01:40:44,645 --> 01:40:45,680
Fatty!

1467
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,792
I called you, why didn't you answer?

1468
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,121
<i>Hi Koks</i>

1469
01:40:52,653 --> 01:40:54,724
Why are you both grinning like that?

1470
01:40:54,788 --> 01:40:58,326
Jackie is just telling
me about her new boyfriend

1471
01:40:58,492 --> 01:40:59,493
What?

1472
01:41:00,228 --> 01:41:01,070
Hello?

1473
01:41:01,128 --> 01:41:02,368
What new boyfriend?

1474
01:41:02,429 --> 01:41:03,499
L-low about telling <i>me...</i>

1475
01:41:03,564 --> 01:41:05,566
I'm right here, am I invisible?

1476
01:41:05,633 --> 01:41:06,668
You didn't even ask

1477
01:41:06,734 --> 01:41:08,145
Why do I have to ask?

1478
01:41:08,202 --> 01:41:09,146
Okay guys relax

1479
01:41:09,203 --> 01:41:10,113
l-low can you not tell me'?

1480
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:14,050
I know why, because it's
that weird guy at the bar right'?

1481
01:41:14,108 --> 01:41:15,781
See this is what you do

1482
01:41:16,043 --> 01:41:17,120
You're always judging my men

1483
01:41:17,144 --> 01:41:19,055
I'm not judging,
you called him weird yourself

1484
01:41:19,113 --> 01:41:23,061
That was then, now I like him

1485
01:41:23,117 --> 01:41:26,064
But you didn't tell
me that you like him

1486
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,259
Because you never asked,
you're not around

1487
01:41:28,322 --> 01:41:30,666
l-low am I supposed to
know if you don't tell me'?

1488
01:41:30,724 --> 01:41:34,262
You keep doing this
and blame me for everything

1489
01:41:34,328 --> 01:41:36,171
I am around!

1490
01:41:37,698 --> 01:41:39,371
Fatty where are you?

1491
01:41:41,168 --> 01:41:43,341
Great you also leave me

1492
01:41:51,145 --> 01:41:53,284
Good morning!

1493
01:41:54,181 --> 01:41:56,252
Good morning Jackie Chan

1494
01:41:58,185 --> 01:41:59,459
Anything special today?

1495
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,590
Yes

1496
01:42:01,355 --> 01:42:02,425
You

1497
01:42:02,723 --> 01:42:04,669
You're so special

1498
01:42:08,195 --> 01:42:10,402
Okay, I'm special

1499
01:42:20,374 --> 01:42:22,581
So you fix cycles too'?

1500
01:42:23,077 --> 01:42:24,283
I try

1501
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:28,787
And if I can't fix them,
I recycle them

1502
01:42:29,784 --> 01:42:33,425
Recycle a cycle?

1503
01:42:34,488 --> 01:42:38,402
Kaira, you have to
crack better jokes please

1504
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:44,638
So all that cycle
art in your room and...

1505
01:42:45,499 --> 01:42:47,206
Hey, hi by the way!

1506
01:42:47,802 --> 01:42:52,547
This boy was wearing those funky
looking glasses, you made all that?

1507
01:42:52,606 --> 01:42:54,449
Finally! You noticed

1508
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:55,816
He's an artist

1509
01:42:57,645 --> 01:43:03,357
If you can't fix people
do you recycle them too'?

1510
01:43:07,254 --> 01:43:08,392
Bye Jug

1511
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:10,259
Sorry about it

1512
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:12,102
That's so mean

1513
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,537
Yeah that's so mean, let's go

1514
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:19,678
Why cycle today?

1515
01:43:20,201 --> 01:43:21,680
Just breaking the pattern

1516
01:43:21,769 --> 01:43:24,215
Yes, should break it

1517
01:43:25,373 --> 01:43:28,650
You must be going insane
listening to crazy people like me...

1518
01:43:28,743 --> 01:43:30,552
all day inside one room

1519
01:43:31,078 --> 01:43:31,613
Quite possible

1520
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:33,251
Albert Einstein once said...

1521
01:43:33,481 --> 01:43:36,192
"An insane person is one who does
the same thing over and over again...

1522
01:43:36,216 --> 01:43:38,196
and expects different
results each time"

1523
01:43:45,192 --> 01:43:48,765
By the way, Rumi, it's over...

1524
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:50,230
Why?

1525
01:43:50,764 --> 01:43:52,766
Can't do it...

1526
01:43:53,567 --> 01:43:55,444
it's too much

1527
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:58,072
He doesn't fit in my...

1528
01:43:58,405 --> 01:43:59,179
I don't know...

1529
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:01,048
I can't handle it it's too much

1530
01:44:01,175 --> 01:44:02,210
What's too much?

1531
01:44:02,443 --> 01:44:03,251
Too much

1532
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:06,153
<i>Wait wait, Lance Armstrong</i>

1533
01:44:10,084 --> 01:44:12,223
Did Rumi do something wrong?

1534
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:16,664
No we were just wrong
for each other...

1535
01:44:17,191 --> 01:44:18,431
Not this chair

1536
01:44:18,993 --> 01:44:23,135
Shiver! Only happens
when we feel cold...

1537
01:44:23,364 --> 01:44:26,675
or have a fever, or due to weather...

1538
01:44:27,368 --> 01:44:30,679
or sometimes people shiver
when they are scared...

1539
01:44:38,746 --> 01:44:40,350
I just want to be free...

1540
01:44:40,414 --> 01:44:42,690
free from all this

1541
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:45,354
I also want you to be free...

1542
01:44:45,686 --> 01:44:47,427
free from your fears

1543
01:44:47,554 --> 01:44:48,692
Free!

1544
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:51,134
Oh wow

1545
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:55,341
Help me

1546
01:44:56,731 --> 01:44:58,733
Damn, our time's up

1547
01:44:59,233 --> 01:44:59,472
What?

1548
01:44:59,533 --> 01:45:01,171
Got to go! Sorry

1549
01:45:01,235 --> 01:45:02,373
Jug!

1550
01:45:05,072 --> 01:45:06,983
Get my glasses please

1551
01:45:13,347 --> 01:45:15,122
My darling boy, all good?

1552
01:45:15,182 --> 01:45:16,320
Yes all good

1553
01:45:16,384 --> 01:45:19,627
Kiddo! Spend some time with me now,
not fair...

1554
01:45:19,687 --> 01:45:21,598
Sorry, I was getting ready...

1555
01:45:21,655 --> 01:45:23,601
you know it's my party,
I have to look nice

1556
01:45:23,758 --> 01:45:24,758
You look nice

1557
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:28,067
So are you part of this matchmaking?

1558
01:45:28,128 --> 01:45:28,572
Me?

1559
01:45:28,629 --> 01:45:29,437
Yes you

1560
01:45:29,496 --> 01:45:33,444
I have no clue but
I want to see the fun

1561
01:45:34,034 --> 01:45:36,776
Sweet boy Kiddo

1562
01:45:37,605 --> 01:45:41,246
And you,
is your best friend Jackie here?

1563
01:45:41,308 --> 01:45:44,414
Is she still single or...

1564
01:45:44,745 --> 01:45:49,524
Yes, she's still very
much single and so is Kaira

1565
01:45:50,284 --> 01:45:52,560
Please stop, it's starting to hurt

1566
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:54,463
Kaira, come

1567
01:45:59,326 --> 01:46:01,033
I want to introduce
you to a young man

1568
01:46:02,563 --> 01:46:03,633
This is my niece, Kaira

1569
01:46:03,697 --> 01:46:05,677
Hi Kaira, Suresh

1570
01:46:05,733 --> 01:46:07,110
Suresh

1571
01:46:07,268 --> 01:46:08,268
Pleasure

1572
01:46:08,502 --> 01:46:09,981
Well I'll see you'll later then

1573
01:46:10,037 --> 01:46:11,380
Alright, cheers

1574
01:46:12,039 --> 01:46:13,039
Cheers

1575
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:19,216
So you're a photographer right?

1576
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:21,983
Cinematographer actually

1577
01:46:22,082 --> 01:46:23,322
One and the same thing

1578
01:46:23,517 --> 01:46:24,527
No, it's not the same thing

1579
01:46:24,551 --> 01:46:25,325
It's not?
- No

1580
01:46:25,386 --> 01:46:26,386
Okay

1581
01:46:27,321 --> 01:46:28,595
What do you do?

1582
01:46:29,256 --> 01:46:30,360
I'm a techie...

1583
01:46:32,326 --> 01:46:34,397
does that sound boring?

1584
01:46:34,462 --> 01:46:35,065
Fun

1585
01:46:35,195 --> 01:46:37,766
It's fun, then cheers

1586
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:46,283
So, why should I be interested in you?

1587
01:46:48,108 --> 01:46:50,349
That was pretty direct right?

1588
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:58,789
I can be interesting
if I meet an interesting girl...

1589
01:46:59,754 --> 01:47:01,062
it depends

1590
01:47:01,422 --> 01:47:02,560
Okay

1591
01:47:04,191 --> 01:47:06,671
See Kiddo, your favourite food

1592
01:47:06,994 --> 01:47:07,994
Thank you

1593
01:47:08,529 --> 01:47:13,603
What a sweet child Kiddo was,
never used to cry

1594
01:47:15,636 --> 01:47:19,277
Never left my side, always 'Mama Mama'

1595
01:47:19,473 --> 01:47:21,680
Well I figured 'Mama Mama'...

1596
01:47:21,742 --> 01:47:26,213
was a better way to get
what I wanted than to cry

1597
01:47:27,281 --> 01:47:29,227
l-low fast these Kids grow up

1598
01:47:29,283 --> 01:47:29,693
I know

1599
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:33,562
Look at Kiddo, he has achieved
so much at a young age

1600
01:47:34,154 --> 01:47:37,328
He has got a scholarship
for a higher degree...

1601
01:47:37,391 --> 01:47:40,372
then an internship with a big firm...

1602
01:47:40,428 --> 01:47:42,101
tell them the name
of the company, Kiddo

1603
01:47:42,162 --> 01:47:45,336
Dad, just stop it now

1604
01:47:46,701 --> 01:47:48,578
You will definitely be successful

1605
01:47:48,736 --> 01:47:51,216
You are doing the correct thing

1606
01:47:54,308 --> 01:47:56,083
You're not eating anything...

1607
01:47:56,177 --> 01:47:57,781
are you dieting again?

1608
01:47:58,179 --> 01:47:59,590
I don't feel like

1609
01:47:59,713 --> 01:48:01,021
Eat something

1610
01:48:02,483 --> 01:48:04,429
Fine, give it to me

1611
01:48:04,685 --> 01:48:06,221
Here have this

1612
01:48:06,954 --> 01:48:11,061
You remember Chanda,
Kiddo was such a gentle, quiet boy...

1613
01:48:11,325 --> 01:48:14,465
but Kaira, a real firecracker...

1614
01:48:14,528 --> 01:48:16,508
she's still the same

1615
01:48:16,697 --> 01:48:18,375
Firecracker yes,
you're absolutely right...

1616
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:22,973
anger, tantrums and sulking,
most of all with me

1617
01:48:23,237 --> 01:48:28,277
You kids have no idea how
tough it is to be a parent...

1618
01:48:28,475 --> 01:48:32,048
and it's never ending

1619
01:48:32,246 --> 01:48:34,487
Once a parent always a parent

1620
01:48:34,548 --> 01:48:35,253
I agree

1621
01:48:35,316 --> 01:48:37,318
No holiday from this job, right Ashu?

1622
01:48:37,384 --> 01:48:39,421
<i>All parents should be awarded
a President's Award</i>

1623
01:48:39,553 --> 01:48:40,463
Huh?

1624
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:41,625
I love the food

1625
01:48:43,157 --> 01:48:44,465
So end it then

1626
01:48:44,692 --> 01:48:45,692
Just end it

1627
01:48:46,327 --> 01:48:47,032
What?

1628
01:48:47,094 --> 01:48:49,370
The job of being a parent, just end it

1629
01:48:50,597 --> 01:48:54,272
You keep going on and on about
how 'tough' it is, so just end it

1630
01:48:55,336 --> 01:48:57,577
Who has forced you
to continue being parents?

1631
01:48:57,771 --> 01:48:58,772
Has anyone forced you to?

1632
01:48:59,273 --> 01:49:04,018
You didn't start the job well in
the first place so why continue it...

1633
01:49:04,078 --> 01:49:05,523
just put an end to it!

1634
01:49:07,381 --> 01:49:11,955
When kids need you the most
you happily leave them and go

1635
01:49:12,019 --> 01:49:13,726
and then complain
about their tantrums...

1636
01:49:13,987 --> 01:49:17,093
'Oh how angry she gets, makes faces'

1637
01:49:18,192 --> 01:49:21,366
It was your idea to
bring us into the world...

1638
01:49:21,428 --> 01:49:23,704
you treated us the way you wanted...

1639
01:49:23,964 --> 01:49:27,605
and then you blame
us for how we behave...

1640
01:49:27,668 --> 01:49:28,748
and you say it's 'tough'...

1641
01:49:29,002 --> 01:49:30,208
What do you mean by 'tough?

1642
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:31,408
Tough my foot!

1643
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:38,280
L-low could you just abandon me'?

1644
01:49:41,315 --> 01:49:42,692
L-low could you just do that'?

1645
01:49:46,287 --> 01:49:47,732
L-low could you just do that'?

1646
01:49:48,122 --> 01:49:50,363
L-low could you both leave me and go'?

1647
01:49:51,092 --> 01:49:54,665
And the only reason you took me back
was because I failed the 2nd grade...

1648
01:49:54,728 --> 01:49:56,571
yes, I failed the 2nd grade!

1649
01:49:56,631 --> 01:49:58,304
Shame Shame!

1650
01:49:58,366 --> 01:50:01,040
Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!

1651
01:50:01,369 --> 01:50:03,542
Such an embarrassment for you...

1652
01:50:03,604 --> 01:50:06,380
that you left everything
and came back to India?

1653
01:50:08,509 --> 01:50:13,185
And when I was finally happy
living with my grandparents,

1654
01:50:13,281 --> 01:50:15,124
you dragged me away from there too

1655
01:50:15,549 --> 01:50:16,789
You separated me even from them

1656
01:50:17,017 --> 01:50:18,017
Yes

1657
01:50:18,452 --> 01:50:20,762
<i>President's Award just for that!</i>

1658
01:50:25,459 --> 01:50:26,979
And I have a firecracking
news for you!

1659
01:50:27,027 --> 01:50:28,529
Actually a bomb!

1660
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:29,799
Are you ready?

1661
01:50:30,398 --> 01:50:32,571
I have begun therapy!

1662
01:50:34,135 --> 01:50:36,775
Yes! I am seeing a 'Brain Doctor'

1663
01:50:37,171 --> 01:50:39,412
So feel free to call me crazy, mad

1664
01:50:39,473 --> 01:50:41,714
Please say it to me
right now say it to my face

1665
01:50:42,209 --> 01:50:43,051
Say it!

1666
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:44,817
I'm crazy! 'Kukoooo'

1667
01:50:45,079 --> 01:50:47,116
'Kaira's gone mad!'

1668
01:50:52,587 --> 01:50:55,124
That's what you think...

1669
01:50:58,192 --> 01:50:59,603
that people like me are crazy

1670
01:51:09,736 --> 01:51:11,374
She is a bit emotional right now...

1671
01:51:12,739 --> 01:51:14,343
she is also out of work

1672
01:51:14,408 --> 01:51:15,408
Dad, she has enough work

1673
01:51:16,643 --> 01:51:18,680
She has chosen not to work right now

1674
01:51:23,317 --> 01:51:26,423
Kiddo, go get her

1675
01:51:26,587 --> 01:51:27,588
Don't worry

1676
01:51:27,654 --> 01:51:29,133
Make her understand that...

1677
01:51:29,657 --> 01:51:32,570
once your parents moved back,
she never failed in school again...

1678
01:51:33,494 --> 01:51:36,771
so they took the right decision

1679
01:51:37,665 --> 01:51:39,645
There are all kinds of failures...

1680
01:51:41,302 --> 01:51:42,702
and I am looking at a few right now

1681
01:52:15,102 --> 01:52:16,102
You okay?

1682
01:52:18,172 --> 01:52:19,378
I don't know

1683
01:52:31,185 --> 01:52:33,165
Were you happy as a child?

1684
01:52:34,388 --> 01:52:36,188
I only remember being
happy once you came home

1685
01:52:42,797 --> 01:52:44,299
See this

1686
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,309
Where did you find that?

1687
01:52:49,303 --> 01:52:51,044
I was looking for
something from my past...

1688
01:52:51,706 --> 01:52:53,208
and found something from ours instead

1689
01:53:06,721 --> 01:53:07,721
You know...

1690
01:53:08,021 --> 01:53:11,628
As children, when we are sad,
our elders tell us not to cry

1691
01:53:12,026 --> 01:53:15,064
When we are angry,
they tell us 'give us a smile'

1692
01:53:15,362 --> 01:53:17,103
You know why?

1693
01:53:17,732 --> 01:53:19,712
Just to keep the peace at home

1694
01:53:20,267 --> 01:53:23,271
When we wanted to hate
they didn't allow us...

1695
01:53:24,271 --> 01:53:25,545
so now when we want to love...

1696
01:53:25,606 --> 01:53:30,351
we suddenly find our whole
emotional system is topsy-turvy...

1697
01:53:31,178 --> 01:53:32,657
it cannot function

1698
01:53:34,048 --> 01:53:35,652
Sadness, anger, hate...

1699
01:53:36,283 --> 01:53:38,229
we were not allowed
to express anything...

1700
01:53:39,487 --> 01:53:41,023
so now, how do we express love'?

1701
01:53:47,695 --> 01:53:52,041
It's okay to be angry sometimes,
even with parents...

1702
01:53:52,733 --> 01:53:53,773
It's good, it's healthy...

1703
01:53:54,468 --> 01:53:56,778
it's okay Kaira...

1704
01:54:11,085 --> 01:54:15,500
They left me at my grandparents' house

1705
01:54:19,593 --> 01:54:22,335
Mom told me this was like a vacation,
that I would join them soon

1706
01:54:25,666 --> 01:54:30,376
Dad's export business
in Goa had failed...

1707
01:54:31,405 --> 01:54:37,219
so he went to Africa, Middle East
looking for business opportunities...

1708
01:54:37,411 --> 01:54:38,583
mom went with him

1709
01:54:41,749 --> 01:54:46,164
In the beginning I was happy
staying with my grandparents...

1710
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,666
in their big old house in Vasco

1711
01:55:07,108 --> 01:55:10,021
I would write a letter
to mom and dad every week...

1712
01:55:11,578 --> 01:55:13,114
sometimes even twice a week

1713
01:55:15,549 --> 01:55:22,728
At that age, 'writing'
meant drawing some pictures...

1714
01:55:23,224 --> 01:55:25,431
trying to write some big words...

1715
01:55:28,095 --> 01:55:31,599
but every letter ended
with the same question...

1716
01:55:34,435 --> 01:55:36,005
'When will you come back?'

1717
01:55:40,408 --> 01:55:41,408
I was 5 years old...

1718
01:55:43,277 --> 01:55:47,783
every week I would drop my letters
in the mailbox with my grandad...

1719
01:55:48,215 --> 01:55:51,492
then I would wait for a letter

1720
01:55:52,452 --> 01:55:54,432
wait for an answer to my question...

1721
01:56:00,294 --> 01:56:01,466
but it never came

1722
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:09,503
When they called once a month,
they had some excuse each time...

1723
01:56:11,505 --> 01:56:16,682
something about 'an address change, no post
office close by, feeling unwell' etc etc

1724
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:21,287
but I still kept writing

1725
01:56:24,051 --> 01:56:26,171
And my grandad would keep
walking me to the mailbox...

1726
01:56:26,754 --> 01:56:31,032
he always said that I will
get my answer some day soon

1727
01:56:34,662 --> 01:56:38,166
Then, a year later
mom visited me in Goa...

1728
01:56:40,101 --> 01:56:43,548
with my new baby brother, Kiddo

1729
01:56:47,741 --> 01:56:48,741
I was jealous

1730
01:56:51,111 --> 01:56:55,025
Because he got to be with
mom all the time, and not me

1731
01:56:57,685 --> 01:57:03,294
then mom said that I would be away
from them for 'just a little longer'

1732
01:57:05,259 --> 01:57:06,670
so I was still fine with it...

1733
01:57:09,163 --> 01:57:12,610
I remember asking my
mom if she got my last letter

1734
01:57:14,168 --> 01:57:18,708
she said that it was so beautiful that
she put it up on the refrigerator...

1735
01:57:18,973 --> 01:57:20,333
so that she could see it every day

1736
01:57:20,674 --> 01:57:22,278
I was so happy...

1737
01:57:24,044 --> 01:57:28,322
I ran to my room so I could
write another letter for her...

1738
01:57:29,016 --> 01:57:32,259
so I could see her get
happy in front of my own eyes

1739
01:57:32,519 --> 01:57:35,500
A scene I had imagined
in my head many times

1740
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:40,437
So I took out my colours and paints...

1741
01:57:41,195 --> 01:57:46,372
drew a picture and
ran to show it to her

1742
01:57:47,367 --> 01:57:51,713
As I was about to enter the room I
heard my grandad shouting at my mom...

1743
01:57:52,406 --> 01:57:56,616
he was telling her that what
she was doing was not right...

1744
01:57:56,743 --> 01:57:59,024
how could she not respond
to my question, to my letters...

1745
01:57:59,513 --> 01:58:02,392
and then, I heard my mom reply...

1746
01:58:04,151 --> 01:58:09,328
"I can't give her false hope...

1747
01:58:11,092 --> 01:58:15,370
the truth is that we can't
take her back just <i>yet...</i>

1748
01:58:16,564 --> 01:58:18,441
not until the business is set up...

1749
01:58:19,433 --> 01:58:21,640
It is too tough to
handle two children...

1750
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:25,482
and travel constantly blah blah

1751
01:58:27,675 --> 01:58:29,086
But everything just seemed to...

1752
01:58:30,444 --> 01:58:31,444
fade away...

1753
01:58:38,519 --> 01:58:41,090
It was a strange feeling...

1754
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:49,297
like someone had grabbed
the TV remote from me...

1755
01:58:50,531 --> 01:58:56,447
and changed the channel from something
I loved to something horrid...

1756
01:58:58,238 --> 01:59:00,013
and then threw out the remote

1757
01:59:04,579 --> 01:59:10,086
I went back to my room,
tore up the letter...

1758
01:59:13,654 --> 01:59:14,654
I was 6...

1759
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:19,364
took a decision as a 6 year old...

1760
01:59:21,095 --> 01:59:25,510
that I had nothing more to
say to them, nothing more to ask...

1761
01:59:32,506 --> 01:59:34,546
I didn't write a letter
ever again in my entire life

1762
01:59:35,509 --> 01:59:36,509
Never

1763
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:44,527
My poor grandad kept
trying to get me to write...

1764
01:59:46,153 --> 01:59:48,463
but I knew I had nothing
to say to my parents...

1765
01:59:50,758 --> 01:59:52,738
or to anyone else...

1766
01:59:55,629 --> 01:59:56,699
I just became quiet

1767
01:59:58,733 --> 01:59:59,733
I shut down

1768
02:00:07,308 --> 02:00:09,988
Then a year later my mom said
that they were coming back for good...

1769
02:00:12,446 --> 02:00:16,690
dad's friend had a business
partnership for him in Goa itself

1770
02:00:18,752 --> 02:00:22,199
In all these years, dad couldn't
set up his business abroad

1771
02:00:23,057 --> 02:00:27,563
So imagine, all this for nothing

1772
02:00:30,031 --> 02:00:31,271
So they came back

1773
02:00:33,267 --> 02:00:37,579
But that year was the
most stressful for me...

1774
02:00:40,708 --> 02:00:42,244
I didn't want to be with them

1775
02:00:44,745 --> 02:00:46,554
I wanted to stay with my grandparents

1776
02:00:48,549 --> 02:00:50,256
They were separating me from them too

1777
02:00:52,353 --> 02:00:53,661
I threw tantrums...

1778
02:00:53,721 --> 02:00:57,259
cried a lot, troubled everyone

1779
02:00:57,792 --> 02:01:00,068
To top it all,
I failed the 2nd grade...

1780
02:01:01,162 --> 02:01:05,304
and that, not my 100 letters...

1781
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:10,045
not the fact that I was their
daughter living away from them

1782
02:01:10,438 --> 02:01:13,442
But my failure made them
take me away from my grandparents...

1783
02:01:14,074 --> 02:01:16,020
and back with them finally

1784
02:01:46,807 --> 02:01:48,718
I'm sorry

1785
02:01:53,281 --> 02:01:54,783
I'm sorry

1786
02:01:58,619 --> 02:02:04,126
If you don't cry wholeheartedly,
how will you laugh wholeheartedly?

1787
02:02:04,392 --> 02:02:06,429
It's okay...

1788
02:02:13,401 --> 02:02:16,780
I'm not much for rules...

1789
02:02:17,037 --> 02:02:21,349
but because of the rules...

1790
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:28,092
I can't pop a champagne
bottle to celebrate this moment...

1791
02:02:28,316 --> 02:02:31,297
but we can do the next best thing

1792
02:02:42,596 --> 02:02:44,303
To letters, Kaira

1793
02:02:44,365 --> 02:02:45,366
Cheers!

1794
02:02:48,202 --> 02:02:49,306
Go easy...

1795
02:03:03,016 --> 02:03:07,988
To feel safe,
first the fears have to go

1796
02:03:09,323 --> 02:03:12,065
The fear of being abandoned,
of being left alone...

1797
02:03:14,328 --> 02:03:17,571
You have carried this
fear with you all your life...

1798
02:03:18,999 --> 02:03:26,999
this burden is falling on all your
relationships, especially on your love life

1799
02:03:28,609 --> 02:03:32,421
So you leave others
before they can leave you

1800
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:37,320
You want to say bye
before they can say bye

1801
02:03:39,319 --> 02:03:44,359
Because you never want
to face that pain again

1802
02:03:47,228 --> 02:03:48,639
So, Kaira

1803
02:03:50,598 --> 02:03:56,514
Why not say bye to
this fear once and for all?

1804
02:03:58,406 --> 02:04:03,719
Why not say hi to life once again?

1805
02:04:08,282 --> 02:04:13,561
I am not saying that you
should forgive your parents...

1806
02:04:13,721 --> 02:04:15,462
or even to stop being angry...

1807
02:04:15,523 --> 02:04:17,469
you do as you wish

1808
02:04:17,758 --> 02:04:19,260
But I will say this...

1809
02:04:19,493 --> 02:04:24,408
try to look at them not in
the exalted status of parents...

1810
02:04:26,367 --> 02:04:28,745
but just as two regular people...

1811
02:04:30,704 --> 02:04:36,382
who make mistakes, like everyone else

1812
02:04:37,478 --> 02:04:39,355
As a child it is hard
to understand all this...

1813
02:04:39,413 --> 02:04:41,359
but now, as an adult...

1814
02:04:41,582 --> 02:04:43,493
you can at least try

1815
02:04:47,155 --> 02:04:54,403
Don't let the past blackmail your
present to ruin a beautiful future

1816
02:05:11,745 --> 02:05:14,726
<i>When something touches your heart</i>

1817
02:05:15,549 --> 02:05:19,258
<i>Say hi to</i> it...

1818
02:05:20,487 --> 02:05:24,230
<i>When your heart is not in it</i>

1819
02:05:24,391 --> 02:05:28,271
Say bye to it...

1820
02:05:29,163 --> 02:05:31,165
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1821
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:33,336
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1822
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:36,142
<i>Say hi to happiness</i>

1823
02:05:37,671 --> 02:05:39,776
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1824
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:42,111
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1825
02:05:42,176 --> 02:05:49,253
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1826
02:05:49,717 --> 02:05:52,789
<i>Love you life</i>

1827
02:05:54,221 --> 02:06:02,221
<i>Love you life</i>

1828
02:06:02,697 --> 02:06:08,704
<i>Love me life</i>

1829
02:06:27,455 --> 02:06:30,732
Koko, I'm sorry

1830
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:34,300
I'm sorry

1831
02:06:37,464 --> 02:06:37,999
Hello?

1832
02:06:38,065 --> 02:06:40,477
Hi Ma'am, I am calling from eBay,
are you happy with our services?

1833
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:41,501
Yes why?

1834
02:06:41,569 --> 02:06:44,482
Please do continue shopping with us

1835
02:06:44,538 --> 02:06:45,538
Thank you

1836
02:07:01,255 --> 02:07:08,969
<i>Sometimes hold my hand,
and walk with me</i>

1837
02:07:09,363 --> 02:07:15,644
Sometimes leave <i>my hand,</i>
and let me go free

1838
02:07:18,472 --> 02:07:20,247
<i>I'm</i> a <i>little moody</i>

1839
02:07:20,607 --> 02:07:22,484
<i>You're</i> a <i>little crazy</i>

1840
02:07:22,543 --> 02:07:26,719
<i>What a pair we are</i>

1841
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:29,085
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1842
02:07:29,149 --> 02:07:31,254
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1843
02:07:31,318 --> 02:07:35,494
<i>Say hi to happiness...</i>

1844
02:07:35,556 --> 02:07:37,695
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1845
02:07:37,758 --> 02:07:39,999
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1846
02:07:40,061 --> 02:07:47,001
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1847
02:07:47,601 --> 02:07:55,601
<i>Love you life</i>

1848
02:08:00,748 --> 02:08:05,163
<i>Love me life</i>

1849
02:08:07,254 --> 02:08:10,497
You are different...

1850
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:16,233
you listen to me, you really listen

1851
02:08:18,198 --> 02:08:21,475
I wish I had someone
like you in my life...

1852
02:08:21,669 --> 02:08:23,376
Am I making sense?

1853
02:08:23,737 --> 02:08:27,275
Not at all,
but that will be 3000 rupees please

1854
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:17,068
Where were you?

1855
02:09:17,425 --> 02:09:18,733
Just disappeared

1856
02:09:19,259 --> 02:09:22,399
I have to give proper
notice if I miss a session...

1857
02:09:22,463 --> 02:09:26,172
and you left me with one small note

1858
02:09:26,233 --> 02:09:28,304
'Sorry'... that's not fair

1859
02:09:28,369 --> 02:09:31,350
I know, life is unfair

1860
02:09:32,306 --> 02:09:33,410
Fine

1861
02:09:34,508 --> 02:09:35,646
Hide all your secrets

1862
02:09:42,149 --> 02:09:43,093
You know...

1863
02:09:43,150 --> 02:09:47,030
my issues with my
parents may get sorted...

1864
02:09:47,321 --> 02:09:51,030
but with men!

1865
02:09:51,291 --> 02:09:53,396
I am never going to find anyone

1866
02:10:00,501 --> 02:10:01,639
Tell me something

1867
02:10:03,638 --> 02:10:08,144
ls there such a thing
as a perfect relationship?

1868
02:10:08,375 --> 02:10:12,323
Like just one special relationship?

1869
02:10:14,715 --> 02:10:16,626
Kaira I think...

1870
02:10:17,418 --> 02:10:22,128
why just that one
special relationship?

1871
02:10:22,757 --> 02:10:25,067
I think one can have
many relationships in life...

1872
02:10:25,125 --> 02:10:27,605
different relationships
for different experiences...

1873
02:10:27,661 --> 02:10:31,666
like a musical relationship...

1874
02:10:32,133 --> 02:10:36,548
someone who shares
our interest in music...

1875
02:10:37,204 --> 02:10:40,378
or the lets-get-coffee-together
relationship...

1876
02:10:40,675 --> 02:10:45,784
perfect to have coffee with...
but not anything else...

1877
02:10:47,081 --> 02:10:49,391
Special gossip relationship...

1878
02:10:49,450 --> 02:10:52,590
with whom you can
have the perfect gossip

1879
02:10:53,154 --> 02:10:56,158
Or the special
intellectual relationship...

1880
02:10:56,323 --> 02:11:00,066
for all those perfect
bookish discussions...

1881
02:11:01,095 --> 02:11:05,202
So many different,
special relationships...

1882
02:11:10,004 --> 02:11:14,783
The romantic relationship
is just one of many

1883
02:11:16,110 --> 02:11:21,110
To expect a single relationship
to take on the burden of every need...

1884
02:11:27,354 --> 02:11:29,527
a bit unfair, right?

1885
02:11:36,463 --> 02:11:38,033
Never thought of it this way

1886
02:11:47,608 --> 02:11:49,383
I'm glad the camera is back

1887
02:11:49,443 --> 02:11:50,751
Me too

1888
02:11:58,552 --> 02:12:04,025
Jug, do you want to get
a cup of coffee or something?

1889
02:12:04,558 --> 02:12:08,233
No, our time's up

1890
02:12:11,666 --> 02:12:14,112
You won't bunk the next session right'?

1891
02:12:14,268 --> 02:12:16,248
It is the last week of our sessions...

1892
02:12:16,704 --> 02:12:18,377
how can I miss that?

1893
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:51,773
So, done sulking with Goa?

1894
02:12:52,372 --> 02:12:53,510
No more sulking

1895
02:12:55,442 --> 02:12:56,819
What about your work?

1896
02:12:57,111 --> 02:12:59,352
Actually I got an offer

1897
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:01,180
What?

1898
02:13:01,649 --> 02:13:05,392
A production company is interested
in funding my short film...

1899
02:13:05,686 --> 02:13:10,658
so I am thinking,
why not stay back here and shoot it

1900
02:13:23,671 --> 02:13:27,448
Since it's the final class,
have I passed?

1901
02:13:28,308 --> 02:13:31,653
This isn't school, to pass or fail

1902
02:13:34,281 --> 02:13:37,387
I wish there were teachers
like you in school

1903
02:13:37,751 --> 02:13:39,526
I'm no teacher

1904
02:13:40,054 --> 02:13:42,398
Okay not teacher but...

1905
02:13:43,223 --> 02:13:44,531
you know what I mean

1906
02:13:45,126 --> 02:13:49,131
We are all our own teachers
in the school of life

1907
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:51,601
Okay, that got a bit heavy

1908
02:13:53,267 --> 02:13:58,239
Life is like a jigsaw puzzle

1909
02:13:58,672 --> 02:14:03,212
People like me can help
you find the missing pieces...

1910
02:14:03,377 --> 02:14:06,290
and put them back together...

1911
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:11,093
but, only you can complete the puzzle

1912
02:14:20,060 --> 02:14:25,305
So now that this is over...

1913
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:34,449
can we meet outside of this...

1914
02:14:35,576 --> 02:14:38,352
just as friends or something?

1915
02:14:38,613 --> 02:14:41,219
No this is not possible Kaira

1916
02:14:41,348 --> 02:14:44,386
And what if I tell you...

1917
02:14:45,052 --> 02:14:46,793
that I like you...

1918
02:14:51,058 --> 02:14:52,128
In fact...

1919
02:14:56,197 --> 02:14:58,268
Go on, I'm listening

1920
02:15:01,202 --> 02:15:03,546
In fact I really like you

1921
02:15:06,674 --> 02:15:09,211
That's it, said it

1922
02:15:13,114 --> 02:15:15,151
I really like you too

1923
02:15:16,316 --> 02:15:18,193
I really like you

1924
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:21,326
I respect your feelings...

1925
02:15:21,989 --> 02:15:25,163
but my job here is done for now

1926
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:32,100
As unconventional and friendly
as my methods may be...

1927
02:15:32,366 --> 02:15:36,246
I am still your therapist...

1928
02:15:37,404 --> 02:15:43,616
any other 'friendship' would be outside
the realm of my own professional ethics

1929
02:15:47,448 --> 02:15:54,297
The closeness that you may feel to me,
your 'BD'...

1930
02:15:54,355 --> 02:15:57,029
is very normal

1931
02:15:59,426 --> 02:16:04,034
This happens, it's common

1932
02:16:04,198 --> 02:16:05,142
So I'm common?

1933
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:09,147
No, you are not common

1934
02:16:09,269 --> 02:16:11,681
You are different, special...

1935
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:13,575
you are unique

1936
02:16:15,509 --> 02:16:16,351
You know Kaira

1937
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:23,328
People feel all sorts
of strong emotions in here...

1938
02:16:23,551 --> 02:16:27,124
anger, hate, love

1939
02:16:28,088 --> 02:16:30,694
I shouldn't have said anything

1940
02:16:30,758 --> 02:16:32,669
No, you should have

1941
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:37,099
It's really good
you said what you said

1942
02:16:37,765 --> 02:16:42,510
You expressed your
difficult feelings...

1943
02:16:42,569 --> 02:16:47,075
in a straightforward
and mature manner...

1944
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:51,117
rather than letting them fester...

1945
02:16:51,278 --> 02:16:54,225
inside of you...

1946
02:16:55,049 --> 02:16:56,494
and we don't want that...

1947
02:16:56,717 --> 02:16:57,717
<i>No</i>

1948
02:17:01,021 --> 02:17:05,128
This Kaira, is huge progress

1949
02:17:19,473 --> 02:17:22,716
Okay but, tell me one thing

1950
02:17:23,177 --> 02:17:24,986
l-low can this be the last session'?

1951
02:17:25,045 --> 02:17:27,389
No no...

1952
02:17:28,715 --> 02:17:30,422
No more stories?

1953
02:17:31,085 --> 02:17:34,328
So many new problems I will have...

1954
02:17:35,189 --> 02:17:40,298
Yes there will be many problems...

1955
02:17:40,995 --> 02:17:47,344
but now you know how to solve them

1956
02:17:51,338 --> 02:17:53,614
But I'll need help

1957
02:17:55,242 --> 02:17:57,051
I need you

1958
02:18:04,585 --> 02:18:05,655
Kaira...

1959
02:18:06,487 --> 02:18:08,967
when you see a pattern
emerging in life...

1960
02:18:09,356 --> 02:18:14,999
a habit,
then it's time to think about it

1961
02:18:15,396 --> 02:18:18,639
Genius is about knowing when to stop

1962
02:19:25,533 --> 02:19:26,705
Okay then

1963
02:21:29,289 --> 02:21:34,261
Baby Fatima, can't believe it

1964
02:21:37,064 --> 02:21:42,412
<i>This is your godmother, Kokomaa</i>

1965
02:21:50,644 --> 02:21:53,591
Battle after battle

1966
02:21:54,248 --> 02:21:59,129
Corporal Balthazar fought
in the Portuguese army for 14 years

1967
02:22:00,621 --> 02:22:05,036
Nobody knew that Corporal
Balthazar was not Balthazar...

1968
02:22:05,092 --> 02:22:08,096
but Dona Maria, a woman...

1969
02:22:08,462 --> 02:22:11,375
disguised as a man

1970
02:22:11,632 --> 02:22:17,605
This was the only way for a woman
to safeguard her life and dignity

1971
02:22:17,772 --> 02:22:21,345
For 14 years Dona Maria
fought two battles...

1972
02:22:21,408 --> 02:22:25,220
one on the battlefield,
and the other with herself...

1973
02:22:25,412 --> 02:22:28,325
with her fears

1974
02:22:28,382 --> 02:22:31,659
Finally, one day on the battlefield,
her true identity was revealed

1975
02:22:32,152 --> 02:22:33,187
As fate would have it...

1976
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:36,096
in front of Captain Aphonso...

1977
02:22:42,162 --> 02:22:43,470
Captain Aphonso...

1978
02:22:43,630 --> 02:22:46,304
Commander of the fort and a doctor...

1979
02:22:46,466 --> 02:22:48,104
not only saved Dona Maria's life...

1980
02:22:48,168 --> 02:22:49,374
and nursed her wounds...

1981
02:22:49,503 --> 02:22:52,143
but made her fears disappear...

1982
02:22:52,773 --> 02:22:56,744
and freed her from the
ghost of Corporal Balthazar

1983
02:22:59,180 --> 02:23:00,784
For the first time...

1984
02:23:01,048 --> 02:23:03,756
Dona Maria had the courage
to face her true self

1985
02:23:04,484 --> 02:23:09,024
Finally she felt free, she felt alive

1986
02:23:11,391 --> 02:23:18,309
With her newfound courage,
Dona Maria soon became Commander...

1987
02:23:18,498 --> 02:23:22,139
the first woman Commander
of the Portuguese army...

1988
02:23:24,204 --> 02:23:26,582
Now, Donna Maria fought
only one battle...

1989
02:23:27,274 --> 02:23:30,585
the one on the battlefield

1990
02:24:24,098 --> 02:24:25,577
Speech! Speech!

1991
02:24:25,632 --> 02:24:28,545
No speech, just shut up!

1992
02:24:29,703 --> 02:24:32,183
It was beautiful my darling

1993
02:24:34,074 --> 02:24:36,076
So proud of you

1994
02:24:40,547 --> 02:24:41,719
Beautiful film

1995
02:24:42,182 --> 02:24:42,489
Really?

1996
02:24:42,583 --> 02:24:43,583
Very impressed

1997
02:24:44,685 --> 02:24:48,155
People who make music with
the camera don't need musicians

1998
02:24:51,224 --> 02:24:53,568
I wrote a song for you,
want to listen?

1999
02:24:54,361 --> 02:24:55,635
Just kidding

2000
02:24:57,431 --> 02:24:58,501
I'm proud of you

2001
02:24:59,266 --> 02:25:01,507
You gave Kaira her first break right?

2002
02:25:01,568 --> 02:25:02,568
Yes

2003
02:25:02,603 --> 02:25:04,742
She could not have
done this without you

2004
02:25:05,005 --> 02:25:09,545
Actually if I was with her,
she couldn't have done this

2005
02:25:10,544 --> 02:25:12,182
Cheers!

2006
02:25:13,013 --> 02:25:15,584
To the longest project
of this century!

2007
02:25:17,017 --> 02:25:18,257
Cheers to my baby

2008
02:25:23,690 --> 02:25:24,361
Hi!

2009
02:25:24,425 --> 02:25:25,425
Hi!

2010
02:25:26,660 --> 02:25:27,730
I was wondering...

2011
02:25:28,062 --> 02:25:31,066
Yes please tell me,
what were you wondering?

2012
02:25:31,265 --> 02:25:33,370
Would you be able to
live as a man for a few years?

2013
02:25:33,634 --> 02:25:34,634
Huh?

2014
02:25:36,570 --> 02:25:38,607
It's a really interesting concept,
your story

2015
02:25:40,574 --> 02:25:42,054
l-low did you come up with the idea'?

2016
02:25:44,044 --> 02:25:45,044
What's your story?

2017
02:25:46,046 --> 02:25:48,652
Do you make films too?

2018
02:25:48,716 --> 02:25:50,457
No, I make furniture...

2019
02:25:51,084 --> 02:25:53,655
tables, sofas, chairs

2020
02:25:54,421 --> 02:25:55,525
Chairs?

2021
02:25:57,124 --> 02:25:59,229
<i>Like Kursi chairs?</i>

2022
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:01,435
<i>Chairs like Kursi</i>

2023
02:26:01,962 --> 02:26:03,964
<i>Kursi like chairs</i>

2024
02:26:41,602 --> 02:26:42,774
Dear life,

2025
02:26:43,737 --> 02:26:46,616
I know we haven't been
in touch for a while...

2026
02:26:47,675 --> 02:26:49,018
So nothing

2027
02:26:49,710 --> 02:26:51,053
Just wanted to say hi

2028
02:27:04,525 --> 02:27:08,996
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi.</i> ..

2029
02:27:17,525 --> 02:30:08,996
