00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:46,776
Sir, kindly switch off your mobile phone.

5
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:49,026

00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:22,776
Sir, please sit down.

9
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,610
Captain, there's a medical emergency.

10
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,526
A passenger has just
fallen down in the aisle.

11
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:39,526
Delhi, Air lndia 101 returning
due to medical emergency.

12
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:49,401
Excuse me, sir.

13
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:02,985
Hold on!

14
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:16,693
l'm fine now, thanks.
Carry on, please.

15
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,526
Wait.

16
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,235
- Get the car!
- Mr. Dhillon?

17
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,776
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car.

18
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:58,776
To the hotel, sir?

19
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:01,651
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar.

20
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:05,485
Step on the gas, dude!

21
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,276
Yeah, Farhan?

22
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,901
Get ready. l'll pick you up
in five minutes.

23
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:23,110
What happened?

24
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:25,151
Chatur called. Remember him?

25
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,193
The 'Silencer'?

26
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,276
Yeah.

27
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:31,818
He said Rancho is coming.

28
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:34,943
What?

29
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,818
He said - Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank.

30
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:41,360
Oh shucks!

31
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:42,401
Hurry!

32
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:43,735
Ok.

33
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,026
Honey, l'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes.

34
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,110
We found our buddy.

35
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,735
What?

36
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,110
Tell me later - bye.

37
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,443
You forgot your pants.

38
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:13,860
Now to the hotel sir?

39
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:17,068
Yes, but via Imperial College of Engineering.

40
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:18,568
Ok sir.

41
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,610
Forgot my socks.

42
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:21,526
More than just your socks...

43
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,401
your pants.

44
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:24,526
Oh no.

45
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:40,235
Now get my brother
from the airport

46
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,568
Same last name - Dhillon

47
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:45,318
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

48
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,693
Hey Rancho

49
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:08,485
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

50
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,443
Rancho

51
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,276
Where's Rancho?

52
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:14,985
Welcome, idiots

53
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:20,693
Some 'madeira' for you?

54
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:25,443
The same rum you
guzzled those days.

55
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:27,360
Have a drink.

56
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:29,235
Where is Rancho?

57
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,776
Patience. First look at this

58
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,443
Don't eye my wife. Check out
the mansion behind, idiots

59
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:39,693
$ 3.5 million

60
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,818
Swimming pool - heated!

61
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,110
Living room - maple wood flooring

62
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,985
My new Lamborghini 6496 cc -

63
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,776
very fast.

64
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,943
Why're you showing us all this?

65
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:55,485
Forgot?

66
00:06:58,736 --> 00:06:59,610
What's this?

67
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,026
'5th September'. Today's date

68
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,651
l challenge you

69
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:24,068
We'll meet again after ten years

70
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,443
Same day. Same place

71
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:29,693
We'll see who's more successful

72
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:34,776
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

73
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:40,443
Remember? l'd challenged
that idiot right here

74
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:44,068
l kept my promise. l'm back

75
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:48,860
Jackass! l aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

76
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,068
all to meet Rancho

77
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,110
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

78
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,901
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

79
00:07:56,111 --> 00:08:00,235
l know he won't show up

80
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,735
You gonna break his jaw
or should l

81
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,943
So why'd you call us here?

82
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,318
To meet Rancho.

83
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:11,860
Come and see where l've reached
and where he rots

84
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,401
So you know where Rancho is?

85
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,568
Yes.

86
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:18,943
Where?

87
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:21,985
He is in Shimla.

88
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:33,443
Free as the wind was he

89
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:40,276
Like a soaring kite was he

90
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:48,276
Where did he go... let's find him

91
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,485
Free as the wind was he

92
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:11,693
Like a soaring kite was he

93
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:17,193
Where did he go... let's find him

94
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:23,568
We were led by the path we took

95
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:26,943
While he carved a path of his own

96
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:32,526
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

97
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:37,276
We fretted about the morrow

98
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,651
He simply reveled in today

99
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:46,610
Living each moment to the fullest

100
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:51,193
Where did he come from...

101
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:58,526
He who touched our
hearts and vanished...

102
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:05,151
Where did he go... let's find him

103
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,026
ln scorching Sun,
he was like a patch of shade...

104
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:18,401
ln an endless desert, like an oasis...

105
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:23,401
On a bruised heart,
like soothing balm was he

106
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:28,693
Afraid, we stayed confined in the well

107
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,026
Fearless, he frolicked in the river

108
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:37,735
Never hesitating to swim
against the tide

109
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:42,693
He wandered lonesome as a cloud

110
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:47,860
... Yet he was our dearest friend

111
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:53,026
Where did he go... let's find him

112
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,235
Rancho

113
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:56,818
Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

114
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:00,776
He was as unique as his name

115
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:04,318
From birth we were taught -
Life is a race

116
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:07,776
Run fast or you'll be trampled

117
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,318
Even to be born, one had to race
300 million sperms

118
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:18,193
1978. l was born at 5.15 pm

119
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:21,443
At 5.16, my father announced

120
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:26,151
My son will be an engineer.
- Farhan Qureshi. B.Tech. Engineer

121
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:27,776
And my fate was sealed

122
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:33,276
What l wanted to be... no one asked

123
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:58,151
<i>Raju Rastogi...

124
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:00,818

132
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,818

135
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,735
Check him out...
another God-fearing soul.

136
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,735
- Hi. Farhan Qureshi.
- l'm Raju Rastogi.

137
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:51,235
Don't worry.

138
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:55,651
a few days here and
he'll lose faith in God.

139
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:59,610
Then naked babes will be
on the wall, and he'll say -

140
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:03,110
"Oh God, give me one chance with her"

141
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:04,860
Get out of here.

142
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:07,735
Four bucks. Two per bag.

143
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:11,693
Here's five. Keep the change.

144
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:16,151
Thanks boss. For your tip,
here's one in return -

145
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:20,318
Wear your best underwear tonight.

146
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:23,776
Why?

147
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:28,401
Your Majesty, thou art great

148
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:31,610
Accept this humble offering

149
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,735
Ha... here's a He-Man

150
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:39,443
What a pretty piece.
Cute and compact

151
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,235
A campus tradition - On Day 1...

152
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:43,943
Freshmen must pay
their respects to Seniors

153
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:46,318
in their underwear.

154
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:49,860
This is when we first saw Rancho

155
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:00,318
Spiderman

156
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:01,735
Batman

157
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,276
Fresh meat

158
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:14,860
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped

159
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:15,818

160
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,651

161
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:21,818
What a mouthful!
Needs serious cramming

162
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:23,610
Come on - pants off

163
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,943
Being stubborn?

164
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,901
Wet pants not good, kiddo.

00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,068

What did he say?

168
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:45,151
Someone tell him.
Hey James Bond.

169
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:46,485
Make him understand.

170
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:50,401
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you.

171
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:53,068
Hey 007!
Ashamed to speak Hindi?

So explain slowly. No hurry

175

Feeling cold?

176
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,776

Hey, come out of there

00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:36,485

One

186
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:06,901
Two

187
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,401
Three

188
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,276
Four

189
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:31,485
Five

190
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,026
Six

191
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:46,526
Seven

192
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:54,151
Eight

193
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:00,485
Nine

194
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,193
Ten

195
00:17:56,986 --> 00:18:01,526
Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics

196
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,735
We had studied it.
He applied it

197
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:13,985
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of lCE

198
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:17,485
Students called him Virus,
computer Virus

199
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:20,443
Virus on the way, with eggs

200
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:24,235
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

201
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:27,110
Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen

202
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:31,485
He couldn't bear anyone
getting ahead of him

203
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:38,485
To save time,
his shirts had Velcro

204
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:40,151
and his ties had hooks

205
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:46,735
He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously

206
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:54,443
Everyday at 2 pm he took a
71/2 minute power nap

207
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:56,110
with an opera as lullaby

208
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,776
Govind, his valet, had instructions

209
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:07,026
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc

210
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,610
What is this?
- Sir, nest

211
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:29,026
Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

212
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:30,110
Wrong

213
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,026
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

214
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,568
She lays her eggs in
other nests

215
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:41,443
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

216
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:49,026
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

217
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:53,985
Competition over

218
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,860
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

219
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,276
Compete or die

220
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,360
You also are like the koel birds

221
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:15,068
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into lCE

222
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:20,526
Don't forget, lCE gets
400,000 applications a year

223
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:25,068
and only 200 are selected - You!

224
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:30,318
And these? Finished.
Broken eggs

225
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,943
My son... he tried for three years

226
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,360
Rejected. Every time

227
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:43,318
Remember, life is a race

228
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,568
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

229
00:20:48,277 --> 00:20:50,151
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

230
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:53,693
This is an astronaut pen

231
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:57,610
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

232
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:02,693
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

233
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:07,360
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

234
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:09,526
One day, when I was a student

235
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:11,568
the Director of our institute
called me

236
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:14,276
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

237
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:15,860
'Come here!'
I got scared

238
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,443
He showed me this pen

239
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,193
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

240
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,026
'I give it to you'

241
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:30,776
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

242
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:33,068
...pass it onto him'

243
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:38,485
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

244
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,026
But no luck

245
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,860
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

246
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,568
Good.
Put your hands down

247
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:56,651
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

248
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:58,443
One question, sir

249
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,401
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

250
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:06,568
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

251
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,485
They'd have saved millions

252
00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:23,943
I will get back to you on this

253
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,235
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

254
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:33,693
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

255
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:35,943
You deflated Virus's erection

256
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:39,985
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

257
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,568
Buzz off.
You don't have school?

258
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:44,485
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

259
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:47,901
Keep off my dad!
- Relax

260
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:51,901
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

261
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:57,526
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

262
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,818
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

263
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:03,235
If I get caught?
- Then new uniform, new school

264
00:23:04,152 --> 00:23:05,610
See that?
- He was different...

265
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:09,276
He challenged conventions
at every stage

266
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:12,610
A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest

267
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:16,401
We were robots, blindly following
our professors' commands

268
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,651
He was the only one
who was not a machine

269
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:22,276
What is a machine?

270
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:29,235
Why're you smiling?

271
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:33,443
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

272
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,735
I'm so happy to be here finally

273
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:41,151
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

274
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:45,985
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

275
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:47,776
Will you please elaborate?

276
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:56,568
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

277
00:23:58,444 --> 00:24:00,735
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

278
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:02,193
The fan... A machine!

279
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:05,985
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

280
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,235
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

281
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:11,943
We're surrounded by machines

282
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,985
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

283
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,818
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

284
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,110
What is the definition?

285
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,526
I just gave it to you, sir

286
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:29,735
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine - up, down...

287
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,526
Idiot! Anybody else?

288
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:34,110
Yes?

289
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:36,776
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

290
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:38,443
that their relative motions
are constrained

291
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,985
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

292
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,401
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

293
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:46,193
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

294
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,401
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

295
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,401
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

296
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:53,818
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

297
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:56,110
Wonderful

298
00:24:56,402 --> 00:24:57,860
Perfect. Please sit down

299
00:24:58,111 --> 00:24:59,443
Thank you

300
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:03,860
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

301
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:08,026
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

302
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:10,026
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

303
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:13,651
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

304
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:15,526
You think you're smarter
than the book?

305
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:20,860
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

306
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:22,776
But there are other books...
- Get out!

307
00:25:23,777 --> 00:25:25,068
Why?

308
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:27,276
In simple language - Out!

309
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:38,068
Idiot!

310
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:42,610
So, we were discussing
the machine...

311
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,151
Why're you back?

312
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:47,360
I forgot something

313
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:48,860
What?

314
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:52,318
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

315
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:54,735
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated

316
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:56,776
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non jacketed

317
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:58,901
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

318
00:25:58,986 --> 00:26:00,818
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

319
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:02,651
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

320
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:04,901
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

321
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,693
What do you mean?

322
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:14,235
Books, sir

323
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:17,193
I forgot my books. May I?

324
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:19,235
Couldn't you ask simply?

325
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:22,860
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

326
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:31,985
Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in

327
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:35,235
When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another

328
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:39,693
He said - First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it

329
00:26:40,152 --> 00:26:41,485
He was unlike any of us

330
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,110
We fought for a shower
every morning

331
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:46,943
He'd bathe wherever
he found water

332
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:47,985
Morning, sir

333
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:51,693
Machines were his passion

334
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:56,235
When he spotted them,
he opened them

335
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:57,568
Some he could re-assemble...

336
00:26:58,652 --> 00:26:59,985
some he couldn't

337
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:03,360
There was another, just like him

338
00:27:06,152 --> 00:27:07,401
Joy Lobo

339
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,860
Sir. Excuse me, sir

340
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:11,943
Mr. Joy Lobo!

341
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:15,276
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

342
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:16,235
Why?

343
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,151
Dad wants to make
train reservations

344
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:22,026
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

345
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:25,110
In that case, call your dad

346
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,693
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

347
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,151
Hello

348
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:38,318
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

349
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:39,485
Joy!

350
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:42,110
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

351
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:44,610
What happened, sir?

352
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,860
He has violated all deadlines

353
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:50,943
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

354
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:52,985
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

355
00:27:53,277 --> 00:27:57,901
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

356
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,526
Sir, I am this close, sir
- Is your project ready?

357
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:06,901
Is your project ready?
- Sir, see it once, please

358
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:08,651
Submit it, and we'll consider

359
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:11,151
Sir, a small extension...
- Why, why should I?

360
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:14,360
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

361
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,735
Did you stop eating?

362
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,276
No

363
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:18,401
Stopped bathing?

364
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:20,443
So why stop studying?

365
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,276
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

366
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,568
Mr. Lobo!

367
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,776
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

368
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:33,026
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

369
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:38,193
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

370
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,860
Sir... I'm very close...

Dude's come up with an
amazing design

384
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,276
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

385
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:09,776
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

386
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:13,068
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

387
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:15,360
It will fly! We'll make it fly

388
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,860
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

389
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:22,901
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

390
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:25,610
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

391
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:29,193
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

392
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,026
You scare easily, bro

393
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:36,651
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

394
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:39,026
All is well?
- Aal izz well

395
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,693
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchoddas

396
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:44,318
We had an old watchman
in our village

397
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:50,401
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

398
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:54,526
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

399
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:56,776
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

400
00:30:57,069 --> 00:31:00,526
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

401
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,985
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

402
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,818
You have to trick it

403
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:16,776
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

404
00:31:18,027 --> 00:31:19,735
That resolves the problem?

405
00:31:19,986 --> 00:31:21,776
No. But you gain courage to face it

406
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:27,651
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

Take it higher.

455
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:16,485
Look at Silencer - the nude dude!

456
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:21,485
Joy, come out.

457
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:25,068
Come to the window.

458
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:26,651
Joy, look outside.

459
00:36:20,986 --> 00:36:21,860
Good news, sir.

460
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:26,235
The police and Joy's father
have no clue.

461
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:28,860
Everyone thinks this is suicide.

462
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:32,276
The post mortem report -

463
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:34,901
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

464
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,110
resulting in choking

465
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:42,818
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

466
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:47,485
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

467
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:49,360
That's missing in the report.

468
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,985
Engineers are a clever bunch...

469
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:58,776
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure.

470
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:02,568
If they had, all would know...

471
00:37:03,777 --> 00:37:05,193
this isn't suicide... It's murder.

472
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:13,318
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

473
00:37:14,194 --> 00:37:17,026
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

474
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:21,110
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

475
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:25,360
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system.

476
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:30,985
Look at these statistics -
India ranks No.1 in suicides

477
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:35,068
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

478
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:39,651
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

479
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:41,193
Something's terribly wrong, sir.

480
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:43,568
I can't speak for the rest...

481
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:46,193
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

482
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:48,860
I've run this place for 32 years.

483
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:52,651
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're No.1

484
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:54,401
What's the point, sir?

485
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:59,401
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

486
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:06,110
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

487
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:12,318
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

488
00:38:12,486 --> 00:38:14,693
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

489
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:16,068
No sir, I...

490
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,401
Sir, my paper...

491
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:40,401
Vaidyanathan, please sit down.

492
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,068
Here is a self-proclaimed professor.

493
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:49,235
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers.

494
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:54,401
Professor Ranchoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering.

495
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:14,651
We do not have all day.

496
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:55,860
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms.

497
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:58,318
You may refer to your books.

498
00:39:58,902 --> 00:40:00,943
Raise your hand
if you get the answer.

499
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:05,610
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last.

500
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:09,693
Your time starts... now.

501
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,235
Time up.

502
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,776
Time up, sir.

503
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,026
No one got the answer?

504
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,901
Now rewind your life by a minute.

505
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:57,943
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

506
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:00,860
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

507
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:04,068
Anyone?
... Sir?

508
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,818
No. You all got into a frantic race.

509
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:13,985
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

510
00:41:16,236 --> 00:41:19,610
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure.

511
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:22,068
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker.

512
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:27,818
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip.

513
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:32,401
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

514
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:33,443
Hello!

515
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:38,526
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

516
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:40,610
Sir, these words don't exist.

517
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:45,110
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

518
00:41:57,652 --> 00:41:58,568
Quiet!

519
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:02,901
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

520
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:05,276
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering.

521
00:42:05,861 --> 00:42:07,360
You're an expert at that.

522
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:11,443
I was teaching you... how to teach.

523
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:16,193
And I'm sure one day you'll learn.

524
00:42:17,194 --> 00:42:20,193
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students.

525
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:21,693
Bye, sir.

526
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:24,860
Quiet!

527
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:28,526
Quiet, I said.

528
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:35,360
I regret to inform you
that your son...

529
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,610
Farhan...
Raju...

530
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:37,943
has fallen into bad company.

531
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:41,443
Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined.

532
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,818
Virus's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs.

533
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:48,568
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom.

534
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:51,735
Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down.

535
00:42:52,777 --> 00:42:54,943
Come in.

536
00:42:57,486 --> 00:42:58,443
See that?

537
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:02,401
We could afford
just one air-conditioner.

538
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:07,818
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort.

539
00:43:09,277 --> 00:43:13,235
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter.

540
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:15,985
We put all our money
into Farhan's education.

541
00:43:17,486 --> 00:43:21,610
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. Understand?

542
00:43:30,236 --> 00:43:31,610
You took these pictures, Farhan?

543
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,526
He had that useless
obsession for a while.

544
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:38,151
Went around taking
pictures of animals.

545
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:41,026
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer.

546
00:43:42,236 --> 00:43:44,651
Son, what was your
score that year?

547
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:46,818
91%

548
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:51,818
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%.

549
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:56,401
You find it funny?

550
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:01,151
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

551
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,943
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

552
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:05,276
Enough!

553
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,818
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future.

554
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,693
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon.

555
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:22,901
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us.

556
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:27,276
Dad denied us a meal...

557
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:29,526
So, to fill our bellies with food...

558
00:44:29,902 --> 00:44:33,193
and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house.

559
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:39,235
Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film.

560
00:44:39,986 --> 00:44:40,985
A small, dingy room...

561
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:42,651
a paralyzed father...

562
00:44:43,444 --> 00:44:44,651
a coughing mother...

563
00:44:45,027 --> 00:44:46,526
and an unwed sister

564
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,026
A sofa sprouting springs...

565
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,776
a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof.

566
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:56,068
Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer.

567
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,901
Father was once a postmaster.

568
00:44:59,402 --> 00:45:01,818
Paralysis shut down
his body partly...

569
00:45:02,277 --> 00:45:04,693
his salary completely.
And the sister...

570
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:08,485
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry.

571
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:11,735
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

572
00:45:12,236 --> 00:45:13,151
Some okra?

573
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:18,026
Okra is now 12/- per kilo,
cauliflower is 10/-

574
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:19,776
It's daylight robbery!

575
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:24,151
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

576
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:25,318
Mom!

577
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:27,860
Cottage cheese?

578
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,860
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

579
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:33,943
- Cottage cheese?
- No, no, it's ok.

580
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:36,151
Mom, please.

581
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:38,818
Alright, I'll shut up

582
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:44,985
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid.

583
00:45:45,194 --> 00:45:47,485
and then take the vow of silence.

584
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:52,985
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes - his friends?

585
00:45:56,902 --> 00:45:57,985
Hey Raju.

586
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:02,568
We were in a huge dilemma.

587
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:06,318
Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?

588
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:10,485
Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese.

589
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:25,235
Even his eczema cream
costs 55/- now

590
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:31,318
Another roti?

591
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:34,610
No, thank you. We're through.

592
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:44,985
Okra for 12/-
- Cauliflower for 10/-

593
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:49,860
At least you were offered a meal

594
00:46:50,694 --> 00:46:53,568
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi!

595
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:56,401
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

596
00:46:56,652 --> 00:47:00,235
- Don't poke fun at my mom!
- Enough, you guys.

597
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:01,943
I'm famished. Let's eat out.

598
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,443
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

599
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:10,068
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

600
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:14,526
- C'mon.
- Come.

601
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,360
Good evening,
good evening.

602
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:19,318
Oh, Uncle.

603
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:27,860
- Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water.

604
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:29,318
If we're caught, we're dead.

605
00:47:29,486 --> 00:47:32,026
- What's for starters?
- Get double portions.

606
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:35,151
Leave this here and start
some peppy music.

607
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:37,568
Pia, what the hell?

608
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:40,651
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

609
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:45,443
What'll people say - My fiancee...

610
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,443
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200/- watch!

611
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:50,860
Please take it off. Thank you.

612
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:52,443
Hi handsome.

613
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,401
Hey Aunty.
You're looking good.

614
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:58,068
- Don't miss my set, darling.
- Rubies?

615
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:00,860
- From Mandalay
- Mandalay... Wow!

616
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,651
- Hey, let's go meet David.
- Of course.

617
00:48:06,986 --> 00:48:07,901
Excuse me.

618
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:11,235
Yes?

619
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:12,610
Flowers.

620
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:17,318
- May I take the glass?
- Why?

621
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:19,901
So you don't break it on my head

622
00:48:20,694 --> 00:48:21,943
Why would I do that?

623
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:24,485
For the free advice I'll now impart

624
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,526
What?

625
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:28,443
Don't marry that ass

626
00:48:29,527 --> 00:48:30,443
Excuse me?

627
00:48:30,652 --> 00:48:32,360
He's not a human,
he's a price tag.

628
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,776
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices.

629
00:48:36,402 --> 00:48:38,985
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished.

630
00:48:39,277 --> 00:48:40,151
Want a demonstration?

631
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,943
Shall I find out the price of his shoes?

632
00:48:45,486 --> 00:48:47,401
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself.

633
00:48:59,444 --> 00:49:05,401
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

634
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:08,735
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it.

635
00:49:09,277 --> 00:49:11,985
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched!

636
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:19,276
Dad, are they your guests?

637
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:25,901
My students.
What're they doing here?

638
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:31,068
Hold on, Dad.

639
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:34,860
These beans smell great.

640
00:49:34,986 --> 00:49:37,318
- No room for roti.
- Just pile it on.

641
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:40,651
- Hi.
- Hey.

642
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:45,193
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much.

643
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:48,985
It was my moral responsibility.

644
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:51,193
Can I ask you for little more help?

645
00:49:52,277 --> 00:49:54,901
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement.

646
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:59,860
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

647
00:50:00,152 --> 00:50:02,776
Certainly.
Raju, the mint sauce

648
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:04,776
You're really sweet

649
00:50:05,986 --> 00:50:09,068
- Where is your daddy?
- Right behind you.

650
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:16,026
Aal izz well

651
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:21,985
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

652
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:23,818
What're you doing here?

653
00:50:24,444 --> 00:50:27,568
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple.

654
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,901
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding.

655
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,485
Sister?

656
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,735
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

657
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:40,193
Empty. No gift cheques.

658
00:50:40,527 --> 00:50:42,610
Forgot the cheques, Raju
... Farhan?

659
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:46,860
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side.

660
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:51,318
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science.

661
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:53,651
How? Can you explain?

662
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:57,568
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo.

663
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:58,818
Won't you?

664
00:50:59,652 --> 00:51:03,235
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

665
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:05,818
disrupt wedding celebrations.

666
00:51:06,152 --> 00:51:08,276
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

667
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:10,818
draws power from guests' cars.

668
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,401
I see.

669
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,110
Wow!

670
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:15,901
So where's the inverter?

671
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:18,318
Sir, the design is ready.

672
00:51:21,402 --> 00:51:22,693
Where's the design, Farhan?

673
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:26,151
- I gave you the design.
- I gave it to Raju.

674
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:27,526
Raju, design?

675
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:34,360
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you.

676
00:51:34,694 --> 00:51:38,360
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter.

677
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:41,735
I'll make one, I promise.

678
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:45,568
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

679
00:51:45,986 --> 00:51:49,485
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

680
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:55,651
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow.

681
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:05,026
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you...

682
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:07,026
... in installments.

683
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:12,735
- We'll never crash a wedding again.
- Not even my own.

684
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:15,110
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he.

685
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:17,818
Uh... right. No marriage.

686
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:21,693
Your parents shouldn't have
married either.

687
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:25,901
The world would have
to feed two less idiots.

688
00:52:28,402 --> 00:52:29,443
Sit!

689
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:41,485
Pay attention.

690
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:57,360
This is Ranchoddas's father's
monthly income.

691
00:52:58,694 --> 00:53:05,026
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income.

692
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:13,901
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little.

693
00:53:15,152 --> 00:53:18,526
Isn't that your fathers income,
Farhan?

694
00:53:19,402 --> 00:53:21,110
Yes, sir.

695
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:24,526
Now take away another zero...

696
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:31,360
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi.

697
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:33,901
Big reason to worry.

698
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:45,776
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room.

699
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:50,443
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail.

700
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:14,776
- Want a shave?
- No, sir.

701
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:15,818
Then get lost!

702
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:32,651
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule.

703
00:54:32,777 --> 00:54:33,860
I have to worry.

704
00:54:34,277 --> 00:54:37,776
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job.

705
00:54:38,694 --> 00:54:41,735
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off.

706
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,735
Shut up, Raju.

707
00:54:43,986 --> 00:54:46,651
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'.

708
00:54:47,027 --> 00:54:48,485
I won't be his flunky... like you.

709
00:54:49,444 --> 00:54:51,735
- You're crossing the line.
- No, I'm drawing one.

710
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:53,943
I have a family to support.

711
00:54:56,152 --> 00:54:58,401
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension.

712
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:04,735
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry.

713
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:11,901
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years.

714
00:55:14,736 --> 00:55:17,943
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate.

715
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,068
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

716
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,401
Hey... no wisecracks about mom.

717
00:55:24,152 --> 00:55:28,401
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades.

718
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:33,401
To quote a Wise One - Study
to be accomplished, not affluent.

719
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:39,693
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down!

720
00:55:40,902 --> 00:55:43,526
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchoddas?

721
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:46,568
Go rot in the bogs!

722
00:55:48,194 --> 00:55:51,193
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible.

723
00:55:51,486 --> 00:55:52,651
Oh yeah?

724
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,443
Shove this back into the tube.

725
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:03,110
Raju got onto another train.

726
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:08,818
His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels

727
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,151
Chatur was called 'Silencer'.

728
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:19,193
To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack.

729
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:21,568
And then let off silent...
but lethal farts.

730
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:27,485
I didn't do it... Raju?

731
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:30,318
He always blamed others
for the output.

732
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:33,943
Silencer crammed 18 hours a day.

733
00:56:34,194 --> 00:56:37,318
On exam eve,
he would distract others.

734
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:44,360
His belief - There are only
two ways of topping.

735
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:47,985
Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades.

736
00:56:52,277 --> 00:56:56,151
Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...

737
00:56:56,611 --> 00:56:57,901
with one master plan.

738
00:56:59,944 --> 00:57:07,943
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

739
00:57:08,027 --> 00:57:12,068
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it.

740
00:57:13,486 --> 00:57:17,110
Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function.

741
00:57:17,444 --> 00:57:21,360
To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...

742
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:22,901
in highbrow Hindi.

743
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:29,818
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you.

744
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:32,610
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back.

745
00:57:35,402 --> 00:57:37,276
Oh... the things I have to do...

746
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:44,026
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you.

747
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:45,735
- Really?
- Yes. Just now.

748
00:57:46,111 --> 00:57:49,485
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur.

749
00:57:54,652 --> 00:57:57,693
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

750
00:57:57,819 --> 00:57:58,735
Yes?

751
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:01,693
I'm calling from the police station

752
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:04,901
- Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir.

753
00:58:06,444 --> 00:58:09,485
- Your life is in danger!
- What? ... How?

754
00:58:10,611 --> 00:58:12,401
Listen carefully, or else...

755
00:58:13,027 --> 00:58:17,360
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate.

756
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:19,360
Why? What happened?

757
00:58:19,486 --> 00:58:21,068
While Chatur was kept engaged,

758
00:58:21,486 --> 00:58:25,485
Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for eg...

759
00:58:25,694 --> 00:58:28,068
'served' became 'screwed'.

760
00:58:28,902 --> 00:58:30,193
Yes sir?

761
00:58:30,736 --> 00:58:33,276
- Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian.

762
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:37,026
I'm permanent staff, sir.

763
00:58:37,652 --> 00:58:39,068
Congratulations!

764
00:58:39,486 --> 00:58:42,860
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line.

765
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:44,193
Excuse me, sir...

766
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:56,110
Yes... so where was I?

767
00:58:56,361 --> 00:58:58,776
You said I may die...
outside the gate.

768
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:05,318
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal.

769
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:07,568
Traffic signal. Ok.

770
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:13,318
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt.

771
00:59:13,819 --> 00:59:15,151
Ok. Then?

772
00:59:15,277 --> 00:59:17,276
Then cross the road
with great caution.

773
00:59:18,027 --> 00:59:23,276
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead.

774
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,026
What nonsense! I know that.

775
00:59:27,152 --> 00:59:30,735
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy.

776
00:59:37,777 --> 00:59:39,860
From the librarian, Silencer.

777
00:59:39,986 --> 00:59:41,568
You don't call me that,
Chanchad.

778
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:49,485
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me.

779
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:52,526
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

780
00:59:52,694 --> 00:59:55,276
Remembered?
Rascals!

781
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:05,485
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson.

782
01:00:07,777 --> 01:00:12,068
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education....

783
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:16,651
respected teachers and friends.

784
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:23,110
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere.

785
01:00:23,736 --> 01:00:28,026
The credit goes solely to...

786
01:00:28,444 --> 01:00:32,235
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand.

787
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:36,401
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine.

788
01:00:37,152 --> 01:00:39,401
He's a great guy, really you are.

789
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:49,068
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students.

790
01:00:51,611 --> 01:00:53,985
He means - 'served' students.

791
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:56,818
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue.

792
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:04,526
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

793
01:01:04,736 --> 01:01:07,651
can screw so many, so well.

794
01:01:10,736 --> 01:01:16,026
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina.

795
01:01:19,736 --> 01:01:26,360
He's spent every living minute
just screwing.

796
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:30,693
Let's replicate his methods.

797
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:40,151
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe.

798
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:47,026
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw.

799
01:01:51,069 --> 01:01:54,276
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world.

800
01:01:59,861 --> 01:02:04,651
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

801
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:06,985
cannot be matched by any student...

802
01:02:07,236 --> 01:02:10,776
anywhere on the planet.

803
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:21,526
Mr. Minister. Good evening.

804
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:29,610
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs...

805
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:31,985
- Booty, funds.
- Bosom

806
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:37,735
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

807
01:02:39,152 --> 01:02:41,193
What nonsense! That's insulting.

808
01:02:41,652 --> 01:02:46,360
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed.

809
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:49,943
No one offers it so readily.

810
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:54,901
Vulgar fellow!

811
01:02:55,069 --> 01:02:56,693
You have generously offered
your bosom...

812
01:02:57,069 --> 01:03:00,151
to this relentless screwer.

813
01:03:03,111 --> 01:03:07,360
Now see how he makes it grow.

814
01:03:07,611 --> 01:03:11,860
Is this what you teach here, Director?

815
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:22,943
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

816
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:26,068
Listen to this - the might
of his fart in verse.

817
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:29,151
A good loud fart is honorable.

818
01:03:29,361 --> 01:03:31,735
'Fart'? Go, Silencer.

819
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:34,776
A medium fart is tolerable.

820
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:41,651
Softer windbreaks are terrible.

821
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:49,526
And the silent ones unbearable.

822
01:03:59,652 --> 01:04:02,610
That's what mindless cramming
does to you.

823
01:04:02,777 --> 01:04:06,276
Cramming may see you
through four years of college,

824
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:10,360
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years.

825
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:14,193
He still doesn't get it.

826
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,693
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable!

827
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,610
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

828
01:04:29,027 --> 01:04:32,443
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him.

829
01:04:34,944 --> 01:04:38,276
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

830
01:04:41,236 --> 01:04:43,276
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally.

831
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:44,776
I will.

832
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:48,235
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult.

833
01:04:48,861 --> 01:04:52,735
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life.

834
01:04:53,027 --> 01:04:58,401
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju - Don't cram blindly.

835
01:04:58,736 --> 01:05:00,943
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science.

836
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:03,568
I'm not here to enjoy Science.

837
01:05:03,694 --> 01:05:06,610
So You're here to screw Science?

838
01:05:08,277 --> 01:05:11,276
Go ahead.
Laugh at my methods.

839
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:16,693
But one day these methods
will bring me success.

840
01:05:17,152 --> 01:05:20,026
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry.

841
01:05:21,444 --> 01:05:25,693
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success.

842
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:28,776
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you.

843
01:05:28,986 --> 01:05:33,610
These ideals don't work
in the real world.

844
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:38,443
You take your train, l'll take mine.

845
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:42,526
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station.

846
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:48,360
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful.

847
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:51,068
You... or me.

848
01:05:51,819 --> 01:05:56,151
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

849
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:59,943
lt's a challenge.

850
01:06:01,236 --> 01:06:02,151
Watch it!

851
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:09,693
What's he writing?

852
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:19,610
Don't forget this date.

853
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:30,485
l'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas.

854
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:32,068
Get used to them, Pia.

855
01:06:32,194 --> 01:06:34,318
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife.

856
01:06:34,444 --> 01:06:35,568
Where's the bill, man?

857
01:06:40,027 --> 01:06:40,943
l'll be back.

858
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:52,985
- You changed the speech?
- What?

859
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:53,943
Don't lie.

860
01:06:54,652 --> 01:06:56,526
Um... Yeah.

861
01:06:56,736 --> 01:06:59,151
- What's your problem with dad?
- l have no problem.

862
01:06:59,611 --> 01:07:02,443
l'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh.

863
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:08,276
Why're you harassing him?

864
01:07:09,152 --> 01:07:10,568
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college.

865
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:14,526
Churning out asses.
Like that one.

866
01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:20,693
She destroyed it, man.

867
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:25,318
How dare you call him an ass?

868
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:28,818
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA...

869
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,735
then becomes a banker in the USA.

870
01:07:31,652 --> 01:07:34,151
Because it rakes in
more money?

871
01:07:34,402 --> 01:07:36,943
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement.

872
01:07:37,194 --> 01:07:39,193
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you.

873
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:43,193
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

874
01:07:43,486 --> 01:07:44,776
lt's not you he cares for.

875
01:07:47,027 --> 01:07:48,401
Who do you think you are?

876
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:50,318
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

877
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:54,235
New watch? One moment.

878
01:07:55,444 --> 01:07:57,526
You always need a demo.

879
01:07:58,569 --> 01:07:59,401
Hey Suhas!

880
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:03,151
Where were you?

881
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:05,235
She's looking for her watch.

882
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:07,193
What? You lost the watch?

883
01:08:07,444 --> 01:08:08,610
Never mind. Get another.

884
01:08:08,902 --> 01:08:10,193
lt cost 400,000!

885
01:08:12,236 --> 01:08:14,193
Mine's just 250/-
but keeps the same time.

886
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:16,693
Shut up! How could
you be so careless, Pia?

887
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:19,985
This callous attitude is
disgusting. lt's disrespectful!

888
01:08:20,111 --> 01:08:22,693
That was a limited edition watch.

889
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:26,526
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner.

890
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:29,276
What're you staring at?

891
01:08:32,236 --> 01:08:34,985
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia.

892
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:36,776
l can't handle this.

893
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:39,735
Stop crying and look for it.

894
01:08:53,236 --> 01:08:56,151
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass!

895
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:05,235
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face.

896
01:09:05,486 --> 01:09:06,360
Get lost!

897
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:08,318
lt's too noisy here.

898
01:09:08,652 --> 01:09:10,568
She's saying 'Thank you',
l hear 'Get lost'.

899
01:09:10,736 --> 01:09:13,568
- l said 'Get lost'.
- Don't get so uptight.

900
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:16,693
Actually, you never really loved him.

901
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:17,985
What do you mean?

902
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:23,151
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

903
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:26,318
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

904
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:29,068
The Moon appears gigantic?

905
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:32,151
That happens in movies, not in life.

906
01:09:32,277 --> 01:09:35,318
Happens in life too -
if you love a person...

907
01:09:35,652 --> 01:09:36,735
not an ass.

908
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:46,776
Hello. What?

909
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:51,360
Oh God! Ok, l'm on my way.

910
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:56,485
You're a medical student, right?
Need your help.

911
01:09:56,569 --> 01:09:58,276
- lt's an emergency, please.
- What?

912
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,985
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

913
01:10:02,194 --> 01:10:04,860
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath.

914
01:10:05,527 --> 01:10:07,360
Please help me,
it's an emergency.

915
01:10:11,861 --> 01:10:15,026
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

916
01:10:15,402 --> 01:10:17,776
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

917
01:10:18,277 --> 01:10:19,860
and here l am, helping you!

918
01:10:20,986 --> 01:10:22,193
Unbelievable!

919
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:27,235
This Hippocratic Oath -
lt's really done us in!

920
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:33,985
- Where's Raju, ma'am?
- Gone to get a cab.

921
01:10:34,361 --> 01:10:35,860
Called the ambulance
two hours ago.

922
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:38,735
ln this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes...

923
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:39,860
but an ambulance...

924
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,401
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently!

925
01:10:56,527 --> 01:10:57,568
Hey stop!

926
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:02,110
Move, it's an emergency!

927
01:11:03,736 --> 01:11:07,901
Move... move...

928
01:11:11,944 --> 01:11:14,110
Doctor, emergency!

929
01:11:15,694 --> 01:11:16,610
That's the patient.

930
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,651
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju.

931
01:11:25,152 --> 01:11:27,068
What the hell!
You brought dad on the scooter.

932
01:11:28,944 --> 01:11:30,276
Should l've sent him by courier?

933
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:33,485
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

934
01:11:34,069 --> 01:11:35,901
Go ask the doctor.

935
01:11:36,861 --> 01:11:40,110
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him.

936
01:11:40,486 --> 01:11:42,026
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter.

937
01:11:42,152 --> 01:11:44,943
Call me if there's a problem.

938
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:57,068
Rancho! Thank you...

939
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:01,860
Thanking your buddies!
Silencer teaching you manners?

940
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,151
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

941
01:12:07,944 --> 01:12:10,860
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow.

942
01:12:11,444 --> 01:12:14,693
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one!

943
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:18,651
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster.

944
01:12:19,277 --> 01:12:20,235
Don't worry!

945
01:12:27,277 --> 01:12:31,443
Rancho, forgive me.
l was scared.

946
01:12:31,694 --> 01:12:33,818
lt's ok. Quiet, now.

947
01:12:36,361 --> 01:12:38,526
Please forgive me.

948
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:49,151
lt's ok, calm down.
Go see your dad.

949
01:12:49,694 --> 01:12:51,068
And don't go
with that weepy face.

950
01:12:57,361 --> 01:12:58,360
Thanks buddy.

951
01:13:09,944 --> 01:13:14,735
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

952
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:17,360
Pour some mint sauce on it.
l'll tell you.

953
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:21,901
Hey, happy lndependence Day.

954
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:23,860
Today isn't lndependence Day.

955
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:27,360
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch.

956
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,735
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk.

957
01:13:33,027 --> 01:13:33,901
Hey.

958
01:13:35,861 --> 01:13:37,860
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

959
01:13:39,611 --> 01:13:42,068
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes.

960
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:44,068
Only the watch was old.

961
01:13:44,694 --> 01:13:45,610
What could that mean?

962
01:13:47,902 --> 01:13:51,068
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

963
01:13:53,902 --> 01:13:54,943
Yes.

964
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:57,735
Your mom must've been
really beautiful.

965
01:14:00,277 --> 01:14:02,443
Yes. How do you know?

966
01:14:02,694 --> 01:14:03,693
Seen your dad.

- Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What!

1013
01:18:38,236 --> 01:18:39,735
No, stupid.

1014
01:18:40,152 --> 01:18:42,485
lt's 8.30, your exam is at 9.

1015
01:18:43,152 --> 01:18:45,526
But we can't leave him alone.

1016
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:48,651
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours.

1017
01:18:48,736 --> 01:18:51,401
Take my scooter.
It's getting late.

1018
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:52,901
Hey...

1019
01:18:57,277 --> 01:18:58,651
Gosh, what an ancient watch.

1020
01:19:05,194 --> 01:19:06,151
Go.

1021
01:19:24,236 --> 01:19:26,651
- Sorry, we're late.
- It was an emergency.

1022
01:19:32,527 --> 01:19:33,651
Settle down there.

1023
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:39,443
Sir, they're still writing.

1024
01:19:40,861 --> 01:19:42,485
Hello. Time up.

1025
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:45,943
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late.

1026
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:47,318
It was an emergency.

1027
01:19:47,402 --> 01:19:51,693
He glared at us like we'd
asked for both his kidneys.

1028
01:19:52,902 --> 01:19:54,068
But we continued writing.

1029
01:19:55,027 --> 01:19:58,068
He continued arranging
the answer sheets.

1030
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:07,485
Done, sir.

1031
01:20:08,486 --> 01:20:11,110
You're late.
I can't accept these.

1032
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:12,193
Sir, please, sir.

1033
01:20:16,736 --> 01:20:18,068
Sir, do you know who we are?

1034
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:21,360
Prime Ministers son?
Even then...

1035
01:20:21,652 --> 01:20:23,735
I will not accept your paper.

1036
01:20:25,236 --> 01:20:27,235
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1037
01:20:28,527 --> 01:20:29,651
No...

1038
01:20:31,486 --> 01:20:32,526
Who are you?

1039
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:34,610
He doesn't know - Run!

1040
01:20:36,277 --> 01:20:38,568
Hey, what's your roll number?

1041
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:43,651
Where the hell are their papers?

1042
01:20:48,152 --> 01:20:49,985
O Lord, have mercy.

1043
01:20:50,069 --> 01:20:55,860
Today was Results day.
Time to make a deal with God.

1044
01:20:55,986 --> 01:20:58,485
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut.

1045
01:20:58,944 --> 01:21:03,860
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day.

1046
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:07,485
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass.

1047
01:21:07,736 --> 01:21:11,068
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1048
01:21:11,361 --> 01:21:12,818
Watch over my results.

1049
01:21:13,027 --> 01:21:16,901
God of Wealth, I'll offer 100/-
every month.

1050
01:21:17,111 --> 01:21:19,735
100/- won't bribe even a traffic cop,

1051
01:21:20,444 --> 01:21:22,276
let alone the Almighty.

1052
01:21:23,486 --> 01:21:25,568
Check from the bottom.

1053
01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:28,693
You are... last.

1054
01:21:30,402 --> 01:21:31,318
And you?

1055
01:21:33,361 --> 01:21:34,818
Second last.

1056
01:21:36,402 --> 01:21:37,485
Rancho?

1057
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:42,985
Not there.

1058
01:21:44,361 --> 01:21:45,401
My heart sank.

1059
01:21:45,986 --> 01:21:50,401
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked.

1060
01:21:52,861 --> 01:21:56,568
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice.

1061
01:22:00,694 --> 01:22:03,610
What's Silencer howling about?

1062
01:22:04,236 --> 01:22:05,193
He got the second rank.

1063
01:22:07,527 --> 01:22:08,568
Who's first?

1064
01:22:09,777 --> 01:22:10,901
Rancho.

1065
01:22:13,777 --> 01:22:14,651
Rancho?

1066
01:22:17,111 --> 01:22:17,943
Move aside.

1067
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:25,026
We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:

1068
01:22:25,819 --> 01:22:31,193
Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse.

1069
01:22:31,902 --> 01:22:36,318
We were sad.
Two others were sadder.

1070
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:41,443
Ranchoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director.

1071
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:44,360
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat.

1072
01:22:45,277 --> 01:22:48,526
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat.

1073
01:22:50,319 --> 01:22:52,985
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1074
01:22:53,152 --> 01:22:55,610
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1075
01:22:56,777 --> 01:22:58,026
Any problem with that?

1076
01:22:58,152 --> 01:23:02,276
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system.

1077
01:23:02,736 --> 01:23:05,901
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1078
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:09,485
- It's not nice, sir.
- You have a better idea?

1079
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:14,235
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all.

1080
01:23:14,694 --> 01:23:18,776
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1081
01:23:19,069 --> 01:23:24,110
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1082
01:23:24,236 --> 01:23:25,693
or air your report on TV?

1083
01:23:26,527 --> 01:23:27,610
You see, sir?

1084
01:23:28,194 --> 01:23:29,985
So basically, what you are saying is...

1085
01:23:30,486 --> 01:23:32,276
I should personally go to
each student's room

1086
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:34,401
and whisper in his ears...

1087
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:37,860
'You have come first',
'You're second".

1088
01:23:37,944 --> 01:23:39,526
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'.

1089
01:23:42,527 --> 01:23:46,901
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide.

1090
01:23:49,236 --> 01:23:51,193
I've topped, so I'm next to you.

1091
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:53,860
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner.

1092
01:23:54,027 --> 01:23:55,568
At least they're in the corner.

1093
01:23:55,694 --> 01:23:58,110
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo.

1094
01:23:59,236 --> 01:24:01,235
They will neither pass,
nor get a job.

1095
01:24:02,027 --> 01:24:05,901
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1096
01:24:06,361 --> 01:24:08,193
prefers humans to machines.

1097
01:24:10,069 --> 01:24:11,901
They'll get jobs. I guarantee.

1098
01:24:13,902 --> 01:24:16,235
You guarantee it!

1099
01:24:16,444 --> 01:24:17,985
Bet, sir?

1100
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:22,693
- Govind.
- Yes, sir?

1101
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:30,151
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1102
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:32,568
shave off my moustache.

1103
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,193
Sir!

1104
01:24:36,486 --> 01:24:39,526
- Happy?
- Smile, please.

1105
01:24:40,819 --> 01:24:41,776
Happy, sir.

1106
01:24:46,152 --> 01:24:49,735
Jackass!
Honking to hide your tooting.

1107
01:24:50,277 --> 01:24:52,985
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1108
01:24:53,236 --> 01:24:55,901
I didn't do it... Raju?

1109
01:24:56,111 --> 01:24:57,735
This is a familiar stink.

1110
01:24:57,819 --> 01:25:00,860
He's the sole cause for global warming.

1111
01:25:26,111 --> 01:25:28,735
Toss me your wallet - I'll buy pants.

1112
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:33,485
- Take Chatur's suit instead.
- Don't touch my suit.

1113
01:25:34,652 --> 01:25:36,443
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear.

1114
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:40,610
- Where's this?
- If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1115
01:25:40,819 --> 01:25:43,401
- He can't read.
- But he can speak.

1116
01:25:43,611 --> 01:25:47,610
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchoddas Chanchad?

1117
01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:49,568
Yes, he lives there.

1118
01:25:50,236 --> 01:25:55,568
♪ Free as the wind was he ♪

1119
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:02,985
♪ Like a soaring kite was he ♪

1120
01:26:04,652 --> 01:26:06,943
♪ Where did he go... ♪

1121
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:09,401
♪ let's find him ♪

1122
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:12,193
- Chatur, your pills.
- Thanks. Where were they?

1123
01:26:12,236 --> 01:26:14,776
- In the pocket.
- Hey, my pants!

1124
01:26:14,902 --> 01:26:16,901
Karl Marx says to share all resources.

1125
01:26:18,486 --> 01:26:20,443
Hey, you'll give people ideas.

1126
01:26:21,986 --> 01:26:23,026
I want it now!

1127
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:39,401
What happened?

1128
01:26:41,527 --> 01:26:42,735
Rancho's father.

1129
01:26:46,236 --> 01:26:48,985
Excuse me, where is Ranchoddas?

1130
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:52,235
- There he is.
- Thank you.

1131
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:18,568
- Rancho...
- Yes?

1132
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:22,860
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchoddas.

1133
01:27:23,861 --> 01:27:25,193
I am Ranchoddas.

1134
01:27:25,777 --> 01:27:29,693
No, I mean...
'Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad'.

1135
01:27:31,111 --> 01:27:33,693
Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad.
That's me.

1136
01:27:39,152 --> 01:27:41,443
Ranchoddas, take care, son.

1137
01:28:00,736 --> 01:28:02,860
'Ranchoddas Chanchad'

1138
01:28:10,027 --> 01:28:11,068
Raju

1139
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:39,943
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear.

1140
01:28:40,069 --> 01:28:41,193
That too, for the wrong guy!

1141
01:28:41,694 --> 01:28:45,651
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy.

1142
01:28:46,236 --> 01:28:47,693
What's going on?

1143
01:28:48,402 --> 01:28:51,068
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1144
01:28:52,236 --> 01:28:53,110
Good point!

1145
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:55,943
Hey Chatur, come here.

1146
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:05,735
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco.

1147
01:29:05,777 --> 01:29:07,318
Handmade biscuits.

1148
01:29:09,152 --> 01:29:11,401
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu.

1149
01:29:11,652 --> 01:29:13,818
Phunsukh Bangdu?
Who's that?

1150
01:29:13,902 --> 01:29:18,526
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu.

1151
01:29:18,611 --> 01:29:21,443
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist.

1152
01:29:21,527 --> 01:29:24,235
400 patents.
The world wants him.

1153
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:28,735
Took me a year to get an appointment.

1154
01:29:29,486 --> 01:29:34,943
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1155
01:29:35,027 --> 01:29:39,193
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1156
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:41,276
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu.

1157
01:29:41,652 --> 01:29:45,235
He led me to Rancho, see this.

1158
01:29:47,402 --> 01:29:51,860
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu.

1159
01:29:51,944 --> 01:29:56,276
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho.

1160
01:29:56,402 --> 01:30:02,026
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name.

1161
01:30:02,069 --> 01:30:03,735
What happened to his face?

1162
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:06,443
Plastic surgery in honor of your visit?

1163
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:12,651
Only one man has the answer.

1164
01:30:13,236 --> 01:30:17,901
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish.

1165
01:30:19,361 --> 01:30:23,151
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage.

1166
01:30:24,069 --> 01:30:26,568
But I waited
for the highway tender.

1167
01:30:28,069 --> 01:30:32,526
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes.

1168
01:30:36,611 --> 01:30:41,110
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1169
01:30:41,277 --> 01:30:42,610
Wrong.

1170
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:45,901
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1171
01:30:46,194 --> 01:30:47,485
You were a very good son.

1172
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:54,860
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested.

1173
01:30:55,027 --> 01:30:58,235
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries.

1174
01:30:58,527 --> 01:31:01,610
You use the degree
to clinch contracts.

1175
01:31:02,069 --> 01:31:05,318
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1176
01:31:20,902 --> 01:31:22,318
This is a 150 acre estate.

1177
01:31:22,736 --> 01:31:25,943
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice.

1178
01:31:26,277 --> 01:31:27,193
Get the point?

1179
01:31:28,527 --> 01:31:29,401
Now get lost!

1180
01:31:34,986 --> 01:31:39,276
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too.

1181
01:31:46,736 --> 01:31:48,318
Grab Papa!

1182
01:31:51,236 --> 01:31:52,360
Here, here.

1183
01:31:56,486 --> 01:31:57,526
Let go of Papa!

1184
01:32:00,444 --> 01:32:03,276
Tell the truth or Papa is flushed!

1185
01:32:03,402 --> 01:32:06,318
- Hand over Papa!
- Papa goes to the sacred sewer.

1186
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:10,360
- Get Papa out of the potty.
- You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1187
01:32:10,486 --> 01:32:11,818
I'll count to three.

1188
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:15,610
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes.

1189
01:32:18,277 --> 01:32:19,276
One.

1190
01:32:19,444 --> 01:32:24,193
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain.

1191
01:32:25,444 --> 01:32:26,360
Two.

1192
01:32:26,444 --> 01:32:28,901
Then grope for him in the gutter.

1193
01:32:29,027 --> 01:32:29,901
What is it, Raju?

1194
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:33,818
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1195
01:32:34,694 --> 01:32:35,610
Empty?

1196
01:32:36,986 --> 01:32:40,443
Empty - we'll empty it out!

1197
01:32:40,569 --> 01:32:41,443
No, no!

1198
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:44,401
We'll empty it out!

1199
01:32:44,486 --> 01:32:46,943
No... hands up!

1200
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:52,276
Who are you?

1201
01:32:52,444 --> 01:32:53,568
I am Rancho.

1202
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:57,318
I swear on Papa, it's true.

1203
01:32:57,527 --> 01:32:59,318
I am Rancho!
That was Chhote.

1204
01:33:00,444 --> 01:33:01,276
Chhote?

1205
01:33:02,652 --> 01:33:07,651
He was our gardener's son, Chhote.

1206
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:12,443
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned.

1207
01:33:14,652 --> 01:33:22,485
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands.

1208
01:33:23,902 --> 01:33:25,193
He had a passion for learning.

1209
01:33:28,444 --> 01:33:31,110
He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school.

1210
01:33:33,111 --> 01:33:36,068
And attend any class he liked.
It suited me.

1211
01:33:37,027 --> 01:33:43,110
I made him do my homework,
take my exams.

1212
01:33:43,611 --> 01:33:46,651
It was going well, till
one day...

1213
01:33:47,069 --> 01:33:51,651
Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math.

1214
01:33:51,694 --> 01:33:53,235
Which grade are you in, son?

1215
01:33:54,444 --> 01:33:55,651
What's your name?

1216
01:33:56,611 --> 01:33:57,568
We got caught.

1217
01:33:58,736 --> 01:34:00,110
Papa was a powerful man, so...

1218
01:34:00,236 --> 01:34:03,735
our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal.

1219
01:34:04,236 --> 01:34:08,193
You started it, you will finish it.

1220
01:34:10,902 --> 01:34:13,693
People pretend to show me respect...

1221
01:34:14,402 --> 01:34:16,610
But behind my back...

1222
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,193
mock me as an illiterate.

1223
01:34:20,194 --> 01:34:22,235
I won't let that happen to my son.

1224
01:34:23,319 --> 01:34:27,651
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree.

1225
01:34:28,194 --> 01:34:30,151
Let the game go on.

1226
01:34:31,152 --> 01:34:32,776
Make this kid an engineer,

1227
01:34:34,027 --> 01:34:39,401
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall.

1228
01:34:39,736 --> 01:34:43,735
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me.

1229
01:34:45,402 --> 01:34:51,568
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree.

1230
01:34:53,694 --> 01:35:01,943
But he always said:
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1231
01:35:06,902 --> 01:35:08,568
He really misses you both.

1232
01:35:10,986 --> 01:35:14,943
I'll give you his address,
go to him.

1233
01:35:18,277 --> 01:35:21,776
But please keep my secret.

1234
01:35:23,652 --> 01:35:24,818
What secret?

1235
01:35:38,152 --> 01:35:41,651
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here.

1236
01:35:43,861 --> 01:35:46,443
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1237
01:35:46,486 --> 01:35:50,026
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you.

1238
01:35:50,069 --> 01:35:52,360
- Ignore it.
- Where're we going?

1239
01:35:53,694 --> 01:35:54,610
Ladakh.

1240
01:35:54,652 --> 01:35:56,026
Ladakh! Why?

1241
01:35:56,736 --> 01:35:57,693
To meet Rancho.

1242
01:35:57,861 --> 01:36:00,860
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1243
01:36:00,902 --> 01:36:04,485
No clue. We have
the address of a school.

1244
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:07,818
School teacher!

1245
01:36:08,694 --> 01:36:12,110
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1246
01:36:12,527 --> 01:36:14,818
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1247
01:36:14,986 --> 01:36:16,193
D for Donkey.

1248
01:36:16,902 --> 01:36:21,860
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu.

1249
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:25,068
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1250
01:36:28,777 --> 01:36:31,193
Today my respect
for that idiot shot up.

1251
01:36:32,111 --> 01:36:34,443
Most of us went to college
just for a degree.

1252
01:36:35,027 --> 01:36:39,235
No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...

1253
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:42,110
no credit card, no social status.

1254
01:36:42,777 --> 01:36:44,610
None of this mattered to him.

1255
01:36:44,736 --> 01:36:46,568
He was in college
for the joy of learning.

1256
01:36:47,069 --> 01:36:50,360
He never cared
if he was first or last.

1257
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,276
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1258
01:36:53,527 --> 01:36:54,776
Neil Armstrong, sir.

1259
01:36:54,819 --> 01:36:56,985
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it.

1260
01:36:57,152 --> 01:36:58,401
Who was the second?

1261
01:36:58,902 --> 01:37:00,526
Don't waste your time.
It's not important.

1262
01:37:00,986 --> 01:37:03,485
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second.

1263
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:10,068
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers.

1264
01:37:10,527 --> 01:37:16,193
You'll have a job
even before your final exam.

1265
01:37:16,944 --> 01:37:18,818
This is your last lap, my friends.

1266
01:37:19,152 --> 01:37:21,360
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas.

1267
01:37:21,444 --> 01:37:23,443
Go out there and make history!

1268
01:37:26,861 --> 01:37:28,110
Any questions?

1269
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:31,526
Yes?

1270
01:37:32,861 --> 01:37:36,485
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1271
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:44,151
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1272
01:37:44,652 --> 01:37:45,985
Very good question.

1273
01:37:49,236 --> 01:37:51,610
Anyone else
with the same question?

1274
01:37:53,527 --> 01:37:54,860
As expected.

1275
01:37:57,194 --> 01:38:00,318
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand.

1276
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:13,776
For the last four years...

1277
01:38:13,819 --> 01:38:16,776
they've been our most
consistent students.

1278
01:38:16,902 --> 01:38:20,235
Consistently last in every exam.

1279
01:38:21,069 --> 01:38:22,443
Come my geniuses, come.

1280
01:38:23,902 --> 01:38:29,526
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price.

1281
01:38:30,236 --> 01:38:33,276
'Cause they're completely unused.

1282
01:38:35,777 --> 01:38:37,026
And to answer their question:

1283
01:38:37,402 --> 01:38:40,735
The exam won't affect their jobs.

1284
01:38:41,527 --> 01:38:45,068
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1285
01:38:45,902 --> 01:38:48,943
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1286
01:38:49,236 --> 01:38:52,151
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1287
01:38:52,236 --> 01:38:53,735
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody.

1288
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:07,693
He screwed us!

1289
01:39:07,819 --> 01:39:09,776
In front of everyone.

1290
01:39:10,902 --> 01:39:16,026
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks.

1291
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:17,901
Do me just one favor.

1292
01:39:17,986 --> 01:39:20,443
Delete Virus!

1293
01:39:22,069 --> 01:39:24,068
Burn him in hell.

1294
01:39:25,444 --> 01:39:29,276
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil.

1295
01:39:30,027 --> 01:39:32,901
You think God is a contract killer?

1296
01:39:33,527 --> 01:39:34,818
You shut up!

1297
01:39:35,527 --> 01:39:38,443
You're in the center
of the photo every year.

1298
01:39:38,486 --> 01:39:40,443
We're rotting in the corner.

1299
01:39:41,486 --> 01:39:44,526
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether.

1300
01:39:46,986 --> 01:39:48,818
- Know why I come first?
- Why?

1301
01:39:49,236 --> 01:39:50,943
Because I love machines.

1302
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,568
Engineering is my passion.

1303
01:39:54,611 --> 01:39:55,860
Know your passion?

1304
01:39:58,694 --> 01:40:00,401
- That's my bag.
- Be quiet.

1305
01:40:01,361 --> 01:40:02,693
What're you up to?

1306
01:40:05,111 --> 01:40:07,276
This... is your passion.

1307
01:40:08,527 --> 01:40:09,943
Go post this letter.

1308
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:11,651
What letter?

1309
01:40:14,361 --> 01:40:18,651
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1310
01:40:19,402 --> 01:40:22,193
- Andre...
- Istvan.

1311
01:40:23,152 --> 01:40:26,776
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary.

1312
01:40:27,694 --> 01:40:31,026
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it.

1313
01:40:32,736 --> 01:40:36,318
Quit Engineering, marry Photography.

1314
01:40:37,277 --> 01:40:39,276
Follow your talent.

1315
01:40:42,402 --> 01:40:46,443
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1316
01:40:47,236 --> 01:40:50,776
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1317
01:40:51,486 --> 01:40:52,818
imagine the disaster.

1318
01:40:54,861 --> 01:40:57,401
Do you get it?

1319
01:41:00,944 --> 01:41:04,276
Idiot! Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines.

1320
01:41:08,902 --> 01:41:10,318
Your Holiness Guru Ranchoddas!

1321
01:41:11,611 --> 01:41:15,776
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both.

1322
01:41:17,194 --> 01:41:19,735
- But I still fail. Why?
- Explain.

1323
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:23,235
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future.

1324
01:41:24,944 --> 01:41:29,443
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers.

1325
01:41:29,986 --> 01:41:33,193
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job.

1326
01:41:34,652 --> 01:41:38,443
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1327
01:41:39,277 --> 01:41:40,943
How'll you focus on studies?

1328
01:41:42,277 --> 01:41:45,401
Strange buddies! One lives
in fear, the other in pretense.

1329
01:41:46,361 --> 01:41:51,735
You live in both - fear and pretense.

1330
01:41:51,944 --> 01:41:58,026
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't.

1331
01:42:00,527 --> 01:42:02,610
What rubbish!

1332
01:42:03,236 --> 01:42:07,318
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it.

1333
01:42:07,402 --> 01:42:10,651
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1334
01:42:11,111 --> 01:42:14,985
- There's no connection!
- Deep connection, Your Holiness.

1335
01:42:15,069 --> 01:42:20,568
Listen, if you confess to Pia...

1336
01:42:20,986 --> 01:42:25,443
I'll tell Dad - No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1337
01:42:26,611 --> 01:42:30,276
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview.

1338
01:42:30,694 --> 01:42:31,776
Deal?

1339
01:42:33,861 --> 01:42:35,651
Have the guts?

1340
01:42:35,777 --> 01:42:38,068
His Holiness is speechless.

1341
01:42:44,111 --> 01:42:44,985
Let's go.

1342
01:42:50,027 --> 01:42:51,360
- Follow me.
- Where?

1343
01:42:56,986 --> 01:42:58,526
Let's go.

1344
01:42:58,944 --> 01:43:02,068
Hey Virus! I'm anti-Virus.

1345
01:43:02,152 --> 01:43:03,651
Hope no dog here.

1346
01:43:03,777 --> 01:43:06,193
Cowards! Let's go.

1347
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:10,026
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert.

1348
01:43:22,277 --> 01:43:23,860
Beware - Virus inside.

1349
01:43:44,444 --> 01:43:45,651
Need background score?

1350
01:43:45,861 --> 01:43:46,860
- Pia.
- Who's it?

1351
01:43:49,611 --> 01:43:53,318
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho.

1352
01:43:55,236 --> 01:43:58,651
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone.

1353
01:43:58,944 --> 01:44:01,360
Say not a word...

1354
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:02,693
- Pia...
- Yes?

1355
01:44:04,819 --> 01:44:08,151
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1356
01:44:08,986 --> 01:44:13,568
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life.

1357
01:44:17,986 --> 01:44:23,401
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter.

1358
01:44:23,527 --> 01:44:24,401
Wow!

1359
01:44:25,652 --> 01:44:28,776
... and time stands still.

1360
01:44:29,819 --> 01:44:37,276
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride.

1361
01:44:40,236 --> 01:44:42,568
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet...

1362
01:44:46,027 --> 01:44:48,985
and come close to kiss me.

1363
01:44:52,069 --> 01:44:54,360
But that kiss doesn't happen.

1364
01:44:55,194 --> 01:44:56,110
Why?

1365
01:44:56,444 --> 01:44:59,610
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up.

1366
01:45:00,694 --> 01:45:02,360
The noses never collide, stupid!

1367
01:45:07,486 --> 01:45:10,568
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia.

1368
01:45:11,152 --> 01:45:12,110
I wish I was.

1369
01:45:12,402 --> 01:45:14,193
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1370
01:45:14,652 --> 01:45:16,485
It took him four years to say this.

1371
01:45:16,694 --> 01:45:19,735
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide.

1372
01:45:19,819 --> 01:45:23,068
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1373
01:45:23,611 --> 01:45:25,276
- Who's this?
- My sister.

1374
01:45:26,277 --> 01:45:27,318
Who're you?

1375
01:45:36,986 --> 01:45:40,735
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time!

1376
01:45:40,777 --> 01:45:44,610
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1377
01:45:44,902 --> 01:45:48,943
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor.

1378
01:45:49,902 --> 01:45:50,818
Meaning?

1379
01:45:50,986 --> 01:45:53,860
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor.

1380
01:45:54,652 --> 01:46:00,151
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus.

1381
01:46:01,236 --> 01:46:04,985
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1382
01:46:05,111 --> 01:46:10,526
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer.

1383
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:16,610
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1384
01:46:17,402 --> 01:46:20,776
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1385
01:46:21,652 --> 01:46:22,485
He kicked.

1386
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:25,526
Say it again.

1387
01:46:26,736 --> 01:46:28,360
All is well.

1388
01:46:29,236 --> 01:46:30,943
Kicked again.

1389
01:46:32,569 --> 01:46:35,568
- Once more.
- All is well.

1390
01:46:40,069 --> 01:46:44,235
All is well.

1391
01:46:44,777 --> 01:46:45,776
Who is it?

1392
01:46:46,611 --> 01:46:47,610
Go.

1393
01:46:48,277 --> 01:46:53,318
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you.

1394
01:46:53,402 --> 01:46:57,860
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1395
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:07,068
- Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law.

1396
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:08,818
And the wedding party.

1397
01:47:09,652 --> 01:47:10,735
Rastogi!

1398
01:47:13,152 --> 01:47:14,985
Security, that way.

1399
01:47:44,569 --> 01:47:48,318
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum.

1400
01:47:49,027 --> 01:47:52,943
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum.

1401
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:58,360
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis.

1402
01:47:58,777 --> 01:47:59,860
Let me demonstrate to you

1403
01:48:00,444 --> 01:48:02,401
- What's this?
- Pencil.

1404
01:48:02,694 --> 01:48:04,151
- What's inside?
- Lead.

1405
01:48:04,194 --> 01:48:06,360
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil.

1406
01:48:06,861 --> 01:48:09,860
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1407
01:48:17,486 --> 01:48:20,110
- Where is Raju Rastogi?
- Present, sir.

1408
01:48:27,569 --> 01:48:29,485
Hi. Everybody is here.

1409
01:48:31,152 --> 01:48:32,235
Good morning, sir.

1410
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,360
Where were you last night?

1411
01:48:34,902 --> 01:48:37,985
- Studying all night, sir.
- Studying?

1412
01:48:38,152 --> 01:48:39,110
Really?

1413
01:48:39,236 --> 01:48:42,235
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy.

1414
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:43,235
Not slept?

1415
01:48:43,402 --> 01:48:44,443
What did you study?

1416
01:48:45,527 --> 01:48:49,568
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter.

1417
01:48:49,861 --> 01:48:50,776
Whole chapter?

1418
01:48:50,986 --> 01:48:53,026
In that case, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1419
01:48:53,111 --> 01:48:54,026
Yessir!

1420
01:48:54,152 --> 01:48:56,818
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1421
01:49:04,902 --> 01:49:05,818
Stop it!

1422
01:49:13,486 --> 01:49:15,776
Sir, rum.

1423
01:49:17,652 --> 01:49:18,693
Mr. Rastogi!

1424
01:49:19,152 --> 01:49:21,526
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office.

1425
01:49:27,611 --> 01:49:28,568
Sir?

1426
01:49:29,736 --> 01:49:30,651
Close the door.

1427
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:36,985
Can you type?

1428
01:49:38,277 --> 01:49:39,151
Yes, sir.

1429
01:49:39,361 --> 01:49:40,818
Will you type a letter for me?

1430
01:49:42,902 --> 01:49:43,985
Definitely, sir.

1431
01:49:44,277 --> 01:49:45,235
Come, sit.

1432
01:49:45,986 --> 01:49:47,026
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1433
01:49:49,402 --> 01:49:50,360
Please type.

1434
01:49:52,027 --> 01:49:52,860
Dear Sir...

1435
01:49:53,819 --> 01:49:57,235
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1436
01:49:58,527 --> 01:50:01,235
that your son is rusticated...

1437
01:50:01,986 --> 01:50:04,568
No, sorry, delete that.
Go back.

1438
01:50:05,277 --> 01:50:09,360
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1439
01:50:10,444 --> 01:50:14,610
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering.

1440
01:50:15,194 --> 01:50:16,610
Come on, type.

1441
01:50:24,069 --> 01:50:25,776
It'll kill my dad, sir.

1442
01:50:25,944 --> 01:50:27,735
- Please type.
- Sir, please sir.

1443
01:50:28,194 --> 01:50:32,151
My decision is final and irrevocable.

1444
01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:39,360
He lives just to see me
become an engineer.

1445
01:50:39,402 --> 01:50:43,693
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door.

1446
01:50:43,819 --> 01:50:48,276
Sir, give me one chance... please.

1447
01:50:53,861 --> 01:50:57,276
Ok, remove your name
from the letter...

1448
01:50:58,611 --> 01:51:00,776
and put in Rancho's.

1449
01:51:02,194 --> 01:51:04,401
I know he was with you
last night.

1450
01:51:05,236 --> 01:51:09,318
Be my witness and
I'll spare you.

1451
01:51:12,861 --> 01:51:16,901

Raju.

1464
01:53:05,277 --> 01:53:08,443
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert.

1465
01:53:08,944 --> 01:53:13,276
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him.

Your dad's recovered.

1468
01:53:25,402 --> 01:53:26,776
The new medicine worked.

1469
01:53:27,194 --> 01:53:30,026

Your dad wants Pia's scooter.

Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it.

1474
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:52,443
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel.

1475
01:53:54,694 --> 01:53:57,526
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order.

01:56:00,819 --> 01:56:03,526
She's getting married.

1504
01:56:04,527 --> 01:56:05,860
Without any dowry.

1505
01:56:06,527 --> 01:56:11,443
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all.

1506
01:56:11,652 --> 01:56:15,151
He just wants Kammo.

1507
01:56:15,777 --> 01:56:19,943
- You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yeah.

1508
01:56:19,986 --> 01:56:20,860
Guess!

1509
01:56:20,902 --> 01:56:22,818
- You know him very well.
- Yes.

1510
01:56:22,986 --> 01:56:24,651
- He loves animals.
- Huh...?

1511
01:56:25,444 --> 01:56:27,485
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer.

1512
01:56:27,569 --> 01:56:29,151
Quiet... Shhhh...

1513
01:56:29,236 --> 01:56:32,401
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan.

1514
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:37,485
Farhan will never take any dowry.

1515
01:56:38,111 --> 01:56:42,485
Farhan will marry your sister.

1517
01:56:48,111 --> 01:56:50,235
Raju!

1518
01:56:57,194 --> 01:57:00,985
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him.

1519
01:57:01,361 --> 01:57:03,110
Why sacrifice me...!

1520
01:57:03,361 --> 01:57:05,360
Well done, buddy.

01:57:06,152 --> 01:57:09,693

You coming with me?

1536
01:58:13,652 --> 01:58:18,276
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home.

1537
01:58:18,402 --> 01:58:19,776
Why would I go home?

1538
01:58:21,277 --> 01:58:24,735
Remember, we promised
this rascal.

1539
01:58:28,069 --> 01:58:30,151
Give me your tie.

1540
01:58:31,694 --> 01:58:32,568
Why?

1541
01:58:32,777 --> 01:58:36,693
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this.

1542
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:38,526
What's that?

1543
01:58:38,694 --> 01:58:41,568
- A letter...
- For you, from Hungary.

1544
01:58:41,902 --> 01:58:44,526
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan.

1545
01:58:52,444 --> 01:58:54,235
You posted my letter!

1546
01:58:54,402 --> 01:58:56,110
He loved your pictures.

1547
01:58:56,569 --> 01:58:59,235
The guy wants you to assist him...

1548
01:59:00,027 --> 01:59:03,568
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year.

1549
01:59:03,944 --> 01:59:05,526
Will pay you, too.

1550
01:59:21,444 --> 01:59:22,735
Dad will never agree.

1551
01:59:25,319 --> 01:59:27,985
Go speak to him...
from your heart.

1552
01:59:29,652 --> 01:59:30,818
For once, dump your fears...

1553
01:59:31,486 --> 01:59:37,526
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it.

1554
01:59:38,027 --> 01:59:40,610
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1555
01:59:40,736 --> 01:59:44,526
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around.

1556
01:59:51,069 --> 01:59:53,026
Do you think he'll like it?

1557
01:59:53,652 --> 01:59:55,985
Why such an expensive gift?

1558
01:59:57,111 --> 01:59:59,568
Our son's getting
his first job today.

1559
02:00:00,861 --> 02:00:04,776
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment.

1560
02:00:06,694 --> 02:00:07,693
Farhan?

1561
02:00:12,777 --> 02:00:15,068
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1562
02:00:16,861 --> 02:00:17,735
I didn't go.

1563
02:00:20,486 --> 02:00:22,235
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad.

1564
02:00:26,444 --> 02:00:28,401
What happened?
You had an accident?

1565
02:00:32,027 --> 02:00:37,276
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor.

1566
02:00:40,069 --> 02:00:40,985
Why?

1567
02:00:41,319 --> 02:00:43,651
Because I was rusticated
from college.

1568
02:00:46,569 --> 02:00:47,401
Why?

1569
02:00:47,902 --> 02:00:52,735
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door.

1570
02:00:55,027 --> 02:00:58,693
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1571
02:00:58,819 --> 02:01:02,568
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer.

1572
02:01:04,694 --> 02:01:09,318
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession.

1573
02:01:09,652 --> 02:01:11,235
Then work will become play.

1574
02:01:11,361 --> 02:01:13,276
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1575
02:01:13,902 --> 02:01:17,568
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot.

1576
02:01:17,611 --> 02:01:18,818
Five years from now...

1577
02:01:19,527 --> 02:01:24,276
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself.

1578
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:28,360
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you.

1579
02:01:30,402 --> 02:01:32,193
I'd rather curse myself, Dad.

1580
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:33,526
The world will laugh!

1581
02:01:34,777 --> 02:01:36,776
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year.

1582
02:01:37,652 --> 02:01:43,360
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1583
02:01:43,611 --> 02:01:45,776
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner.

1584
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:50,860
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well.

1585
02:01:53,194 --> 02:01:56,193
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders.

1586
02:01:59,027 --> 02:02:00,276
You did all that, Dad.

1587
02:02:02,736 --> 02:02:08,193
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference.

1588
02:02:09,361 --> 02:02:11,235
I don't even know his first name.

1589
02:02:11,361 --> 02:02:14,276
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1590
02:02:14,444 --> 02:02:17,193
Enough, please... he's upset.

1591
02:02:18,444 --> 02:02:20,901
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1592
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:22,693
Then the discussion is over.

1593
02:02:22,986 --> 02:02:26,776
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof.

1594
02:02:30,236 --> 02:02:35,235
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise.

1595
02:02:37,736 --> 02:02:44,735
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet.

1596
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:50,151
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1597
02:02:50,277 --> 02:02:53,568
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1598
02:02:53,611 --> 02:02:55,401
when you see my dead body.

1599
02:03:00,694 --> 02:03:04,735
I want to convince you, Dad...

1600
02:03:06,194 --> 02:03:08,651
but not with a suicide threat.

1601
02:03:12,402 --> 02:03:16,235
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1602
02:03:16,527 --> 02:03:17,776
I'll earn less.

1603
02:03:18,694 --> 02:03:20,401
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car.

1604
02:03:22,444 --> 02:03:23,985
But I'll be happy.

1605
02:03:25,652 --> 02:03:26,943
I will be really happy.

1606
02:03:28,236 --> 02:03:29,901
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love.

1607
02:03:31,819 --> 02:03:33,568
I've always listened to you.

1608
02:03:33,944 --> 02:03:37,068
For once,
let me listen to my heart.

1609
02:03:39,152 --> 02:03:40,068
Please... Dad.

1610
02:03:46,486 --> 02:03:47,443
Dad...

1611
02:03:48,652 --> 02:03:49,901
Please don't go away...

1612
02:03:56,111 --> 02:03:57,318
Return this.

1613
02:04:00,819 --> 02:04:03,276
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1614
02:04:04,527 --> 02:04:06,318
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1615
02:04:07,777 --> 02:04:09,651
If you need more money, just ask.

1616
02:04:18,444 --> 02:04:20,401
Go live your life, my son.

1617
02:04:23,319 --> 02:04:27,610
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1618
02:04:28,277 --> 02:04:29,151
Fear.

1619
02:04:30,236 --> 02:04:31,651
I was a good student
since childhood...

1620
02:04:32,402 --> 02:04:34,568
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty.

1621
02:04:36,486 --> 02:04:37,485
That scared me.

1622
02:04:38,986 --> 02:04:42,485
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first.

1623
02:04:44,194 --> 02:04:45,235
My fear grew.

1624
02:04:46,902 --> 02:04:48,360
Fear is not good for grades, sir.

1625
02:04:48,986 --> 02:04:51,401
I slipped on more
charms and rings.

1626
02:04:52,402 --> 02:04:56,860
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors.

1627
02:04:59,944 --> 02:05:03,068
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect.

1628
02:05:03,611 --> 02:05:04,860
Finally, sense dawned.

1629
02:05:06,361 --> 02:05:11,526
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life.

1630
02:05:13,986 --> 02:05:17,985
If you reject me, no regrets.

1631
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:22,443
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life.

1632
02:05:22,986 --> 02:05:28,193
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm.

1633
02:05:28,777 --> 02:05:33,068
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients.

1634
02:05:33,152 --> 02:05:35,526
You're too straightforward.

1635
02:05:37,402 --> 02:05:38,235
But...

1636
02:05:39,402 --> 02:05:45,860
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude,

1637
02:05:45,986 --> 02:05:48,985
we may consider you.

1638
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:55,485
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet.

1639
02:05:57,361 --> 02:05:59,193
Wasn't easy to get this attitude.

1640
02:05:59,902 --> 02:06:00,776
Can't change it, sir.

1641
02:06:04,444 --> 02:06:09,693
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude.

1642
02:06:09,819 --> 02:06:11,193
I'm sorry, no offense, sir.

1643
02:06:15,569 --> 02:06:16,443
Wait.

1644
02:06:18,402 --> 02:06:22,401
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years.

1645
02:06:22,819 --> 02:06:25,693
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job.

1646
02:06:25,861 --> 02:06:27,235
Where did you spring from, son?

1647
02:06:29,152 --> 02:06:29,985
Sir?

1648
02:06:30,236 --> 02:06:32,860
Shall we discuss the salary?

1649
02:06:40,402 --> 02:06:41,318
Thank you, sir.

1650
02:07:13,861 --> 02:07:18,068
Your Majesty, thou art great.

1651
02:07:19,986 --> 02:07:21,651
Accept this humble offering.

1652
02:07:58,236 --> 02:08:01,693
Govind!

1653
02:08:03,736 --> 02:08:07,235
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'.

1654
02:08:14,444 --> 02:08:15,485
What have you done?

1655
02:08:19,069 --> 02:08:22,485
I feel naked without
my moustache.

1656
02:08:24,777 --> 02:08:26,693
I've lost my dignity.

1657
02:08:28,777 --> 02:08:31,235
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi.

1658
02:08:32,527 --> 02:08:36,568
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam.

1659
02:08:38,027 --> 02:08:41,985
And this time,
I will set the question paper.

1660
02:08:45,194 --> 02:08:47,776
Dad, that's not fair.

1661
02:08:50,111 --> 02:08:53,651
Everything is fair in
Love and War.

1662
02:08:54,152 --> 02:08:57,485
And this is World War... III

1663
02:08:58,944 --> 02:08:59,985
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1664
02:09:04,944 --> 02:09:05,860
Hey.

1665
02:09:08,277 --> 02:09:09,193
What're you doing here?

1666
02:09:12,152 --> 02:09:13,026
Be careful.

1667
02:09:18,694 --> 02:09:22,568
- You've been drinking.
- Yup, had to down a couple.

1668
02:09:23,111 --> 02:09:25,318
A couple too many!

1669
02:09:25,402 --> 02:09:27,318
- Needed the guts.
- For what?

1670
02:09:29,069 --> 02:09:30,610
- For stealing this.
- What's this?

1671
02:09:31,694 --> 02:09:35,860
The duplicate key to
Virus's office.

1672
02:09:38,361 --> 02:09:40,693
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal.

1673
02:09:41,361 --> 02:09:45,360
Dad has set it, to fail Raju.

1674
02:09:45,652 --> 02:09:46,610
Go get it!

1675
02:09:47,652 --> 02:09:50,235
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating!

1676
02:09:54,694 --> 02:09:57,943
Everything's fair in
Love and War.

1677
02:09:59,444 --> 02:10:00,485
Tell me something...

1678
02:10:02,402 --> 02:10:03,610
Do you really feel...

1679
02:10:05,152 --> 02:10:10,693
the noses collide while kissing?

1680
02:10:16,111 --> 02:10:19,860
Wait. Have some dhokla.

1681
02:10:22,319 --> 02:10:24,943
You Gujaratis are so cute.

1682
02:10:25,861 --> 02:10:29,193
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1683
02:10:30,277 --> 02:10:35,526
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra...

1684
02:10:36,652 --> 02:10:38,776
Sound like missiles.

1685
02:10:38,819 --> 02:10:39,693
C'mon.

1686
02:10:39,902 --> 02:10:42,401
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1687
02:10:43,027 --> 02:10:45,901
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1688
02:10:46,236 --> 02:10:47,151
C'mon.

1689
02:10:50,611 --> 02:10:51,610
Oh...

1690
02:10:53,111 --> 02:10:57,568
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1691
02:10:58,486 --> 02:11:01,818
'Ranchoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad' - Yuck.

1692
02:11:03,027 --> 02:11:05,610
I won't change my last name
after marriage.

1693
02:11:07,444 --> 02:11:10,443
Pia, we can't get married.

1694
02:11:13,986 --> 02:11:14,901
Why?

1695
02:11:15,736 --> 02:11:17,193
Is there someone else?

1696
02:11:19,694 --> 02:11:20,568
No.

1697
02:11:20,861 --> 02:11:22,610
- Are you gay?
- No.

1698
02:11:24,444 --> 02:11:26,360
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1699
02:11:30,902 --> 02:11:32,360
- Are you impotent?
- No.

1700
02:11:35,027 --> 02:11:36,860
Then prove it.

1701
02:11:37,319 --> 02:11:38,276
Pia, no.

1702
02:11:38,527 --> 02:11:39,985
Stop, stop!

1703
02:11:40,152 --> 02:11:42,526
- What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia.

1704
02:11:42,986 --> 02:11:45,068
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting.

1705
02:11:45,111 --> 02:11:46,985
- Shut up!
- Are you in touch with her?

1706
02:11:47,277 --> 02:11:50,443
- No... I have her home number.
- Then call her, I'll stop.

1707
02:11:56,902 --> 02:11:57,735
Hello.

1708
02:11:57,819 --> 02:12:00,068
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country.

1709
02:12:00,111 --> 02:12:03,526
- Hello, is Pia there?
- No, she's not.

1710
02:12:03,902 --> 02:12:05,693
Is she at the hospital?

1711
02:12:05,819 --> 02:12:07,401
Why would she be there?

1712
02:12:07,611 --> 02:12:09,818
She's getting married today
- in Manali

1713
02:12:17,819 --> 02:12:19,068
Too late! She's married.

1714
02:12:20,486 --> 02:12:23,401
Not yet. It's a six hour drive.

1715
02:12:23,736 --> 02:12:25,818
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows.

1716
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:27,193
What do you say?

1717
02:12:29,152 --> 02:12:31,568
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back.

1718
02:12:31,777 --> 02:12:33,526
No turning back.

1719
02:12:33,986 --> 02:12:36,735
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return.

1720
02:12:36,902 --> 02:12:39,485
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu.

1721
02:12:39,611 --> 02:12:41,151
Get into the car.

1722
02:12:41,402 --> 02:12:44,568
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him.

1723
02:12:44,944 --> 02:12:47,360
They're offering him a
first name in the company.

1724
02:12:47,486 --> 02:12:50,485
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1725
02:13:23,694 --> 02:13:25,860
- Pia weds Suhas!
- Thanks for the suit.

1726
02:13:28,194 --> 02:13:29,693
Virus will have a heart attack.

1727
02:13:30,777 --> 02:13:33,485
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1728
02:13:34,902 --> 02:13:38,318
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag.

1729
02:13:55,111 --> 02:13:57,360
- Farhan.
- We found Rancho.

1730
02:14:05,486 --> 02:14:07,110
- For Room 107?
- Yes, sir.

1731
02:14:07,819 --> 02:14:10,651
- You've taken ages.
- Sorry, sir.

1732
02:14:10,777 --> 02:14:11,651
Off, now.

1733
02:14:20,694 --> 02:14:22,401
- Housekeeping, sir.
- Come in.

1734
02:14:22,944 --> 02:14:25,568
Amore... Amore...

1735
02:14:25,652 --> 02:14:27,026
Quick, iron my coat.

1736
02:14:27,111 --> 02:14:29,985
Amore... Amore...

1737
02:14:30,819 --> 02:14:34,068
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass.

1738
02:14:34,569 --> 02:14:35,651
You're mad, Farhan.

1739
02:14:36,777 --> 02:14:39,443
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho.

1740
02:14:39,652 --> 02:14:41,610
You're still eating his favorite food.

1741
02:14:41,902 --> 02:14:44,568
Amore... Amore...

1742
02:14:59,944 --> 02:15:04,151
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag.

1743
02:15:04,236 --> 02:15:07,110
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man.

1744
02:15:07,652 --> 02:15:09,651
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore.

1745
02:15:09,694 --> 02:15:12,901
My 150,000/ - coat.

1746
02:15:12,986 --> 02:15:15,110
Why do you people eat sauce?

1747
02:15:15,152 --> 02:15:17,651
- I'll sort it out, sir.
- How?

1748
02:15:17,736 --> 02:15:20,318
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits.

1749
02:15:20,444 --> 02:15:22,443
I'll clean it in a jiffy.

1750
02:15:27,736 --> 02:15:29,068
Get it soon.

1751
02:15:30,027 --> 02:15:32,276
- But it's too late now, Farhan.
- Pia.

1752
02:15:33,152 --> 02:15:35,401
Let's go, Pia, we're late.

1753
02:15:46,819 --> 02:15:50,193
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me.

1754
02:15:55,319 --> 02:15:56,235
Where is Suhas?

1755
02:15:56,277 --> 02:15:59,026
Housekeeping took my coat.

1756
02:15:59,486 --> 02:16:01,276
Go... Send Suhas here.

1757
02:16:01,486 --> 02:16:04,693
It's rude to leave the ceremony.

1758
02:16:15,986 --> 02:16:17,651
- Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready.

1759
02:16:17,986 --> 02:16:20,610
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move.

1760
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:23,735
- Sir...
- My coat?

1761
02:16:23,777 --> 02:16:24,943
You're here...

1762
02:16:25,111 --> 02:16:26,735
- So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1763
02:16:29,027 --> 02:16:31,526
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married.

1764
02:16:31,694 --> 02:16:33,985
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go.

1765
02:16:34,444 --> 02:16:37,735
It's too late.
People will laugh at me.

1766
02:16:37,986 --> 02:16:39,776
So you'll commit suicide?

1767
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:41,276
Rastogi!

1768
02:16:41,361 --> 02:16:43,485
People will gossip briefly,
then forget.

1769
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:47,860
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed.

1770
02:16:47,944 --> 02:16:50,735
That the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1771
02:16:51,069 --> 02:16:54,568
but in fear of people,
you married this ass.

1772
02:16:56,736 --> 02:16:57,693
Housekeeping?

1773
02:17:37,402 --> 02:17:40,443
Pia, minor problem.

1774
02:17:40,736 --> 02:17:41,651
What?

1775
02:17:42,027 --> 02:17:43,651
We don't know if Rancho's married.

1776
02:17:43,736 --> 02:17:44,568
What!

1777
02:17:44,652 --> 02:17:47,318
- He won't be married.
- And if he is?

1778
02:17:48,194 --> 02:17:49,610
Then we'll drop you back.

1779
02:17:50,486 --> 02:17:54,276
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1780
02:17:58,111 --> 02:17:58,985
What's he doing here?

1781
02:18:00,027 --> 02:18:03,443
- Ignore him.
- The biscuit's very good.

1782
02:18:04,486 --> 02:18:06,360
Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen.

1783
02:18:06,861 --> 02:18:10,735
But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft...

1784
02:18:11,527 --> 02:18:13,985
almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and...

1785
02:18:14,236 --> 02:18:18,651
made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho.

1786
02:18:20,111 --> 02:18:22,235
But he too would do
anything for friends.

1787
02:18:22,486 --> 02:18:25,985
Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den.

1788
02:18:26,069 --> 02:18:27,110
Envelope with the red seal.

1789
02:18:28,111 --> 02:18:33,110
He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump

1790
02:18:36,277 --> 02:18:41,568
We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju.

1791
02:18:41,944 --> 02:18:43,068
We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek.

1792
02:18:45,777 --> 02:18:47,110
Where's it hidden...

1793
02:18:47,277 --> 02:18:50,901
We'll grow old searching!
Ask Pia.

1794
02:18:57,111 --> 02:18:58,276
Pia, your phone.

1795
02:18:59,527 --> 02:19:02,776
Mr. Papa-To-Be!
If you say 'All is well', he kicks.

1796
02:19:02,861 --> 02:19:03,693
He kicked.

1797
02:19:06,152 --> 02:19:07,651
Pia, your phone.

1798
02:19:13,486 --> 02:19:14,735
Found it! Rancho.

1799
02:19:16,194 --> 02:19:17,193
Hello?

1800
02:19:35,611 --> 02:19:37,860
Quick, photocopy this.

1801
02:19:58,944 --> 02:19:59,818
Where was it?

1802
02:20:00,111 --> 02:20:01,110
Put it back.

1803
02:20:24,444 --> 02:20:26,485
- We're safe!
- Where were you?

1804
02:20:31,069 --> 02:20:32,776
- Here.
- What's this?

1805
02:20:33,111 --> 02:20:34,026
A gift.

1806
02:20:35,152 --> 02:20:39,068
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you.

1807
02:20:46,652 --> 02:20:47,985
Strange buddies!

1808
02:20:49,319 --> 02:20:53,901
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame.

1809
02:20:55,944 --> 02:20:56,985
No way!

1810
02:20:58,569 --> 02:20:59,943
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam.

1811
02:21:03,819 --> 02:21:04,985
If I don't, it's still ok.

1812
02:21:22,194 --> 02:21:26,735
He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...

1813
02:21:27,652 --> 02:21:29,568
but then I controlled my emotions.

1814
02:21:48,652 --> 02:21:51,651
- Damn thief.
- Sir, please, sir.

1815
02:21:51,777 --> 02:21:54,985
- Rascal.
- Sorry sir.

1816
02:21:55,527 --> 02:21:56,818
Wanted to change the system?

1817
02:21:58,527 --> 02:22:03,485
- You'll pee on my door.
- Sir, what're you doing?

1818
02:22:04,986 --> 02:22:05,985
Sorry sir.

1819
02:22:07,444 --> 02:22:09,318
You are rusticated!

1820
02:22:10,111 --> 02:22:13,110
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police.

1821
02:22:13,527 --> 02:22:14,860
I will call the police!

1822
02:22:17,361 --> 02:22:18,193
Rascals!

1823
02:22:18,527 --> 02:22:19,860
Rascals, all of you.

1824
02:22:23,861 --> 02:22:26,193
How did he get my office key?

1825
02:22:27,486 --> 02:22:28,901
I gave him the key, Dad.

1826
02:22:30,277 --> 02:22:33,901
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today.

1827
02:22:34,069 --> 02:22:34,985
Stop it, Pia.

1828
02:22:36,111 --> 02:22:38,943
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1829
02:22:39,486 --> 02:22:40,401
Shut up, Pia.

1830
02:22:40,486 --> 02:22:42,776
You decided he'd be an engineer.

1831
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:45,235
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1832
02:22:46,027 --> 02:22:47,610
You put such pressure on him...

1833
02:22:47,986 --> 02:22:50,276
that he chose death
over the entrance exam.

1834
02:22:54,527 --> 02:22:55,401
I don't understand...

1835
02:22:56,194 --> 02:22:58,776
Dad, you go to your room.

1836
02:23:02,652 --> 02:23:05,026
Pia, don't do this.

1837
02:23:07,486 --> 02:23:11,401
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer.

1838
02:23:13,652 --> 02:23:16,151
But all he wrote was
this suicide note.

1839
02:23:16,194 --> 02:23:17,485
Put that away, please.

1840
02:23:17,652 --> 02:23:19,318
No more cover-ups!

1841
02:23:22,694 --> 02:23:25,943
Just once...

1842
02:23:25,986 --> 02:23:29,693
if you'd said - Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to...

1843
02:23:30,527 --> 02:23:31,943
just do what your heart is in...

1844
02:23:33,402 --> 02:23:35,151
then he'd be alive today.

1845
02:23:43,069 --> 02:23:45,151
He didn't commit suicide.

1846
02:23:45,861 --> 02:23:46,860
You're right, Dad.

1847
02:23:48,402 --> 02:23:49,651
It wasn't suicide...

1848
02:23:52,111 --> 02:23:53,193
It was murder.

1849
02:24:09,111 --> 02:24:11,985
<i>Many city roads are
completely submerged.</i>

1850
02:24:12,027 --> 02:24:14,026
<i>Traffic has come to a standstill.</i>

1851
02:24:27,944 --> 02:24:31,776
Dad...

1852
02:24:32,861 --> 02:24:33,818
Mona?

1853
02:24:37,986 --> 02:24:40,485
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1854
02:24:41,027 --> 02:24:43,318
Why?
Your pop owns the road?

1855
02:24:43,444 --> 02:24:45,151
Please help,
we are desperate here!

1856
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:47,985
You can't send an ambulance?

1857
02:24:48,986 --> 02:24:50,901
Get it from another hospital.

1858
02:24:51,527 --> 02:24:55,068
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless.

1859
02:24:58,569 --> 02:24:59,860
Mona, you ok?

1860
02:25:00,402 --> 02:25:01,401
Rancho, Pia.

1861
02:25:03,777 --> 02:25:07,651
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say.

1862
02:25:07,944 --> 02:25:12,818
The water bag has burst.

1863
02:25:13,819 --> 02:25:16,360
Disconnected! Mona.

1864
02:25:21,569 --> 02:25:22,568
Mona!

1865
02:25:26,944 --> 02:25:28,485
- Turn on the lights.
- Where to?

1866
02:25:28,986 --> 02:25:32,943
- To the table tennis table.
- Pia, we're in the common room.

1867
02:25:36,902 --> 02:25:38,776
Raju, turn on the web camera.

1868
02:25:44,902 --> 02:25:46,068
Where's Mona? Show me.

1869
02:25:47,611 --> 02:25:48,568
Hold on.

1870
02:25:50,777 --> 02:25:51,651
Here, Pia.

1871
02:25:51,944 --> 02:25:54,860
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you.

1872
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,943
Pia, I'm dying!

1873
02:25:56,319 --> 02:25:58,943
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs...

1874
02:25:59,069 --> 02:26:00,485
babies were delivered.

1875
02:26:01,069 --> 02:26:03,401
You all will deliver this baby.

1876
02:26:06,069 --> 02:26:07,651
All is well.

1877
02:26:07,777 --> 02:26:10,776
How dare you? I'll kill you.

1878
02:26:10,902 --> 02:26:12,943
Dad, stay out of this.

1879
02:26:13,902 --> 02:26:16,068
Farhan, get towels and scissors.

1880
02:26:16,111 --> 02:26:18,610
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water.

1881
02:26:18,861 --> 02:26:20,360
Rancho, cover Mona.

1882
02:26:27,902 --> 02:26:29,443
Mona, try pushing.

1883
02:26:29,861 --> 02:26:33,818
Push with all your might.

1884
02:26:34,069 --> 02:26:36,485
Stop it! I can't do it.

1885
02:26:36,694 --> 02:26:38,526
Rancho, check if there's crowning.

1886
02:26:39,444 --> 02:26:40,318
Crowning...?

1887
02:26:41,652 --> 02:26:42,568
Get that diagram.

1888
02:26:45,486 --> 02:26:48,235
See if the head is coming out.

1889
02:26:50,569 --> 02:26:51,901
Check quickly.

1890
02:26:52,694 --> 02:26:53,610
Go!

1891
02:26:54,277 --> 02:26:56,776
Go, Rancho, go.

1892
02:27:04,027 --> 02:27:06,151
No crowning.

1893
02:27:06,236 --> 02:27:08,110
Mona, please push.

1894
02:27:10,777 --> 02:27:11,651
Mona!

1895
02:27:14,652 --> 02:27:15,818
She's tired, Pia.

1896
02:27:16,236 --> 02:27:19,943
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem.

1897
02:27:20,277 --> 02:27:24,068
- They need a vacuum cup.
- Where will they get one?

1898
02:27:24,236 --> 02:27:27,110
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1899
02:27:27,361 --> 02:27:28,235
I'll show you.

1900
02:27:31,486 --> 02:27:35,818
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head.

1901
02:27:36,111 --> 02:27:39,901
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1902
02:27:40,611 --> 02:27:42,485
and the baby is pulled out.

1903
02:27:42,944 --> 02:27:45,151
- I can make this.
- How?

1904
02:27:45,402 --> 02:27:47,235
- With a vacuum cleaner.
- Vacuum cleaner?

1905
02:27:47,277 --> 02:27:48,360
Yes.

1906
02:27:48,402 --> 02:27:50,776
That pressure's too high.

1907
02:27:50,819 --> 02:27:52,985
- I'll control it.
- D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1908
02:27:53,027 --> 02:27:54,110
Yes, in my office.

1909
02:27:54,527 --> 02:27:57,276
- Farhan, rush and get it.
- Here's the key.

1910
02:28:03,236 --> 02:28:06,693
Mona, push.

1911
02:28:07,444 --> 02:28:08,985
Oh my God!

1912
02:28:09,861 --> 02:28:10,776
What happened?

1913
02:28:15,652 --> 02:28:17,943
- Raju, what happened?
- The power's gone.

1914
02:28:18,902 --> 02:28:20,360
How'll the vacuum work now?

1915
02:28:20,402 --> 02:28:22,985
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1916
02:28:23,027 --> 02:28:24,026
How?

1917
02:28:24,694 --> 02:28:26,193
Millimeter, get Virus out.

1918
02:28:27,569 --> 02:28:30,235
What nonsense is this?

1919
02:28:30,444 --> 02:28:34,026
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter.

1920
02:28:34,194 --> 02:28:36,110
- Get that, quick.
- Ok.

1921
02:28:36,361 --> 02:28:38,526
Raju, wake up the hostel.

1922
02:28:38,694 --> 02:28:41,651
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge.

1923
02:28:44,486 --> 02:28:47,151
Emergency in the common room!

1924
02:29:17,944 --> 02:29:20,068
- Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir.

1925
02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:23,026
Keep the batteries here
... and the wires.

1926
02:29:25,277 --> 02:29:28,485
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains.

1927
02:29:33,277 --> 02:29:34,485
Rancho, vacuum cleaner.

1928
02:29:35,611 --> 02:29:38,526
Farhan, get your lens cleaner.

1929
02:29:38,569 --> 02:29:40,026
- Blower?
- Yeah, get it.

1930
02:29:42,736 --> 02:29:43,776
Rancho, blower.

1931
02:29:43,902 --> 02:29:45,943
Good. Fix this to the gauge.

1932
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:13,610
Rancho, I'm done.

1933
02:30:16,027 --> 02:30:17,193
- All switches off?
- Yes.

1934
02:30:18,736 --> 02:30:20,360
Hit the table
and computer switches.

1935
02:30:20,402 --> 02:30:21,276
Ok.

1936
02:30:33,944 --> 02:30:35,068
Raju, turn on the computer.

1937
02:30:35,444 --> 02:30:37,151
Farhan, here.

1938
02:30:39,236 --> 02:30:41,276
Pia, come here quick.

1939
02:30:43,736 --> 02:30:44,860
Love you, Rancho.

1940
02:30:45,611 --> 02:30:47,610
- Farhan, turn it on.
- Ok.

1941
02:30:54,152 --> 02:30:56,193
Pia, how much suction?

1942
02:30:56,569 --> 02:30:58,026
Not more than 0.5!

1943
02:30:58,236 --> 02:31:00,276
- Farhan, 0.5!
- Cover it.

1944
02:31:01,819 --> 02:31:02,735
0.5!

1945
02:31:05,277 --> 02:31:09,318
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries.

1946
02:31:10,402 --> 02:31:11,235
Farhan, stop.

1947
02:31:11,277 --> 02:31:12,110
Ok.

1948
02:31:18,527 --> 02:31:19,860
Raju, get on the table.

1949
02:31:20,111 --> 02:31:23,276
Push the baby down, like this.

1950
02:31:23,444 --> 02:31:24,401
Ok.

1951
02:31:25,486 --> 02:31:26,401
Farhan, turn it on.

1952
02:31:30,986 --> 02:31:33,318
C'mon, you can do it.

1953
02:31:34,444 --> 02:31:36,901
C'mon, push.

1954
02:31:41,069 --> 02:31:43,651
Do it for Champ.

1955
02:31:43,861 --> 02:31:46,318
C'mon, Mona.

1956
02:31:48,027 --> 02:31:50,110
He's coming out!

1957
02:31:51,444 --> 02:31:53,235
You can do it.

1958
02:31:54,027 --> 02:31:56,401
Yes Mona, push.

1959
02:32:04,236 --> 02:32:05,318
Farhan, turn it off.

1960
02:32:05,402 --> 02:32:06,443
Ok, off.

1961
02:32:26,694 --> 02:32:28,485
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord.

1962
02:32:28,777 --> 02:32:30,985
Farhan, two clips on the cord.

1963
02:32:31,694 --> 02:32:33,735
- Get scissors.
- Be careful!

1964
02:32:34,944 --> 02:32:37,235
Cut at the center,
get a towel.

1965
02:32:40,027 --> 02:32:42,360
Pia, he's not crying.

1966
02:32:46,611 --> 02:32:49,526
Hey Champ!

1967
02:32:50,861 --> 02:32:53,318
Rancho, rub his back.

1968
02:32:55,569 --> 02:32:57,610
- Hey Champ!
- Come on, Champ.

1969
02:32:59,444 --> 02:33:01,568
No, nothing.

1970
02:33:02,027 --> 02:33:03,068
Blow air into his mouth.

1971
02:33:10,236 --> 02:33:11,068
C'mon, Champ.

1972
02:33:16,611 --> 02:33:17,485
No response.

1973
02:33:41,819 --> 02:33:45,443
Hush Mona, say -
All is well.

1974
02:33:50,694 --> 02:33:51,651
He kicked.

1975
02:33:52,944 --> 02:33:53,818
What?

1976
02:33:54,694 --> 02:33:55,985
He kicked.

1977
02:33:59,444 --> 02:34:00,776
Say - All is well.

1978
02:34:02,402 --> 02:34:09,318
All is well.

1979
02:34:50,736 --> 02:34:54,110
If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'...

1980
02:34:54,236 --> 02:34:56,110
I would've broken his jaw.

1981
02:34:56,777 --> 02:34:59,610
But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us.

1982
02:34:59,902 --> 02:35:03,068
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1983
02:35:04,111 --> 02:35:07,151
Be what you want to be.

1984
02:35:23,611 --> 02:35:27,526
Wait - I've not finished with you!

1985
02:35:29,902 --> 02:35:32,485
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1986
02:35:32,819 --> 02:35:35,235
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1987
02:35:35,986 --> 02:35:38,276
If a pencil tip breaks...

1988
02:35:38,444 --> 02:35:44,360
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1989
02:35:44,486 --> 02:35:46,443
You were wrong!

1990
02:35:48,027 --> 02:35:49,901
You cannot be right all the time.

1991
02:35:51,986 --> 02:35:53,026
You understand?

1992
02:35:55,444 --> 02:35:56,318
Yes, sir.

1993
02:35:57,569 --> 02:35:59,693
This was an important invention.

1994
02:36:00,986 --> 02:36:02,026
You understand?

1995
02:36:03,402 --> 02:36:04,276
Yes, sir.

1996
02:36:06,819 --> 02:36:15,235
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student...'

1997
02:36:34,069 --> 02:36:38,526
Go, study!
Pass your exams and leave.

1998
02:36:47,402 --> 02:36:49,526
And now, Student of the Year...

1999
02:36:49,736 --> 02:36:52,235
Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

2000
02:37:09,861 --> 02:37:11,193
Sir, one photo.

2001
02:37:28,652 --> 02:37:32,110
I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home.

2002
02:37:34,152 --> 02:37:39,568
That day, we hugged,
we rejoiced, we cried...

2003
02:37:39,819 --> 02:37:41,485
We vowed that we'd meet
at least once a year...

2004
02:37:42,152 --> 02:37:45,610
Who knew then, we were seeing
Rancho for the last time.

2005
02:38:19,527 --> 02:38:20,485
Untie him.

2006
02:38:23,819 --> 02:38:25,735
I'll sue you all in an
American court.

2007
02:38:40,194 --> 02:38:41,068
Raju.

2008
02:39:00,069 --> 02:39:02,068
Only Rancho can create
a school like this.

2009
02:39:02,611 --> 02:39:03,693
But where is he?

2010
02:39:08,152 --> 02:39:09,401
Don't pee here.

2011
02:39:10,486 --> 02:39:12,110
Go away creatures.

2012
02:39:12,486 --> 02:39:15,568
- Don't pee here.
- I'll smack you.

2013
02:39:33,319 --> 02:39:35,526
Bingo! He cannot be far.

2014
02:39:46,986 --> 02:39:49,276
Excuse me,
where is Ranchoddas?

2015
02:39:49,402 --> 02:39:51,401
- He's not Ranchoddas!
- Rancho...

2016
02:39:51,486 --> 02:39:53,693
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2017
02:39:53,819 --> 02:39:56,526
Calm down. Come with me.

2018
02:39:58,986 --> 02:39:59,901
- Where's he?
- Rancho.

2019
02:40:07,277 --> 02:40:10,443
Farhan, he's read all your books.

2020
02:40:16,736 --> 02:40:22,776
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids.

2021
02:40:26,277 --> 02:40:29,776
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2022
02:40:31,694 --> 02:40:34,901
Who are you?
How do you know us?

2023
02:40:35,152 --> 02:40:37,235
- Didn't you recognize me?
- No.

2024
02:40:38,152 --> 02:40:42,151
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter.

2025
02:40:47,194 --> 02:40:51,693
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer.

2026
02:40:52,527 --> 02:40:53,526
How did you get here?

2027
02:40:53,611 --> 02:40:56,860
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside.

2028
02:40:57,111 --> 02:41:00,860
It said - 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did.

2029
02:41:02,444 --> 02:41:03,568
That rascal Rancho!

2030
02:41:07,736 --> 02:41:08,735
Where is that idiot?

2031
02:41:19,902 --> 02:41:21,818
Dorje, you fly it.

2032
02:41:36,777 --> 02:41:42,276
Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride.

2033
02:41:43,194 --> 02:41:45,485
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet...

2034
02:41:46,111 --> 02:41:48,860
and come close to kiss me.

2035
02:41:52,444 --> 02:41:53,693
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2036
02:41:56,027 --> 02:41:56,860
No.

2037
02:41:58,652 --> 02:41:59,568
Sorry.

2038
02:41:59,944 --> 02:42:00,776
Did you marry?

2039
02:42:01,361 --> 02:42:05,610
What? No.

2040
02:42:06,569 --> 02:42:09,193
- You?
- Almost... Idiot.

2041
02:42:16,777 --> 02:42:17,651
So?

2042
02:42:19,111 --> 02:42:20,110
So what?

2043
02:42:20,611 --> 02:42:21,943
Do you love someone?

2044
02:42:26,361 --> 02:42:27,193
Yes.

2045
02:42:33,236 --> 02:42:34,110
Who?

2046
02:42:35,402 --> 02:42:36,276
You.

2047
02:43:01,986 --> 02:43:05,193
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid.

2048
02:43:06,402 --> 02:43:07,235
That's right!

2049
02:43:07,486 --> 02:43:08,610
Rancho.

2050
02:43:10,111 --> 02:43:10,985
Hi... Farhan!

2051
02:43:11,152 --> 02:43:13,276
Screw your 'Hi'.

2052
02:43:13,694 --> 02:43:18,443
Hey, listen to me...
No, you listen to me.

2053
02:43:18,611 --> 02:43:20,901
I can explain everything.

2054
02:43:21,986 --> 02:43:22,860
Hi... Raju!

2055
02:43:22,902 --> 02:43:24,818
How we hunted for you!

2056
02:43:27,694 --> 02:43:31,818
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2057
02:43:33,861 --> 02:43:36,151
Add a couple from me too.

2058
02:43:36,694 --> 02:43:41,901
- Rascal, scoundrel!
- Let him go now.

2059
02:43:42,027 --> 02:43:42,985
Ok ok, enough.

2060
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:46,110
On your feet, c'mon.

2061
02:44:16,111 --> 02:44:17,860
Having fun, idiots?

2062
02:44:18,111 --> 02:44:19,985
Hey... Hi Chatur.

2063
02:44:20,277 --> 02:44:25,360
Ranchoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2064
02:44:25,777 --> 02:44:32,568
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2065
02:44:34,486 --> 02:44:39,235
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2066
02:44:39,777 --> 02:44:42,693
from engineer to primary teacher.

2067
02:44:44,861 --> 02:44:47,776
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000/-?

2068
02:44:48,152 --> 02:44:49,943
For me that's $ 100.

2069
02:44:50,361 --> 02:44:53,776
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary.

2070
02:44:53,944 --> 02:44:56,735
- Cut the crap.
- Crap is what he gave us.

2071
02:44:56,902 --> 02:45:01,985
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world.

2072
02:45:02,194 --> 02:45:04,776
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers.

2073
02:45:05,236 --> 02:45:06,651
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2074
02:45:06,819 --> 02:45:07,735
Just relax.

2075
02:45:07,819 --> 02:45:14,610
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2076
02:45:16,277 --> 02:45:23,068
Sign here.
Accept - You lost, I won!

2077
02:45:23,319 --> 02:45:26,360
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man.

2078
02:45:26,527 --> 02:45:28,610
- Chatur...
- Crazy guy.

2079
02:45:30,402 --> 02:45:34,735
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2080
02:45:35,152 --> 02:45:36,568
Forget it, man.

2081
02:45:37,236 --> 02:45:40,943
This is for winners, not losers.

2082
02:45:42,027 --> 02:45:49,026
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation.

2083
02:45:51,152 --> 02:45:53,985
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2084
02:45:55,486 --> 02:45:58,276
- He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him.

2085
02:45:58,402 --> 02:45:59,901
He's full of crap.

2086
02:46:00,236 --> 02:46:04,651
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchoddas Chanchad.

2087
02:46:05,027 --> 02:46:09,068
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad - Yuck!

2088
02:46:09,819 --> 02:46:11,318
By the way,
what is your real name?

2089
02:46:12,152 --> 02:46:13,068
Phunsukh Wangdu.

2090
02:46:13,861 --> 02:46:14,776
Wangdu?

2091
02:46:14,944 --> 02:46:15,818
Pia Wangdu!

2092
02:46:16,486 --> 02:46:18,235
You mean you're a scientist?

2093
02:46:18,444 --> 02:46:19,776
You have 400 patents?

2094
02:46:19,902 --> 02:46:21,776
I won't change my name
after marriage.

2095
02:46:21,819 --> 02:46:23,443
You mean you're Chatur's
Wangdu?

2096
02:46:23,527 --> 02:46:25,735
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2097
02:46:25,777 --> 02:46:26,693
I don't like Wangdu.

2098
02:46:27,277 --> 02:46:29,485
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2099
02:46:29,902 --> 02:46:31,860
Scientist,
but I also teach children.

2100
02:46:31,902 --> 02:46:34,026
So you are
THE Phunsukh Wangdu?

2101
02:46:34,069 --> 02:46:35,235
Yes, yes!

2102
02:46:36,486 --> 02:46:39,401
- Hey Silencer.
- Hey Chatur, come back.

2103
02:46:40,652 --> 02:46:41,776
Take that.

2104
02:46:43,319 --> 02:46:45,610
Wait, I'll stop him.

2105
02:46:53,486 --> 02:46:57,110
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you.

2106
02:46:57,611 --> 02:46:58,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur.

2107
02:46:58,944 --> 02:47:01,276
I can't sign the deal
with your company.

2108
02:47:01,777 --> 02:47:03,818
What sir? Why sir?

2109
02:47:04,027 --> 02:47:06,860
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen.

2110
02:47:08,736 --> 02:47:10,735
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2111
02:47:11,069 --> 02:47:15,276
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen.

2112
02:47:18,777 --> 02:47:20,276
Mr. Wangdu...?

2113
02:47:20,444 --> 02:47:21,651
Yes, Chatur?

2114
02:47:22,444 --> 02:47:24,443
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2115
02:47:27,569 --> 02:47:29,235
S for Screwed.

2116
02:47:36,361 --> 02:47:40,485
You got me, Rancho.
I mean, Mr. Wangdu.

2117
02:47:40,861 --> 02:47:42,485
Totally floored me. Good one.

2118
02:47:43,152 --> 02:47:47,443
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal.

2119
02:47:47,611 --> 02:47:50,818
Hey Chatur, take that.

2120
02:47:51,444 --> 02:47:53,443
I was just joking, man.

2121
02:47:53,819 --> 02:47:57,693
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things.

2122
02:47:58,694 --> 02:48:00,485
You're fibbing.

2123
02:48:00,569 --> 02:48:02,526
No, really, I swear.

2124
02:48:02,611 --> 02:48:04,610
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0

2125
02:48:04,986 --> 02:48:07,318
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2126
02:48:08,736 --> 02:48:10,110
Beware of farts.

2127
02:48:10,152 --> 02:48:14,443
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering.

2128
02:48:14,527 --> 02:48:16,901
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life!

2129
02:48:20,611 --> 02:48:24,693
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2130
02:48:25,652 --> 02:48:28,193
His Holiness Guru Ranchoddas
had correctly stated.

2131
02:48:28,402 --> 02:48:33,485
Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down.

2132
02:48:35,555 --> 02:48:40,000
