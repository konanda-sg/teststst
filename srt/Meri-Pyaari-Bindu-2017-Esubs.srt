1
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,780
A quiet evening.
The birds have flown home.

2
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,120
A courtyard bathed in light.
A tired football game.

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,690
An old song on the radio.

4
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,070
A silent dog.

5
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,490
Suddenly the clang of cymbals.

6
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,250
And Goddess Durga appears
in the sky.

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,750
All eyes follow her.

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,040
Manohar uncle is stunned,
so are Kamla and Vimla.

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,070
Her shadow looms
over the neighbourhood...

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,530
...tearing through the sky,
as "She" advances.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,710
But no one knew...

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,080
...on a roof in that same lane...

13
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,300
...a man stood between
life and death.

14
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,430
They say your life flashes in front
of your eyes before you die.

15
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,810
But the only thing he could see...

16
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,100
...was the face of that girl.

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,990
Many teach you how to love...

18
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,150
...alas no one teaches you
how to forget that love.

19
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,080
"My Sweet Bindu."

20
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,470
Love is not an easy thing.

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,680
This much I know.

22
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,010
You are a river of fire.
I do not know how to swim.

23
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,380
You do not know how
to drown.

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,430
Miss Chawla...

25
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,140
You seem very opposed to
Abhimanyu Roy's novels.

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
His stories are exploitative.

27
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,980
His worlds, dark and bitter.

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,190
All his characters are like him,
negative, angry and horny.

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,070
And he portrays all his women
as heartless witches.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,370
None of his characters are real,
I tell you.

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,050
Mr. Roy?

32
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,050
Obviously my characters
aren't real.

33
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,930
I would hardly want
a scary ghost...

34
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,680
...wearing a saree sitting
next to me.

35
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,760
I much prefer a Miss India.

36
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,930
See?

37
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,350
That's the problem.

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,190
He never discusses
anything real...

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,560
...just hides behind cheap humor.

40
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Sir, take this.

41
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,480
Love is not an easy thing.

42
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,030
This much I know.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,120
You are a river of fire.
I do not know how to swim.

44
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,240
You could write poetry or crime
thrillers. Why horror stories?

45
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,500
When today's youth prefer
love stories.

46
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,920
So? Boy meets girl, they
live happily ever after. The End.

47
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,500
Everybody writes love stories.

48
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,840
Bankers, insurance agents,
housewives.

49
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,380
Horror is really interesting
as a genre.

50
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,260
The more you scare people,
the more they want to be scared.

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,510
All the best, sir.

52
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,930
"The Witch's Blouse."

53
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,100
I cannot tell you how many
copies it has sold!

54
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,230
It's broken the 10-year record
of the English-Hindi dictionary.

55
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,780
- Can I take a selfie?
- Sure.

56
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,200
Three years have gone by...

57
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,040
...when is your next book?

58
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,340
Love is not an easy thing.

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,550
This much I know.

60
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,240
You are a river of fire.
I do not know how to swim.

61
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,420
Of course. It's the paper's
fault, Abhi.

62
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,360
How much longer?

63
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,900
We need a book.
You need a book.

64
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,570
Your goldfish needs a book.

65
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,700
Stop eating ketchup
and bread all day!

66
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,620
You smoke non-stop.
You don't answer any calls.

67
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,540
I'm fed up of calling.
God answers but not you.

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,750
Quiet!

69
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,050
The publisher paid you
two years ago.

70
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,130
- He's chasing me.
- I don't care.

71
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,510
His kid used to dirty my lap with
his goo. Now he googles all day.

72
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,760
Tell you what...

73
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,390
- Give me a date.
- Give me space.

74
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,860
It's a love story.

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,440
I knew you'd make me proud.

76
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,320
Don't do that!

77
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,280
A normal love story, right?
Girl-meets-boy?

78
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,580
Girl-girl?

79
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,870
Boy-meets-boy?

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,250
- Girl-meets-horse?
- Are you mad?

81
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,250
People write strange stuff.
Take Black Beauty.

82
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,640
You're the limit.

83
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,350
You won't get any ideas...

84
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,930
...locked indoors. At least
open the window!

85
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,730
Let the air in. Ideas will
float into the room.

86
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,320
- Donâ€™t you have a copy?
- No!

87
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,650
Why don't you use a laptop
like normal writers?

88
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,150
Everything is online.
Even railway bookings.

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,450
I'll kill you.

90
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,370
Ma, I'm busy. Call you back.

91
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,090
You're always busy, Bubla.
That's why this has happened.

92
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,670
What's happened?

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,130
Better you hear it from me
than someone else.

94
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,930
Your father and I are getting
divorced.

95
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,390
- You're cracking up.
- I'm cracked?

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,470
Your voice is cracking up.
I'll call you back.

97
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,520
Your baba and I...

98
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,560
Baba is on hold.

99
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,060
Baba, what's up?

100
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,150
- Cutting me out of your will?
- We're getting divorced.

101
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,530
Bubla?

102
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,790
Have you heard?
Bubla is coming to Kolkata.

103
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,170
Really?

104
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,920
He's coming?

105
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,380
When do we see him?

106
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,800
My son is coming home.
The best pieces, please.

107
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,350
Hope he'll stay long?

108
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,640
Bubla's coming? Wow!

109
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,350
Lemon tea for everyone!

110
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,980
Nephew landing.

111
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,630
How are you?

112
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,130
Who is he?

113
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,510
Come inside. I'll tell you.

114
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,230
Is he here?

115
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,810
Mind your backs!

116
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,020
Surprise!

117
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,160
Ma...

118
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,710
Nephew, listen to me.

119
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,500
- You write so well.
- Come here.

120
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,340
- We're first in line.
- Let me go.

121
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,590
Give me a good hug.

122
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,390
What happened to that girl?

123
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,470
Left him, right?

124
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
You're so thin. Eat!

125
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,850
Nephew, hear me out.

126
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,140
You've written a terrific book.

127
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,940
Keep on scaring us.

128
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,900
How about some whiskey? Neat?

129
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,690
That's Vodka.

130
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,610
Same difference.
Do you remember me?

131
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,410
- Bhooby aunty.
- Bhooby aunty?

132
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,290
Bhooby aunty from Salt Lake.

133
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,750
Bhooby aunty. How could I forget?

134
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,000
Naughty!

135
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,330
Why are you so stressed?

136
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,880
What is all this?

137
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,050
It was her idea.

138
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,010
It was my idea?

139
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,890
You always say I never
give you any credit.

140
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,720
- Meaning?
- The divorce yarn.

141
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
How could you imagine I'd ask
your mother for anything...

142
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,360
...let alone a divorce.

143
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,860
If I committed suicide at my age,
what would people say?

144
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,240
Baba, you...

145
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,910
You haven't come home
for ages.

146
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,740
Unbelievable, Ma. I have to finish
my book and...

147
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,830
You make me come all the way
to drink Vodka with Aunt Bhooby.

148
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,870
We were missing you.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,540
No more surprises, I hope?

150
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,210
Next Wednesday...
it's your father's birthday.

151
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,510
Now that you're here...

152
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,760
...I thought we'd have a small party
for selected guests.

153
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,550
Only close family and friends.
Speak up!

154
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,470
That's good. Quiet now!

155
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,020
- Couldn't you tell me on the phone?
- Would you have come?

156
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,650
Come. Come. The family photo.

157
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,530
You can't manage anything.
You prefer Vodka to your son.

158
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,240
- It helps me acting.
- Don't over do it.

159
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,410
I can't overact as naturally as you.

160
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,450
What happens when he finds out
about your other plan?

161
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,160
Why shouldn't I?

162
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,830
He's just wasting his life...

163
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,170
...because of that girl.

164
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,260
My boy, Devdas! How are you?
I missed that face.

165
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,270
Give me a hug!

166
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,650
Please have some.

167
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,770
Come with me.

168
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,530
Hurry up!

169
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,580
My daughter is an avid reader.

170
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,620
Rabindranath Tagore
is her favourite.

171
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,370
Then Satyajit Ray.
Then "Edin" Blyton.

172
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,080
You come a close fourth.

173
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,250
I love Das Cabin.

174
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,250
What a concept. Gripping!

175
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,760
Read us something.

176
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,050
Wow.

177
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,140
If you're feeling shy,
give it to me, I'll read.

178
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,060
Give it to me.

179
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,690
I did a lot of theatre in college.

180
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,820
"Maya's body was now wrapped
around Ravi."

181
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,820
"Nice trousers," she says.

182
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
"She puts her hand into his pocket.

183
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,990
"He attacks her like a hungry
Bengali businessman...

184
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,620
"...attacks a plate of hot samosas...

185
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,710
"...after a hard day at work.

186
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,590
"As Maya starts moaning...

187
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
- "Yes."
- No.

188
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,760
That's enough.

189
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,470
Enough.

190
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,770
Sometimes, it's about
publisher demands...

191
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,730
All right. We better be going.

192
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,610
Let's go.

193
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,320
Das Cabin? Gripping!

194
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,320
Baba, no ghost came?

195
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,110
No, someone else did.

196
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,830
Baba.

197
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,290
She's sweet.

198
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,540
Ma, are you serious?

199
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,460
OK. You tell me what kind
of girl you want?

200
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,510
Her hair was like the inky night.

201
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,810
Her eyes were like traffic lights.
Red. Green. Red. Green.

202
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,690
Her fragrance ran through
my veins like molten lava...

203
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,740
Looking for something?

204
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,330
You. I didn't know
you were here.

205
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,540
- I am here.
- I can see that.

206
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,040
I heard you committed suicide.

207
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,420
So that wasn't you?

208
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,500
Obviously not.

209
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,970
She isn't here.

210
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,700
- Are you recording?
- Yes.

211
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,280
These are Bindu and Abhi's
top ten favourite songs.

212
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,830
Not favourite songs. But songs
that are part of our lives.

213
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,830
So this is the soundtrack to
the lives of Abhi and Bindu.

214
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,710
Don't go away, don't leave me now...

215
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:29,550
...my heart hasn't
had its fill of you.

216
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,100
Some songs become part
of your life.

217
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,480
Wrapped in their tunes are stories,
big and small.

218
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,530
Many memories.

219
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,410
Bindu and I had filled a cassette
with our memories.

220
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,870
Our mixed tape.

221
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,380
Our 4x2.5" dirty secret.

222
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,510
A tape filled with Lata, Kishore,
Asha, Rafi, RD, Bappi-da.

223
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,470
And Bindu.

224
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,970
Don't go away, don't leave me now...

225
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,270
...my heart hasn't
had its fill of you.

226
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,110
"My Sweet Bindu."

227
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,950
In one word - she was "trouble."

228
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,410
She was unusual,
a little crazy.

229
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,750
Forever changing her mind.

230
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,670
She was madly in love with life...

231
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,380
...but she loved herself
a little more.

232
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,260
At age 6...

233
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,130
...she played a bee in a school play.

234
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,220
She adored her costume so much,
she kept it on for a week.

235
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,180
A week later...

236
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,480
...she threw it out like
an old toy.

237
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,600
Never wore it again.

238
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,110
What will you be
when you grow up?

239
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,990
Her answer changed every day.

240
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,490
A Prime Minister,
a washer-woman, a nurse.

241
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,620
Then one day she saw the film
"Guide" on TV.

242
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,370
She thought Waheeda
was singing herself...

243
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,880
...so every singer was
as beautiful as Waheeda.

244
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,710
Was it Waheeda's magic
or Lata Mangeshkar's...

245
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,300
...she had to be a singer.

246
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,510
I'll have an army of fans.
Wait and see!

247
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,140
She adored her mother.

248
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,810
She taught her that
life was like melting ice-cream.

249
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,600
Gobble it up or it'll get wasted.

250
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,020
She was scared of her father.

251
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,650
Her father, the Major, stumbled home
drunk every night.

252
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,030
If he was in a bad mood,
he'd lock Bindu in the bathroom.

253
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,620
But who could tie her down?

254
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,870
She had wheels under her feet.

255
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,290
She never settled for a place
or a thing...

256
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,170
...one object or even one person.

257
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,340
She left everything half-way.
A film. A book. A hobby.

258
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,300
Before she turned 25...

259
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,800
...she broke two engagements.

260
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
- Let me kiss you.
- Please go for it.

261
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,540
Be serious!

262
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,980
God had given me so many signs.

263
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,850
But I was too obsessed by Bindu
to ever notice.

264
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,820
Bindu was like that melody...

265
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,900
...that you hear once...

266
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,030
...and can't get out of your head.

267
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,530
1983.

268
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,280
That year Kapil Dev won
the World Cup at Lords.

269
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,240
Kishore-da sang "Taaki o taaki."

270
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,910
And we learned about thunderstorms
In our geography class.

271
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,250
My little thunderstorm came quietly...

272
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,760
...on a boring Tuesday in an old
green Ambassador car.

273
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,020
To welcome our new neighbours,
Ma made mince-meat samosas.

274
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,610
Like all great Indian love stories,
mine too started...

275
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,110
...with samosas and green chutney.

276
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,210
There she was, sitting on
those trunks in the attic.

277
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,180
Fiercely guarding the secrets
they contained.

278
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,850
She had her headphones on,
looking at me with suspicion.

279
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,690
That look!

280
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,230
Oh God, that look.

281
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,570
Finally she said...

282
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,990
Listen to this. This will change
your life.

283
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,830
This will change my life?
What did she mean?

284
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,040
The song? The headphones?
Or she herself?

285
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,670
Even today I feel she had eyes
only for the green chutney.

286
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,880
We wont be able to watch
the show?

287
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,260
This TV has become a pain.

288
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,640
Cricket and film songs always
brought India closer together.

289
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,690
Every Wednesday evening, I had
to battle with the antenna.

290
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,360
- Is it on?
- Yes. Don't move.

291
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,490
Before the 4.10 secs of
"Aaiye Meherbaan" were over...

292
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,640
...Madhubala had Ashok Kumar
swooning over her.

293
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,660
And I had found my best friend.

294
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,220
Come to me, my kind friend.

295
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,690
Take a seat, sweetheart.

296
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,230
I invite you...

297
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
...to take the test of love.

298
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,710
Let the song finish.

299
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,020
It's my name. Bindu.

300
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,110
What kind of name is that?

301
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,240
Bindu Shankarnaraynan. Is that
a name for a rock star?

302
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,240
- Wow! Are you really stripping?
- Eyes on the road.

303
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,490
Do you know why my father
named me "Bindu?"

304
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,540
- You think I care?
- Go on, guess.

305
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,790
After his favourite actress,
Saira Banu.

306
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,670
"My sweet Bindu."

307
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,630
Who names their only daughter...

308
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,840
...after a comic character
in a 70s film?

309
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,380
Why didn't he name me "Saira?"

310
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,880
Such an attractive name.

311
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,100
- My pet name is Bubla.
- Eyes on the road, Bubla.

312
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,350
It sounds like a Bengali version
of "Bubble Wrap."

313
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,690
- I don't even have my own song.
- Bubla really stinks.

314
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,690
But your parents called you
Abhimanyu too.

315
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,820
I'm stuck with this one name.

316
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,860
All my life I will stay a Bindu.

317
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,650
Uncool, unmarried. For life.

318
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,120
Don't worry.
I will marry you.

319
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,620
But you need to improve
your figure first.

320
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,870
You unfit Bengali!

321
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,500
With a name like Bubla,
dreaming about hot girls?

322
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,750
Sorry.

323
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,340
Ok. Bubla is a great name.
I'll marry you.

324
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,510
Are you sure?

325
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,890
But I can't walk. I'm wearing heels.

326
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,550
It's 11.30pm. I promised to give
Rahul my car.

327
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,890
So how are we going
to the party?

328
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,560
It's an emergency.

329
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,810
'That' kind of emergency?

330
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,360
Where is he?

331
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,320
- What are you doing?
- Look away.

332
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,660
What's up, bro?

333
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,580
Hi, Rahul.

334
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,380
How are you? Good?
Very good.

335
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Thanks.

336
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,420
- Have fun.
- Bye.

337
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,680
I need a cab.

338
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,810
- Let's go.
- Where?

339
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,770
Hurry up... follow that car.

340
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,200
I left my keys behind.

341
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,490
You want them now?

342
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,160
It'll take a second.

343
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,830
Where are they? Where?

344
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,330
Oh! Hi, Pinky.

345
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,920
Glowing!

346
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,340
No keys here.

347
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,090
Found them. Thank God.

348
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,140
Follow me.

349
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,730
I can't believe you seriously
did that.

350
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,850
Rahul's face turned bright red.

351
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,650
And what about Miss Pinky Rastogi?

352
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,490
- Now they'll know.
- We'll find a taxi further on.

353
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,070
Bubla...

354
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,750
Don't sulk, Bubble Wrap.

355
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,370
Come.

356
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,540
- Why are you so heavy?
- Know what I like about you?

357
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,510
What?

358
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,430
I am thinking.

359
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,760
I like the way you scrunch up
your nose when you're angry.

360
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,230
I also like those old-fashioned
sweaters you wear in the summer.

361
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,060
- I'll drop you here.
- But, but... I love...

362
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,280
That you're a real gentleman.

363
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,570
You'd never drop a helpless girl
on a cold road.

364
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,490
Never!

365
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,830
You!

366
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,310
The girl from Kolkata.

367
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,110
A Bengali qawali.

368
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,320
Let me sing!

369
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,150
Let it go to hell...

370
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,820
...the material world.

371
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,950
Let me drop by your home
some day.

372
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,620
Leave your window open...

373
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,000
....and let me fly away.

374
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,210
Let me play...

375
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,710
...let joy overcome me.

376
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,440
O lovely girl,
let me get close to you.

377
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,680
Your youth...

378
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,930
...my youth...

379
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,190
...won't let go of me.

380
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,190
I roam streets and lanes...

381
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,360
...come to me, sweetheart.

382
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,240
Fly to me in these pebbled lanes.

383
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,160
Come to me. Let the rumours
spread.

384
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,160
Everyone at home will have
a problem with us.

385
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,790
Let me...

386
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,790
...let you, get ourselves
a bad name.

387
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,790
What is youth worth?

388
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,800
If it isn't full of wicked fun.

389
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,550
We are buddies who meet
at midnight.

390
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,760
Your youth...

391
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,140
...my youth...

392
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,400
...won't let go of me.

393
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,980
Page seven.

394
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,190
Don't.

395
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,740
Who wants page seven?

396
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,040
20 bucks?

397
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,670
Page 3.

398
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,470
Please.

399
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,760
Must we attach the question paper
with the answer sheet?

400
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,310
I'm done.

401
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,400
Me and my crazy neighbour.

402
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,980
Our homes were next to each other,
So were our lives...

403
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,900
...like Gabbar and Sambha. Munna
and Circuit, Guruji and Bhola.

404
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,950
Here. No more renting your car.
No more emergencies.

405
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,160
- Come on.
- You're nuts.

406
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,210
She always managed to make
me do wild and crazy things.

407
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,180
This 'two-phone rings' girl will
trap him one day.

408
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,850
As long as it's a girl.

409
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,320
I have to get some notes
from Prakash.

410
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,530
Where to?

411
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,400
I'll be back.

412
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,320
Bubla!

413
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,410
Just look at him!

414
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,460
Two rings means an emergency.
You know, right?

415
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,040
Everybody in North Kolkata knows.

416
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,050
Ok.

417
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:01,960
Listen...

418
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,800
Bindu, whatever it is,
it's a no.

419
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
You know I don't like dogs.

420
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,690
Someone ran over his mother.

421
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,230
This little guy was crying
on the road.

422
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,230
Pa won't let me keep him.

423
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,030
How can we abandon him
on the streets?

424
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,870
- Know what we must call him?
- Someone else's problem?

425
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,700
We'll call him Devdas.

426
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,580
Can we keep Devdas?

427
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,620
What do I tell Ma?

428
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,380
Instead of notes,
I came back with a dog?

429
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,710
Not a dog. It's Devdas.

430
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,300
No chance. End of discussion.

431
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,050
Then came the big day in the
college calendar.

432
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,980
The Xavier's Annual football match.
Science vs. Commerce.

433
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,600
I'll deal with you later.

434
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,280
These games added new words
to my vocabulary.

435
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,870
Crushes. Rebounds.
Boyfriend, girlfriend...

436
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,780
...good friend, just friend.
It's complicated. Etc, etc.

437
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,960
And I discovered why goalkeepers
hate centre-forwards.

438
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,140
We lost the match badly.

439
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,770
But it felt as though I had
lost something more.

440
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,690
Very helpless, very helpless.

441
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,700
Final score. Life: 2.
Abhimanyu Roy: 0.

442
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,370
Run, run!

443
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,040
Who asked you to lend the car?

444
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,250
Damn! He banged the car.

445
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,420
Who is the idiot driving my car?

446
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,800
Dhruv!

447
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,180
Released the handbrake
by mistake.

448
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,890
Centre-forward.

449
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,470
He's already scored.

450
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,810
It's Bindu.

451
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,980
Cool it, you'll get your money.

452
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,690
You better.

453
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,650
My sweet Bindu.

454
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,730
My innocent Bindu.

455
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,490
Why make out on the front seat?
The back seat...

456
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,320
...has more room.

457
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,200
It's tried and tested.

458
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,330
I could've given you
a crash course.

459
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,800
Your hero is going to pay
for the car.

460
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,430
Abhi?

461
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,830
One word, Hindi.

462
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,710
One word!

463
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,670
Terrific.

464
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,800
Titanic?

465
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,970
Saajan Chale Sasural.

466
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,890
- Swabhimaan.
- It's Na...

467
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,520
Keep quiet.

468
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,690
Yes Boss.

469
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,900
Rangeela.

470
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,940
QSQT.

471
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,200
O Darling, this is India.

472
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,740
Jo Jeeta Wohi SIkander.

473
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,070
Apu Trilogy.

474
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,160
- I'll hit you.
- She was doing well.

475
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,790
You.

476
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,120
One word? Hindi title.

477
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,880
Nagin.

478
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,750
So?

479
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,090
Candles... Candles... Candles...

480
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,180
One second. I'm looking for one.

481
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,180
Stop it, guys.

482
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,070
My melody has blended
with your night.

483
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,400
I have a friend who rents his car
for such emergencies.

484
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,660
You want it?

485
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,370
What just happened...

486
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,500
Like the Christmas lights
on Park Street...

487
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,960
...some strange new feelings
were stirring inside us.

488
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,510
We were still neighbours...

489
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,300
...but our paths were separating.

490
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,140
You guys are a mad lot.

491
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,690
I am trying to write.

492
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,780
You shoot like a sissy!

493
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,910
The referee can't hear you.
Shout louder.

494
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,170
Don't get angry, Bubla.

495
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,130
I am not angry.

496
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,590
They love you so much.

497
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,640
Love is over rated.
I need peace.

498
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,350
Going back to Mumbai?

499
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,970
It's your baba's birthday
in three days.

500
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,730
I'm not going anywhere. I'll come
back. Staying in a hotel.

501
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,270
I'll be back. I need time away from
this madhouse. I'm going nuts.

502
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,940
You'll stay in a hotel?

503
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,900
What will people think? You're
in Kolkata, but not staying at home.

504
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,410
Do what is right.
The book is more important.

505
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,620
- What will you eat?
- It's a hotel, Ma. They'll have food.

506
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,660
Why don't you ever say something?

507
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,250
What can I say? He's grown up
now. He'll do as he pleases.

508
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,360
Two eyes...

509
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,620
...and one story.

510
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,530
This... was my mother's
favourite song.

511
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,990
She used to sing it at night
to put me to sleep.

512
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,170
I never did anything
for my mother.

513
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,880
I thought...

514
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,380
...I would someday...

515
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,960
I'd have enough time.

516
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,010
Enough chances.

517
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,220
I never thought I'd run out of time.

518
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,020
Two eyes...

519
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,280
...and one story.

520
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:55,040
A few scattered clouds,
a few drops of rain.

521
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,920
One story.

522
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,980
After that night, the light never
came on in the attic.

523
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,820
Her father wasn't charged
for drunk driving.

524
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,860
But Bindu never forgave him.

525
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,780
His face kept reminding her
of the accident.

526
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,040
She ran away from home.

527
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,670
To Australia.

528
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,340
To her aunt.

529
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,460
Like most things in her life...

530
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,130
...she left her studies half-way.

531
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,640
Bubla.

532
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,240
My sweet Bindu.

533
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,950
Your father gave me
your address.

534
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,120
Hope this letter reaches you
on time.

535
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,910
Your father is a changed man.

536
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,750
He has stopped drinking.

537
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,590
I don't get the time to go to Kolkata,
but Ma fills me in by phone.

538
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,960
I am in Bangalore, studying
management at IMS.

539
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,420
It's very different out here.

540
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,340
No one shares headphones. They
discuss grades and starting salaries.

541
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,390
I miss you. Send me your number.

542
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,480
I am pretty broke. But I can manage
a long distance call.

543
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,810
Abhimanyu!

544
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,190
Hello, stranger. Yes.

545
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,360
This is me. Life is crazy.
Australia is crazy.

546
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,190
Sending you a postcard, so I don't
have to write a lot.

547
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,030
Who told you to do an MBA?

548
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,660
You write well. You should've
become a writer.

549
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,370
You'd be happier and nap
in the afternoons.

550
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,460
Love and kisses to Devdas.
I miss you too.

551
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,460
In Australia, they call me
Bindaloo!

552
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,590
My name continues to ruin my life.
How are the chicks?

553
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,510
Chicks? You mean girls?

554
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,590
There are two girls in our batch.
They have moustaches.

555
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,140
There's a senior called Manjari.

556
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,970
She wears baggy trousers
and keeps saying s...!

557
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,930
Everyone at IMS is crazy about her.

558
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,350
Before I get interested in boys,
please come back.

559
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,860
My email id: muqqaddarkasikandar
1977@hotmail.com

560
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,320
Love Abhi.

561
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,610
PS. What happened to
front seat Dhruv?

562
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,910
Dhruv? Who?

563
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,580
You know the thing about boys, some
have great eyes, or great noses...

564
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,040
...some have great lips.

565
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,000
A Shah Rukh Khan dialogue.
But the thought is mine.

566
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,370
Hi, Abhi!

567
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,170
In Cal for a week.

568
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,670
My heartless father has found
a suitable boy for me.

569
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,380
What do you say? Should I get
married?

570
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,300
You're getting married?
When? Where?

571
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,510
Congratulations my love!

572
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:02,140
Would have loved to come.
But it's placement week.

573
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,230
Devdas must be singing a sad
song for you.

574
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,980
He's heartbroken.

575
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,570
It's Holi!

576
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,820
My sweet Bindu...

577
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,110
Ma said you ran away
from your engagement.

578
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:14,450
Slow clap.

579
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,910
Ma also said how much money
your father lost.

580
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,410
Taking music seriously?
Amazing news.

581
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,950
I'm moving to Mumbai, Analytic
Division at a bank.

582
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,370
Write more often.

583
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:29,130
Hello, hi. Bonjour! I am in Paris
with my hopeless band.

584
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,340
I don't get a word of what
the boys say here.

585
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,550
Maybe that's why I find them
so hot.

586
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,470
My sweet Bindu. I hope all is well.
Happy Diwali.

587
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,930
Happy birthday, Abhi.
Love, B.

588
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,890
My sweet Bindu.
I hope all is good with you.

589
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,440
I've started working. My job
has taken Ma's place.

590
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,400
Never leaves me alone for a minute.

591
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,940
I have to work real hard.
And zero money.

592
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,320
I'll write on Saturday.

593
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,820
That Saturday I did not write to her.

594
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,200
Nor on the following Saturday.

595
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:01,990
Days and years disappeared
in a blink of an eye.

596
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,370
I was lost in the embrace
of Mumbai, this crazy city.

597
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,280
Can you fix this, Alok-da?

598
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,780
Oh goodness me! It's Abhimanyu.

599
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,320
You vanished after college.

600
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,040
Days of the cassette are over.

601
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,580
They're dinosaurs now.

602
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,710
What about some popular MP3's?

603
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,630
Nothing can match the songs
on this cassette.

604
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,340
Full emotion?

605
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,310
What a song!

606
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,060
RD Burman and Gulzar.

607
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,610
OP Nayyar and Asha.

608
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,190
Kishore Kumar and Rajesh Khanna.

609
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,610
There are some combinations...

610
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,620
...that work so well together.

611
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,250
Wonderful on their own,
but miraculous together.

612
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,500
Pure magic!

613
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,420
Keep this carefully.

614
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,130
Combinations like these are rare.

615
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,060
Goa. Candolim. Four years later.

616
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,060
As usual, without warning...

617
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:55,110
...accompanied by
a Burman Saab tune...

618
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,990
...she exploded into my life
once again.

619
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,110
I bet 500 rupees, you're breaking up
with Maulshree.

620
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,660
Shut up!

621
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,910
Where are Vinay and Maulshree?

622
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,240
Maybe at the Chemist's.

623
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,580
Chemist? You are getting
lucky tonight, man.

624
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,500
But after that, you're going
to break up. I'm just saying.

625
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,680
Hold this.

626
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,310
Bindu! Stop the bus!

627
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,440
Stop the bus.

628
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,410
Drive fast.

629
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:50,870
Bindu!

630
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,000
O princess of my dreams,
when will you come to me?

631
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:59,170
The season of love is here,
when will you come to me?

632
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,170
Our lives will pass us by,
when will you come to me?

633
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,430
You could've hopped onto that bus.

634
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,060
It was so crowded.
We couldn't talk.

635
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,060
I'm seeing you like what...
after four years?

636
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,320
Remember my 500 rupees.
And a full tank.

637
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,480
Mind your own business.
I'll fill your tank.

638
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,780
Where are you nowadays?

639
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,410
Near you.

640
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,370
Mumbai!

641
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,040
- What are you saying?
- Yeah, it's been two months.

642
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:33,330
I'm still trying my luck
at singing.

643
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,920
And you must be researching
something boring at your bank.

644
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,630
Research is a useful thing,
sweetheart.

645
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,550
Research says 82% of people who
randomly meet in Goa fall in love.

646
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,510
Is that so?

647
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,600
Listen...

648
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:52,600
I know that your dream was to
have a beach wedding in Goa.

649
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,600
Let's stop right here
and get married.

650
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,310
Terrific idea but I am engaged.

651
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,150
Still don't lose hope.

652
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,990
I've run away from two engagements
before. One veg, one non veg.

653
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,960
You must be considered a goddess
by the catering industry.

654
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,240
Not running this time?

655
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,620
My family and friends
have placed bets.

656
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,500
But not this time.

657
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,170
I really like him.

658
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,420
- What caste is he?
- How does it matter, uncle?

659
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,210
Caste, race, colour, religion.
Mind your own business.

660
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,970
He's a South Indian Christian.
Anil Matthew.

661
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,840
- Star sign?
- Cancerian.

662
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,850
- I am Cancer too.
- You're blood cancer.

663
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,890
You've lost out, my boy.

664
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,270
- Thank you for the bike ride, uncle.
- You can ride it now.

665
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,860
It was crazy meeting you like this.

666
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:48,990
I know.

667
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,780
Look after yourself. And come
to my wedding if you can.

668
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,660
You too, uncle.

669
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,750
I'll be in Mumbai. Take
my number. Call me.

670
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,330
Give me a pen.

671
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,880
Girls like Bindu Shankarnaraynan
are trouble.

672
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,430
You never know when they will
go to your head like a Tequila shot.

673
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,010
I've got to go. Bye, uncle.

674
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,020
Friends warned me...

675
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,860
...loving a girl like her
is freefalling.

676
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,110
No one knows
where you will land...

677
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,320
...and in how many pieces.

678
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,030
- Here's your pen.
- At least hang onto that.

679
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,940
God bless you!

680
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,050
But no one had warned me...

681
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,470
...despite all the suffering
in love...

682
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,470
...you're ready to do it again.

683
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,520
To give love another shot.

684
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,940
Many teach you how to love...

685
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:13,370
...alas, no one teaches you
how to forget that love.

686
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,510
2005.

687
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,950
That year the floods nearly
drowned Mumbai.

688
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:55,740
Gulzar Saab wrote a song about
Aishwarya's dark eyes.

689
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,370
...and Bindu and I landed up
in the same city.

690
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,660
Call it life or Newton's Law of
Gravity...

691
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,790
Things were on a collision course.

692
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,750
I'm starving!

693
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,390
Hello.

694
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,060
Abhi! Where were you?
Have been trying to reach you.

695
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,180
It's an emergency.
Can you come to the bar?

696
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,150
- Now?
- Yes! Now!

697
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,980
Hurry! Don't waste time.

698
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,080
Abhi!

699
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,090
Are we checking out
your competition?

700
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,880
Disco 82.

701
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,590
My tummy's growling.

702
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,010
That wicked scoundrel.

703
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,770
It wasn't me.

704
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,810
Two kebabs and two beers.

705
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,310
Give me that.

706
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,150
- He's run off. That rascal.
- Who?

707
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,990
That South Indian guy?
Mr Matthew?

708
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,860
This time he dumped you.

709
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,910
Sorry.

710
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:26,160
He called Pa. And sent me
a stupid SMS.

711
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,000
I really liked this one. The idiot
dumped me.

712
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,420
Why do these guys agree
to marry you?

713
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,420
They should know your track record.
You're the runner.

714
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,340
- But aren't I hot?
- Sure.

715
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,760
- I sing well?
- True.

716
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:41,970
What else do you want?

717
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,140
Sure, I'm a little insensitive.

718
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:46,140
A little impaitent, insecure.

719
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,730
Sometimes I'm out of control,
only sometimes.

720
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,560
But everyone makes mistakes.

721
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,690
Correct. Nobody's perfect.

722
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,480
You eat first.

723
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,580
Girlfriend?

724
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,240
You want to go, go.

725
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:10,580
Everyone marries. So why not
I play housewife too?

726
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,460
But when the day comes near...

727
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,920
...I start feeling claustrophobic...

728
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,140
This one was a terrific guy.

729
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,640
S...! Why did he run?
The damn Cancerian.

730
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,160
We watched Big Boss together.
Then she fell asleep.

731
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,290
She didn't even eat.

732
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,290
- Something came up.
- Of course!

733
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,920
My sweet... Your sweet Bindu.

734
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,680
This won't end well. You won't
have either her or Bindu.

735
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:05,720
The last time you spoke to a girl
Indira Gandhi was PM.

736
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,770
- What do you know about girls?
- Of course.

737
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,850
I'll make it upto her. Long drive,
foot massage.

738
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,600
- Big Boss, episode no. 27.
- What?

739
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,480
Tomorrow night I'll be watching
Ep. 27 with her.

740
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,900
Want a bet?

741
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,150
- Get the cash from an ATM.
- It's on!

742
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,410
Take her away. Where will I sleep?

743
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,790
He doesn't love you.

744
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,500
Why? I'll get married.
Any problem?

745
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,010
Of course renting to a single girl
in Mumbai is an offence.

746
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,420
Didn't you know that?

747
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,700
What kind of estate agent
are you, Sameer bhai?

748
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,220
Forget the flat. Find me a husband.

749
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,970
Ok. Bye.

750
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,810
- Hi.
- Hi.

751
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,020
- You lost the Juhu flat too?
- That's right.

752
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,270
It's not the end of the world...

753
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,030
...stay with your Mr Matthew
for a few days more.

754
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,070
I don't know how to swim.

755
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,820
I'll fall.

756
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,910
Phone... Boss is calling.

757
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,910
Hello, sir. Of course, sir.

758
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,790
My aunt is feeling much better, sir.

759
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,460
She's even smiling a bit.

760
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,130
I'll see you at the office.
By three?

761
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,590
Four, sir. Sure, sir.
Ok, sir.

762
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,090
What a crazy city!

763
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,470
I should go back to Kolkata.

764
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,600
If I didn't want to be a singer
I would be gone by now.

765
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,560
So when will you be the next
Indian Idol?

766
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,440
To hell with that!

767
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,150
Film composers tell me my voice
needs "special training."

768
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,480
"Come home some time."

769
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:48,370
If your time-pass girlfriend wasn't
staying with you, I would.

770
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,160
Earlier we were neighbours, now
you'll sneak into my home?

771
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,250
When postal codes change, then
friends become like family.

772
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:58,830
- Thought of the day! Thank you.
- Wow.

773
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,210
Why not try "dubbing"?

774
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,720
Till you make it as a singer,
try dubbing.

775
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:07,630
Never know.

776
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,720
Good option, no?

777
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:12,850
Hi, Sameer bhai?

778
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:17,190
I have seen the face
of the moon.

779
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,860
I have seen a sky full of stars.

780
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,360
But I have seen
no one quite like you.

781
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,320
Husband? Or a flat?

782
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,240
In your lovely eyes...

783
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,080
...that's where I want to drown.

784
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,840
No one can stop me
from falling in love.

785
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:46,380
My heart is lost to me.

786
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,680
You lost!

787
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,810
You have won my heart.

788
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,490
A recipe for aubergine "bharta."

789
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,490
Read it in your own style.

790
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,790
First take the aubergine...

791
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:22,630
...and roast it.

792
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:26,960
Then for five minutes...

793
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,050
...stir it.

794
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:34,050
Then play with it for a bit.

795
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:36,810
And then...

796
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:38,850
...roast it again.

797
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,560
Opened-eyes I saw you...

798
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,150
...you're a beautiful dream.

799
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,190
Rakhi Sawant is out of the house!

800
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,530
You are the sweetness...

801
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,320
...filling my heart.

802
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:12,380
Your lovely name...

803
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,680
So I found a way to bribe life...

804
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,600
...and stumbled from friendship
into love.

805
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,150
But first it was time for
the elimination round.

806
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,190
It's the finale.

807
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,000
I'm leaving you.

808
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:45,960
Why?

809
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,460
Please. Let her go.
It's the finale.

810
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:56,180
I really am leaving.

811
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,100
Listen...

812
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,100
Please. Let her go.

813
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,060
Oh yes!

814
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,440
He won!

815
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,370
You were dumped too.

816
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,750
How come, Bubla Roy?

817
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,340
Isn't it strange?

818
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,170
We went our separate ways...

819
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,220
...lived in different cities,
had different careers.

820
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,890
Today we're together again.

821
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,390
11.30pm. Sitting on Mumbai's
Marine Drive, we're chilling out.

822
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,310
The only thing missing is our dog.

823
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,940
You, me and our dog
Devdas.

824
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,940
I like the sound of it.

825
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,660
So you'll exploit me
on the rebound?

826
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,290
Unbelievable.

827
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,370
Do you remember my house attic?

828
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,080
Of course I remember.

829
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,840
Whenever I was very sad
or very happy...

830
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,050
...I would go and hide there.

831
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,600
You'll always be my attic.

832
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,640
Please start paying the rent.

833
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,360
This song is dedicated to...

834
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:36,240
...Abhimanyu Roy and Bindu
Shankarnarayanan.

835
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:40,320
And to all those lonely boys
and girls in this mad city...

836
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,080
...whose hearts have been broken.

837
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,460
I can remember...

838
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,710
...your love.

839
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,730
Where am I? Where are you?
Where have you gone?

840
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,030
Come to me now.

841
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:32,540
"Is it the night, or your black
flowing hair...

842
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:34,670
Beautiful!

843
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,010
Stop your midnight poetry!

844
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,380
Nobody's talking to you.
You fool!

845
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,220
"Or is it the moonlight...?"

846
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,390
Give Javed Akhtar a break!

847
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,770
You know my Hindi is shaky.

848
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,640
It's not Hindi anyway
it's Urdu.

849
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,940
"Is this the moon...?"
Something, something.

850
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:55,860
What did Mr Bachchan sing?

851
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:01,450
"Where have we reached...

852
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,870
- ...walking side by side?"
- Shut up!

853
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,710
I must tell her what I feel
about her.

854
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,000
She already knows.

855
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,250
Everybody knows, even people
who don't know you, know.

856
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:20,340
I must tell her.
I love her so much.

857
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,050
You just want to have fun.

858
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,050
Are you mad?

859
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:29,310
It's true love. I've loved her since
I was a kid. My first crush.

860
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,600
It's only attraction. That's ok.

861
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,730
How do you spell love?

862
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,610
Attraction.

863
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,990
You threw my shoe.

864
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,280
We'll get it later.

865
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,620
Tomorrow morning...

866
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,500
...give her some flowers,
and propose to her.

867
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,830
From the time I couldn't spell
"love," let alone understand it...

868
01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:01,630
...I loved her. When that girl says
yes, I could feel my heart bursting.

869
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,850
I rewound that moment and played
it again and again in my head.

870
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:11,060
Magical. Dim lighting.
Beautiful dresses.

871
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,270
With violins playing like they do
in romantic films.

872
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,110
But this was my love story.

873
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:21,190
Ok, tell me...

874
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,610
...what's 3 Down...

875
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,580
Arabic preparation for grilled meat.
8 letters, one word.

876
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,460
8 letters? Shawarma.

877
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,880
"In the shower," in Gujarati.

878
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,750
- Oh God!
- Last one.

879
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,590
5 Down, 7 Across.

880
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,920
English phrase to explain an
irrational fondness for someone...

881
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,180
...without any rhyme, reason
or context...

882
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,970
...often used as a pretext
to make out.

883
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,100
Three words starts with "I."

884
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,770
That's the clue?

885
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,610
- Check it.
- Really?

886
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:04,240
I love you?

887
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,530
You too! Same here.

888
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,280
Let's get married tomorrow.

889
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,740
- Chinese cuisine. In a church.
- Shut up!

890
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:14,330
Let's go for it.

891
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,870
One minute.

892
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:19,170
Abhimanyu Roy.

893
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,880
Were you proposing to me?

894
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:25,880
Bindu Shankarnaraynan.

895
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,970
5 Down, 7 Across.

896
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,140
Is that it?

897
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:35,810
This is a life-changing moment.

898
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,940
People work hard at it,
they plan...

899
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,860
Hello! I worked hard too.

900
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,030
Research says 70% of relationships
starting in friendship...

901
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,490
...last the longest.

902
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,490
82% of best friends marry
and live happily after ever.

903
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,910
And 22% believe Shah Rukh Khan
when he says...

904
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,740
...in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai
that friendship is love.

905
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,910
Please say something.

906
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,920
Your Mom looks hot in red.

907
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,340
Why are we talking about Mom?

908
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,920
Bubla!

909
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,760
Ma! Baba.

910
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:12,550
See we brought your
favourite biryani.

911
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,930
Please come in. Wait!

912
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,640
The room stinks of insect spray.

913
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,180
Give me two minutes.

914
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:18,940
Careful.

915
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,770
We've had it. Please go
and deal with them.

916
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,650
Get up, you guys.

917
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,950
Get what's-her-name up!

918
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,660
Go. Clean the mess, please.

919
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,370
Get up! My folks are here.

920
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,760
What is it?

921
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,430
Clean that corner.

922
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,970
Pick up all those bottles.

923
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:55,680
Go back to sleep, moron.

924
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,350
Who the hell are you?

925
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,530
Bindu?

926
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,610
What are you doing these days?

927
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:13,620
Dubbing.

928
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:14,910
Are you singing?

929
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:18,330
No, aunty. I'm doing voice-overs
in Tamil films.

930
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,750
It's very comfortable.
Gives you maximum pleasure!

931
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,760
Go, go, go. Grab it now!

932
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,680
Do they pay you?

933
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:35,510
Not much. But you know
Pa is rich.

934
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:37,680
He sends me money every month.

935
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,100
Atonement. For killing my mother.

936
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:46,150
So, you've been in touch with Abhi
all these years?

937
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:50,320
- That's quite sweet, Bindu.
- That's very sweet.

938
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,120
The room is messy.

939
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,790
They work with me at the bank.
Credit card department.

940
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,140
Bro.

941
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:19,850
Sit.

942
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,110
I better go.

943
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,030
Bye, uncle.

944
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,110
Aunty.

945
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,610
Credit card Dept.

946
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,040
I'll be right back.

947
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,080
I love teasing your mother.

948
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,830
Forget Ma. What about us?

949
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,590
- What?
- Give me your answer.

950
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,720
Or else millions of Bengali boys
like me won't forgive you.

951
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,550
They'll curse you.

952
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,850
Just those three words
that I'm dying to hear.

953
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,560
"Do, fight, win."

954
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,140
- Shut up!
- 5 Down, 7 Across.

955
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,480
I'll kill you.

956
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,530
Abhimanyu Bubla Roy.

957
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,240
I love you.

958
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,880
- Say it without the "Bubla."
- Yeah, right.

959
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,320
Tiny little drops of love.

960
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,990
Like a sweet drink.

961
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,450
Slowly love grows and grows.

962
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,290
A little naive.

963
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,040
A little naughty.

964
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,380
Softly a habit grows and grows.

965
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,720
When we are face to face...

966
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,050
...what can I do?

967
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,850
I just can't believe it.

968
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,100
From dawn to dusk...

969
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,860
...I seek you.

970
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,690
I cannot stop myself.

971
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:42,490
This love is intoxicating.

972
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:46,910
Our love is intoxicating.

973
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,460
This love is intoxicating.

974
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:57,880
Our love is intoxicating.

975
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:01,300
Now you see,
what I do to you.

976
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,970
- I've got an idea.
- No.

977
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,930
- Let's make a tape.
- No.

978
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,730
Listen! Let's make a mixed tape.

979
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:15,230
The best of our lives. Our story
told through film songs.

980
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,650
The soundtrack of our lives.

981
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:20,240
Like our favourite songs?

982
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,450
Not necessarily. But they must
be linked to our lives.

983
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:24,910
There are so many beautiful songs.

984
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,120
Sad songs, rubbish songs.
Our songs.

985
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,370
- Like our dirty secret?
- Exactly.

986
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:33,670
- Just tape them back to back.
- Ten for me, ten for you.

987
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,540
Side B should have
5 mins blank at the end.

988
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,800
We keep a space for the last song.

989
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,630
I love the idea! Let's do this.

990
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,680
I'll eat you up.

991
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,220
I melt a little.

992
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,640
I slip a little.

993
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,810
I stumble a little...

994
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:54,560
...and fall into your arms.

995
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,020
I slide a little.

996
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:59,440
I slip a little.

997
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,320
Sometimes I change my mind
for no reason.

998
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:09,240
Distance between us from now.

999
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:15,330
I feel spring become
one with my breath.

1000
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:19,880
We meet on every path.

1001
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,180
We exchange glances.

1002
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:32,060
This love is intoxicating.

1003
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:36,150
Our love is intoxicating.

1004
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,780
Get out of here.
- Abhi!

1005
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,870
This intoxication may give me
a hangover.

1006
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:57,880
Our love is intoxicating.

1007
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,170
You are a devil!

1008
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,880
You'll go to hell.

1009
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,500
So you like this fellow?

1010
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,130
Does he live with you?

1011
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,180
He wishes.

1012
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,230
What would you say
to Ma if she were alive?

1013
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,280
To your mother?

1014
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,450
"Sorry." I guess.

1015
01:15:57,370 --> 01:16:00,460
I am sorry I couldn't
make her happy.

1016
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,960
I am sorry I was drunk that night.

1017
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:10,180
The car, I didn't even see it turn.

1018
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:15,760
If there was one thing I could
change in life...

1019
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:19,350
...it would be to make her happy.

1020
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,650
My child...

1021
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,150
I'm sorry.

1022
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:57,560
Hey Banker!

1023
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,640
Why are you crying?

1024
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,270
The valiant hero finally persuaded
the heroine's cruel father.

1025
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:13,450
And they all lived happily ever after.

1026
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,290
But nobody said there's so much
more beyond 'happily ever after.'

1027
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:29,500
Listen sometime,
your heart says things.

1028
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:34,510
Come spread your wings.

1029
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:39,720
Life is whispering in your ears.

1030
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,770
Come spread your wings.

1031
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:48,190
Open your arms wide.

1032
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,480
With your arms wide open...

1033
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:55,450
Slowly now, teach yourself
how to love.

1034
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,870
Breathe freely, breathe deeply.

1035
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:05,790
Slowly now, teach yourself
how to smile.

1036
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,840
Sometimes float with the clouds...

1037
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,340
...in the open sky.

1038
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,970
What are you scared of?

1039
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,700
Listen sometime,
your heart says things.

1040
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:46,790
Listen sometime,
your heart says things.

1041
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,340
Can't you hear the sky
is calling you.

1042
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:00,640
All the things you want to forget
that cause pain.

1043
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:03,350
Let them fly away too.

1044
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,480
Listen sometime,
your heart says things.

1045
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:17,820
Come spread your wings.

1046
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,660
Open your arms wide.

1047
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:24,540
With your arms wide open...

1048
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,080
Slowly now, teach yourself
how to love.

1049
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,610
Sorry, I got late. Come let's go.

1050
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,740
Om Shanti Om. Two tickets
10.30 show.

1051
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,030
Not in the mood.

1052
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,370
Drink up. Your mood will change.
Come.

1053
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,700
Here.

1054
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:07,580
Come on!

1055
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,670
What's wrong?

1056
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,920
Do I need your permission
to go to the loo?

1057
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:15,250
What's come over you?

1058
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,670
Can I go first?
It's an emergency.

1059
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,550
This is an emergency too!

1060
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:24,300
Are you nuts?

1061
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,310
We can't keep Om and Shanti waiting.
We're getting late.

1062
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:31,690
Not everything is a joke, Abhi.

1063
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,560
Ok. Tell me what's happened?

1064
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:36,900
Don't you know?

1065
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,570
Oh God! Not again.

1066
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:42,860
Try and forget about
your album, please.

1067
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,160
Abhi, you don't get it.

1068
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,700
Just go. Abhi, stop it!

1069
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,580
There's more to life than music.

1070
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,590
Listen to me.

1071
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,960
Excuse me.

1072
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,300
I'm sorry.

1073
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,470
Bindu, I love you.
The rest doesn't matter.

1074
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:06,220
I love you, too, Abhi.

1075
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,430
I see a whole lifetime
ahead of me.

1076
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,600
Nothing excites me.

1077
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:15,270
I myself don't know what I want.
That's scary.

1078
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:21,440
- What are you doing?
- Ok. Time out.

1079
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:24,070
Now tell me.

1080
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:26,410
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

1081
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,540
Fine. I'll go first.

1082
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,500
Married. Devdas.

1083
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:34,290
2 bed flat in Matunga.

1084
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:38,420
Two kids. We'll take them for
football practice every Saturday.

1085
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:39,880
Your turn.

1086
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,420
I saw myself somewhere, Abhi.

1087
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,510
On TV, on album covers.

1088
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,100
On a stage somewhere in Argentina,
or BKC or Mussoorie.

1089
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,560
Singing in front of thousands.

1090
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:53,180
I don't know about the rest.

1091
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,650
Bindu, listen!

1092
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,030
Jeet, Vinay let it be.

1093
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,610
Baba, stop!

1094
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:06,740
Forget it guys.

1095
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,410
This will change your life.

1096
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:27,970
My sweet Bindu.

1097
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,510
My innocent Bindu.

1098
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,180
My Bindu on my brow.

1099
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,940
My love boat is in a whirlpool...

1100
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:39,150
...help it reach the shore.

1101
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,990
Put your arms around my neck...

1102
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,160
...like a garland of flowers.

1103
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,080
Let's swing on a love swing.

1104
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,840
Hurry and come to me...

1105
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:10,140
...and brighten this dark life
of mine.

1106
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,850
Brighten my life.

1107
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,230
My Bindu.

1108
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:26,950
So sweet.

1109
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:41,840
Congrats Abhi.

1110
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,820
What a day! This is not
how it played out in my head.

1111
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,240
Never mind.

1112
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:10,990
All that choreography,
six months' planning.

1113
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:13,200
Your Dad, my Mom.

1114
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:16,700
You should've seen the rehearsal
videos. They were hilarious.

1115
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,870
Look at their faces.

1116
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,330
Baba is sleeping with his mouth open.

1117
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,300
Bindu.

1118
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:30,220
Still mad, are you?

1119
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,800
No.

1120
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,890
Your Mom made me wear it.
What does she have against me?

1121
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:41,140
It's 200 years old. It belonged
to my great-grandmother.

1122
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,810
Since I was 12...

1123
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:45,900
...Ma has been looking for
someone who'll wear it.

1124
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,570
I don't know, Abhi.

1125
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:57,700
For a while I thought I could go
along with your plans for us.

1126
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:00,960
I'll sing...

1127
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:05,130
...you'll do your 9 to 5 job,
we'll be happy.

1128
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,210
But...

1129
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,670
But, what?

1130
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,260
But...

1131
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,640
Speak up.

1132
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,890
It doesn't make me happy.

1133
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,770
I don't know how to explain it.

1134
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,980
No, my parents are here...

1135
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,650
...your Dad is here.

1136
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:31,190
What was the point of all this?

1137
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:34,950
I am sorry.

1138
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,910
Sorry for what?

1139
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,160
You could've discussed it
with me.

1140
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,540
How do you expect
an honest answer...

1141
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,630
...when there is so much
expectation...

1142
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,380
Stop thinking about what I want.

1143
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,470
What your Dad wants.
What my parents want.

1144
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,640
We never mattered before.
Why think of us now?

1145
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,430
The question is...
what do you want?

1146
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,680
- It's not that simple.
- Goddammit. What do you want?

1147
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:13,490
I can't do this, Abhi.

1148
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:18,330
It's too much.

1149
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,700
I can't deal with this.

1150
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:25,210
How can I explain it?

1151
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,630
This is too heavy. I feel suffocated.

1152
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,300
Bindu left for Bangalore.

1153
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:16,470
She needed some quiet
time to think.

1154
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:20,470
She called that night...

1155
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,260
...I didn't pick up.

1156
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,810
For months she emailed,
messaged and called.

1157
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:32,360
"I am sorry. Talk to me.

1158
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,730
"Everything happened so fast.
The time was wrong.

1159
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,200
"I am trying to find myself.
I am really sorry.

1160
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:41,200
"Won't you forgive me, Bubble Wrap?"
Etc, etc.

1161
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,790
I remember every comma,
every fullstop.

1162
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:50,580
I felt every emotion hidden
behind her words.

1163
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:55,420
Call it anger, ego or something
else...

1164
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,550
...I didn't answer her.

1165
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,050
Perhaps there was nothing
left to say.

1166
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:09,310
She stopped writing after
203 emails.

1167
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:12,900
Chapter closed.

1168
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:22,570
Then one day I decided
to move on.

1169
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:24,780
Quit my job...

1170
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:28,910
...and landed up in the world
of Hindi pulp publishers.

1171
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,710
Mr Roy, you're trying too hard.

1172
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,670
Don't copy Gulzar.
It's beyond you.

1173
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:40,180
Don't try to be deep.

1174
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:42,590
What I liked...

1175
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:45,640
...was the horror section
in the middle. Pathbreaking!

1176
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:47,970
Bravo! You had me.

1177
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,810
"The Witch's Slipper." Bravo!

1178
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:54,860
Sir, just change the title
from "Slipper" to "Blouse."

1179
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:56,860
Add some heat.

1180
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:02,160
Sir, that's the answer
to all problems.

1181
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:03,700
Life's solution, sir.

1182
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:05,870
The one time you don't have
to ask...

1183
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,000
...whether you're dressed right
for the occasion. Right?

1184
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,920
Just this tag line...

1185
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:16,340
"Who is behind the blouse?"

1186
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,880
Get it?

1187
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:21,800
No, no. This is it.

1188
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,800
Crack it open, sir!

1189
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,510
Enter the dark side.

1190
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,270
Come...

1191
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,980
...to the dark side.

1192
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,820
- Nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

1193
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,950
17 December 2009.

1194
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,200
My first book "The Witch's Blouse"
was published.

1195
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:49,240
Many called congratulating me.

1196
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:54,540
Coincidentally that day
I got another call.

1197
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,130
Hello?

1198
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,470
Abhimanyu Roy?

1199
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:13,730
Bindu Shankarnaraynan.

1200
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:19,320
From an unknown number.

1201
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,940
At least you answered.

1202
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:24,030
Two years later.

1203
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,200
Finally.

1204
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:29,120
112 long distance calls.

1205
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:32,870
Eight local calls.
Twenty-three letters.

1206
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:37,420
I met your mother in Kolkata
twice.

1207
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,760
I felt terrible when you
didn't reply.

1208
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,220
But I felt worse...

1209
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,100
...when I realised you were
right not to.

1210
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,980
I felt...

1211
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,780
How are you?

1212
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,320
I'm good.

1213
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:17,670
Abhi, I really had to talk to you.

1214
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,750
Why?

1215
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:24,340
You see...

1216
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:33,100
I'm getting married.

1217
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:36,560
At the end of the month.
In Bangalore.

1218
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:48,320
Abhi?

1219
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:51,780
Yes?

1220
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:56,500
Nothing.

1221
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,920
I know you won't come...

1222
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:04,750
...but I figured I should do
one thing right.

1223
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,340
I know I'm being selfish.

1224
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:09,970
But how could I marry
without telling you?

1225
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,470
I'm happy for you.

1226
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,190
Ok. I'm hanging up.

1227
01:32:58,430 --> 01:33:02,850
I know that you are now
a stranger to me...

1228
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,440
...but still...

1229
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:09,900
...sometimes this thought
crosses my mind...

1230
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,240
Carrom is beyond you.

1231
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,870
Must I always open the door?

1232
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,420
Mitra!

1233
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:26,840
Bubla?

1234
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:32,970
The hotel was too costly.
100rs for mineral water.

1235
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:34,640
Yes! We were also missing you.

1236
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:37,680
But you're too late...

1237
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,560
...I've polished off
all the sweets.

1238
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:42,770
Come, play Carrom with us.

1239
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:49,440
Move over! The champion is here.

1240
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,110
Now starts the Carrom board
horror show.

1241
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:11,550
Thank you.

1242
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,140
Looks like these walls
might collapse anytime.

1243
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:19,060
You must have lunch with us.

1244
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:28,860
You shifting?

1245
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,280
No!

1246
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:32,690
Just taking the furniture
for a picnic.

1247
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:35,280
They got bored sitting at home.

1248
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:37,820
I'm finally selling the house.

1249
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:40,160
No strength to look after it
any more.

1250
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:43,120
They'll soon build
a high-rise here.

1251
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,290
I'll stay with Anita.

1252
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,620
Aunt Anita?

1253
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,290
Why not stay with Bindu?

1254
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:52,630
I've never understood
you two.

1255
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:55,130
Nor have I understood
you two.

1256
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:59,890
Bindu's bicycle.

1257
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,810
You know I got it for her
when she was 5 years old.

1258
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:06,390
And the dent. I crashed it
against the lamp post.

1259
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,270
I got hurt. She didn't.

1260
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:16,360
One of you had to get hurt
some day.

1261
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,330
Abhi!

1262
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,330
Stop!

1263
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:32,840
Abhi, wait!

1264
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:36,300
I'll complain to your mother.

1265
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:40,680
My pants will split.
Stop there!

1266
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:46,100
Chat later. Get on with the work.

1267
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:59,530
Pack all the furniture.

1268
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:24,220
Electrician!

1269
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,350
Where's that electrician gone?

1270
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:29,270
Where are you going, Bubla?

1271
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:16,730
Hi.

1272
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:21,150
What's your name?

1273
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:24,700
I'm very hungry.

1274
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:26,790
Shall I eat your finger?

1275
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,000
You have five.

1276
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:32,790
Please.

1277
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,590
Just the little one,
it's yummy.

1278
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,500
- No!
- Kaanchi.

1279
01:38:05,870 --> 01:38:06,910
Made friends?

1280
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:11,000
Give us time. I tend to
grow on people.

1281
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:22,420
I forgot. What was our
emergency code?

1282
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:24,880
Two, or three rings?

1283
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:30,520
Everything was an emergency
to you.

1284
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,640
There was no other code.

1285
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,780
Pa told me you were here.

1286
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,740
So finally Major will live with you?

1287
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:45,490
I know.

1288
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:48,530
We'll soon be at each other's throats.

1289
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:55,290
I wanted Kaanchi to see
our old house.

1290
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:58,960
Kaanchi? Like in the song?

1291
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,840
So?

1292
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:03,470
Actually she's called
Kanchan in the song.

1293
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,620
Know how long I have
waited for this moment?

1294
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,990
A revenge song plays...

1295
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,910
...trembling you say:
"Forgive me, master.

1296
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:37,670
"I made a mistake."

1297
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,550
So you became a best-selling
writer after all?

1298
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,970
I should've waited a bit longer.

1299
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:53,930
- Have you read my books?
- Are you nuts?

1300
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:57,480
Can't even read 4 pages of
the "Bangalore Times."

1301
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:03,820
But...

1302
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,780
...on the book cover
I read...

1303
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:10,370
"The Wild Washerwoman"
will wash you away.

1304
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:13,080
So how could I resist?

1305
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:16,910
- What was the other one?
- I won't tell you.

1306
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:20,290
"Tricycle." It'll puncture
your life.

1307
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,000
Yuck!

1308
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:30,050
Abhi, where are you?

1309
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,760
When are we cutting the cake?

1310
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,430
Rohit Ved Prakash, sir.

1311
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:36,100
I've come to collect
Abhi's manuscript.

1312
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:37,850
Abhi? Who knows where he is.

1313
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:41,230
But I have to tell you...

1314
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,360
...your novels are
super entertaining.

1315
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:46,740
No matter what. You had to
become a writer.

1316
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:50,490
Horror is easy.

1317
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:55,200
I've been trying to finish
a love story for 3 years.

1318
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:03,920
I am sure it's difficult.

1319
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:08,010
What new is there to say
about love?

1320
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:14,100
You'll find a new angle for sure,
Bubla Roy.

1321
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,640
I know you that much.

1322
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:21,980
You must finish it.

1323
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:26,820
You'll have a hundred hits,
like Sachin.

1324
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:32,700
Made a century.
But lost the match.

1325
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:40,290
You advising me now?

1326
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:43,630
You have never completed
anything in life.

1327
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,920
You should see me as a Mom.

1328
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,680
I surprise myself sometimes.

1329
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:53,510
I love it.

1330
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,180
Bubla, this is the one thing
I'm not a disaster at.

1331
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,900
Wait here.

1332
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,410
Hello, hello.

1333
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,250
Have you something
against my staircase?

1334
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,960
It's such romantic weather.

1335
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:29,250
Look at him gobble the cake.

1336
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:36,800
Abhi! The manuscript will get
drenched. And I'll drown.

1337
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:38,810
Ruined my cake too.

1338
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:50,610
Just read.

1339
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,950
So many pages? It must
be pretty sentimental.

1340
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:56,660
Not another word. Read it.

1341
01:42:57,870 --> 01:43:01,290
Taking your revenge? Why not
play the revenge song too?

1342
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,880
Where did you find that?

1343
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:16,680
Don't go away. Don't leave me now...

1344
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:23,430
...my heart hasn't
had its fill of you.

1345
01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:42,240
You have only just arrived.

1346
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:46,410
As beautiful as the Spring.

1347
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:49,500
Enjoy the fragrant air...

1348
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,480
Bindu. In one word...

1349
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:09,850
My neighbour, my best friend.

1350
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:13,320
You and me, music playing
in the background.

1351
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:16,780
Many teach you how to love...

1352
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:19,280
...alas no one teaches you...

1353
01:44:20,490 --> 01:44:22,410
...how to forget that love.

1354
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:46,310
Bindu.

1355
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:50,150
Without her, I could never
be complete.

1356
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,190
She was better than
a half-smoked cigarette.

1357
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:55,820
Better than hot tea
in the cold rain.

1358
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:59,740
More heartbreaking than the
last 10 minutes of the film "Anand."

1359
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,950
Better than Zakir Hussain's tabla...

1360
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:04,910
...Sachin Tendulkar's
straight drive.

1361
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,460
Hotter than Madhuri or Raveena
dancing in the rain.

1362
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:10,670
Geeta Dutt's voice.

1363
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,420
The words of a sad Gulzar song.

1364
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:17,260
I loved Bindu more than
all these things.

1365
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:21,130
And I wanted her back.

1366
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:24,510
- Why are you out of breath?
- I was running.

1367
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,850
From Mumbai?

1368
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,600
Take of those headphones!

1369
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:31,230
Abhi, I know...

1370
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:37,150
In this moment...

1371
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:39,650
...no song was playing...

1372
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,240
...nor sound in the background.

1373
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:44,950
No sixteen-piece orchestra.

1374
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:49,000
Only Abhi...

1375
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,080
...and Bindu...

1376
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:54,540
...and their fast beating hearts.

1377
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,760
The End.

1378
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:38,170
Happy endings sell better.

1379
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:46,800
This is your story, Abhi.

1380
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,430
My version would be different.

1381
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,060
Really?

1382
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:56,560
What would be your version?

1383
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,940
What difference does it make?
I like this one better.

1384
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:04,950
At least...

1385
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:07,870
...you found your happy ending.

1386
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:09,740
Your Mr Right.

1387
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:12,500
I guess...

1388
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,790
Mr Right place, right time.

1389
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:18,040
Does he look like me?
Hot and handsome.

1390
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:26,720
Actually, he's really handsome.

1391
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,680
Not like you at all.

1392
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:48,910
I don't want anyone else to read it.

1393
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,450
My mother, your husband.

1394
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:56,870
This is ours.

1395
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:00,710
Yeah.

1396
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:11,180
Listen.

1397
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,100
Tell me if you still want to
run away with me.

1398
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:17,310
I'll carry you on my shoulders...

1399
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:19,270
...and whoosh!

1400
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:31,780
I'll be too heavy for you now.

1401
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:59,190
I admit we are not friends.

1402
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:04,110
I admit we are not lovers.

1403
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:21,080
But do not turn
to look at me...

1404
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:25,710
...my heart cannot be trusted.

1405
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:30,930
I admit we are not friends.

1406
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:59,750
If we meet somewhere
by chance...

1407
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:04,250
...stop and shake my hand.

1408
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:20,640
If someone is walking
by your side...

1409
01:50:21,770 --> 01:50:25,360
...then smile at me from afar.

1410
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:31,860
But in that smile...

1411
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:36,450
...show not a trace of familiarity.

1412
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:53,470
Do not let your eyes express...

1413
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:57,890
...what I can't deny.

1414
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:03,020
I admit we are not friends.

1415
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:08,900
Life keeps turning from Side A
to Side B.

1416
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:14,490
Sometimes you like a song
so much you fear it will end.

1417
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:19,660
Sometimes a song never leaves
your lips.

1418
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:25,080
Sometimes it's only
the tune that lingers.

1419
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:32,300
Those memories in the folds
of the pages...

1420
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:36,220
...let them turn to dust.

1421
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:53,280
If my name comes to your lips...

1422
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:57,910
...just say it was a mistake.

1423
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:04,500
But even that mistake
should be one...

1424
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:08,830
...that you never tire of.

1425
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:13,170
Today she is Mrs Nair.

1426
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:16,420
A mother, a daughter-in-law.

1427
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:20,350
But to me, she's still
my Bindu.

1428
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:25,020
She still comes into my dark life
and brightens it.

1429
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:32,980
My Bindu.

1430
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:38,150
My sweet Bindu.
