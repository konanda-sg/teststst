1
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,720
Holland!

2
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,400
One of those rare countries
that's below sea level.

3
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,800
And the weight of you tourists
is bearing it down further.

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Look to your right. So they had
to build these windmills...

5
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,520
...that pump out water
from the fields.

6
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
If I face you and say
right, it means your left.

7
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,960
When I turn my back to you, my
left and your left are in synch.

8
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,320
Any questions? I can
give you any info...

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
...except for star Deepika
Padukone's cell number.

10
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,240
Like her?

11
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,400
Want a picture of you
and the windmill?

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,400
Before our long bus trip,
I can pee for you too.

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,240
Only for you, Sarlaben.
All good?

14
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,040
Seventeen! 17 and a half.
18 and a half.

15
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,640
The past has faded from memory.
The present is where I live.

16
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,280
I travel on. Who knows
where I'm heading.

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Where am I?

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
Faith let me believe...

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,080
...that the world is good.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
And those I meet on the way...

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,680
...who walk with
me for a while...

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,560
...are good people too. I know.

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,200
Just a little cross...

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,880
...that drifting traveller...

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,680
...was from my village.

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,480
That old path...

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,080
...whose memories I
could not escape.

28
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,120
My home shed tears without me.

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,720
I have a nagging fear...

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,880
...that I no longer
belong to my home.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,160
I'm a man journey has chosen.

32
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,800
Neither from here
nor from there.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm a man journey has chosen.

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,080
Neither from here
nor from there.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm a man journey has chosen.

36
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,080
That's me.

37
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
That's me.

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,440
That's me.

39
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
I befriend milestones.

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,960
The road knows me by my gait.

41
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,600
Every day...

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,480
...the world feels
the same every day.

43
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,040
I sell cities to
people of leisure.

44
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,400
I leave empty-handed, I
return empty-handed.

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,200
Every day...

46
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,080
...I'm becoming a
stranger to myself.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,240
When I turned from
village to city...

48
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,840
...turning bitter, like poison.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,960
Every day...

50
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,520
...I wish it could
have been different.

51
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,640
This age, this time, this
road keeps passing by.

52
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm a man journey has chosen.

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,760
That's me.

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,920
You lot are the most
ungrateful wretches. Get lost!

55
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,840
Eat as many theplas, dhoklas
and fafdas as you want.

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,600
But get out of my face.

57
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,320
Curses on you!

58
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,760
- Your phone isn't working?
- Why?

59
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
I lost my ring.

60
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,280
I was engaged on this trip. The
ring my fiancé gave me is lost.

61
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,400
- You'll miss your flight.
- I know.

62
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
I can't leave without my ring.

63
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,760
I tell you what...

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
Send an email to
"YourEuroTravels."

65
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Describe your ring and
explain where you lost it.

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,760
Send them your address.

67
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
- I know where the ring is.
- Where?

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,120
It's in the Amsterdam hotel
where you put us up.

69
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,720
No problem! Run!
Catch your flight.

70
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,240
I'll tell them you're coming.

71
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,880
I won't change my mind, boss.
Not going without my ring.

72
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,760
No point staying, ma'am.

73
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,720
Hello...Flight status? 9W231.

74
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
Let's go to the hotel.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,680
Unfortunately, ma'am, I'm
headed the other way.

76
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,520
No worries. I'll get you a taxi.

77
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,760
How generous! A taxi!
You're coming with me.

78
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,360
No way, ma'am.

79
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,560
You can't order
me about anymore.

80
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,720
The tour is over.
Talk to me politely.

81
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,680
So two-faced! Tour's over so
you show your true colours.

82
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,400
It's just that you folk don't
consider others like humans.

83
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,880
Aren't I human too? How
can I travel all alone?

84
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
Where's the loving fiancé?

85
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,400
We fought. I told him
I lost the ring.

86
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,440
He's gone?

87
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,000
The ring belonged to his family.
He got upset and said:

88
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,360
"It's a sign that you don't care.
Wedding cancelled." Cool!

89
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,600
I tore up the boarding pass and
said I'd return with the ring.

90
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,160
Has your family left too?

91
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,480
You mean half my family?

92
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,000
They let you stay alone?

93
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,240
I'm a modern woman.
"Let me?" Meaning?

94
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,200
I told my Dad I knew
where the ring was.

95
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,720
His flight hasn't taken off.
Call him, say you're with me.

96
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,280
But I am not.

97
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,120
I'm trying to explain.

98
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,240
I have another booking.
I must go.

99
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,560
I'll pay you. How much?

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,120
It's not always about money.

101
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,760
It's always about money.

102
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,200
What's your daily rate?

103
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,720
Ma'am, I can't come with you.
Please understand.

104
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,640
And I am sorry.

105
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,520
No, I'm sorry.

106
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,760
I have no option. I
can't let you go.

107
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,520
So, I am sorry.

108
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
Your bag...

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,160
See? It's always about money!

110
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Shall we go?

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
Want the volume up?

112
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,720
I don't mind.

113
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
You want it higher?

114
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,880
I don't understand the words.
What language is it?

115
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,800
French.

116
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,320
I learned French
till 7th standard.

117
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,760
- I'll get you on tomorrow's flight.
- We find the ring first.

118
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,320
- You know where it is?
- It must be there.

119
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,560
There? Where?

120
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,000
I told you many times the
ring fell off my finger.

121
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,520
So you know where it fell?

122
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
Yes.

123
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,160
In the restaurant where
my engagement took place.

124
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,400
In the restaurant?

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,440
It was a romantic engagement, so
it happened in the restaurant.

126
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
You said it fell in the hotel.

127
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,920
The hotel restaurant,
where we ate last night.

128
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,800
So it fell in the restaurant
where you got engaged?

129
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,840
Better in the car, no?

130
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,760
I swear.

131
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,880
I'm hiring a car like this
on our honeymoon. Open top!

132
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
I have to find that ring. God!

133
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,240
This Amsterdam, is it in France?

134
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
Netherlands.

135
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
Why is this song French?

136
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,720
I don't know.

137
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,360
"My beloved, my sweetheart."

138
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,640
My romantic engagement
took place here.

139
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,400
He sat there, I sat here.

140
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,280
Sailesh, Nimesh and
his wife were here.

141
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,400
And...what's his name?

142
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,800
Is the name so important?

143
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,480
Ok. So your family were cosy
at your romantic engagement.

144
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,600
So where did the ring fall?

145
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm thinking! No need for sarcasm.
It was very romantic.

146
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,040
He came up to me. Went
down on his knees.

147
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,440
I gave him my hand. He put the ring on.
I reacted, wow!

148
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Then everyone clapped.

149
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,520
They asked me to show
them the ring and I did.

150
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
The ring was loose.

151
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,880
Bhabhi said we'd get it fixed in India.
It must be here.

152
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,280
They've cleaned the place. The
staff have found nothing.

153
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,680
It slipped off right here.
I remember.

154
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,600
You remember? But it
was only last night.

155
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
- We came here the last time too.
- What?

156
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
We first landed in Amsterdam.
You brought us here.

157
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,640
We had dinner and the
engagement took place.

158
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,600
- What are you doing?
- Booking tonight's flight.

159
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,360
Not going without the ring.

160
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,800
It's high season.
Where will you stay?

161
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,800
Do as you please. Live or die.
What's it to me?

162
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,000
Ma'am, I'm off.

163
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
- I paid you for the day.
- So...

164
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Let's sit and relax.

165
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,920
Some coffee? Don't worry.
It's my treat.

166
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,760
I don't drink coffee.
Too much caffeine.

167
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,160
Espresso, please. One.

168
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,440
You know what?

169
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,800
In the middle of
your nonsense...

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,080
...I remembered
where my ring fell.

171
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
- Know where?
- I'm sure you'll tell me.

172
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,520
The ship? The day trip?

173
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,240
We went to a cheese factory and
an art museum. That's where!

174
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,160
I have a photo on my Ipad.

175
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Thank God I remembered. The
ring didn't fall here.

176
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
Sorry. Let's go.

177
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,280
What's your name, ma'am?

178
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,880
Didn't Rupen tell you?

179
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,800
But Rupen isn't here. So you'll
have to tell me your name.

180
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
Your name?

181
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,920
Sejal. And Sejal means...

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,040
The meaning is irrelevant.
Sejal will do.

183
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,840
No need for you to
pay me for today.

184
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,720
Hey, all the best.

185
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,280
- So you won't cooperate?
- No way!

186
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
I'll complain.

187
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,040
I'll check your card.

188
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,880
Ma'am! Is this fair?

189
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,600
It's absolutely fair.

190
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,080
You have a split personality.
You fooled me. I will complain.

191
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
Please understand.

192
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,840
I was booked for your tour.
I have another booking.

193
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
- What booking?
- My business.

194
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,720
That's an excuse.

195
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes, it's an excuse.

196
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,520
I've stood at attention for
a month for your group.

197
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,520
Ticket, bus, train, phone,
Indian food, sanitary napkins...

198
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,760
What's another day?

199
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,600
Why not spend a month looking
for your ring in every city?

200
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,960
You don't know where it is.
Maybe it's under the sofa...

201
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,960
...or in Vienna,
Prague, or Budapest.

202
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,120
That's profit for you! You'll
be earning a daily rate.

203
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,680
And for what?

204
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
Travelling, looking for my
ring, and making some calls.

205
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,200
A few hours and it's done.
Then it's your time.

206
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,280
No tension, only relaxation.

207
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,080
A paid holiday!

208
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,120
Actually I don't understand
what's your problem.

209
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,160
You're panicking.

210
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,600
She's a girl.

211
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
If another girl complains,
know what the boss will do?

212
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,960
The boss is under pressure.
He's had 25 calls already.

213
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,640
Her family is in the diamond
business in Mumbai.

214
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,240
They say their daughter is all alone.
They trust Harry...

215
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,520
...to look after her.

216
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,680
Is Harry the only one they know?

217
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,440
Do they know the
kind of guy he is?

218
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,960
Did I ask her to cling to me?

219
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,800
This is crazy! This is a first.

220
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
A girl chasing you
and you're upset?

221
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,880
What's so funny?

222
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,880
If I quit, you can manage
YourEuro Travels with your boss.

223
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,560
The idiot won't stop calling.

224
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,440
Blast!

225
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,920
I've been trying you.
Line's engaged.

226
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,160
Hello! Bad signal...

227
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,360
Talk to the girl.
Confide in her.

228
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,280
Are you crazy? You mean
tell her everything?

229
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
Nehra isn't here.
I'll look for Harry.

230
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,200
You asked me...

231
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,920
Well?

232
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,040
"What's your problem?" I
mean what's my problem.

233
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,320
Can I talk?

234
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,320
More excuses? God! How much now?

235
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,680
I shouldn't tell you, but
you keep calling my boss.

236
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
I have no choice I'll have to...

237
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,720
...confide in you.

238
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,760
What's wrong? Come in.

239
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
Close the door.

240
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,160
I have a bad character.

241
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you understand?

242
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,120
Character, ma'am!

243
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,760
Girls are not safe with me.

244
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,120
- Meaning?
- Meaning! I'm a sleaze.

245
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm cheap! A womanizer.

246
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,240
I've been caught
flirting with clients.

247
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,320
Bad! I know it.

248
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,280
That's my problem.

249
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Are you scaring me?

250
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,560
No! I'm the one who is scared.

251
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,760
The client makes excuses and runs off.
And who gets caught?

252
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
Who pays?

253
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,440
I've been fired four times.

254
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Not because I'm bad at my job.
I'm A-One.

255
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,080
I should own a travel
agency by now.

256
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,640
But I'm still a tour guide.
This is the reason why.

257
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,520
- What reason?
- I have a weakness for girls.

258
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
Moved cities.

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,880
Gone underground many times.

260
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,960
What happens with these girls?

261
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,200
Who knows! It's a
bloody mystery.

262
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,840
I know what I am doing.

263
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,000
I tell myself...

264
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,720
"Stop, you'll get in trouble."

265
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,960
"All hell will break
loose" But I don't stop.

266
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,320
I cross the line. Then it's the
same old story, the arguments...

267
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,520
I test myself.

268
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,320
I keep trying to control myself.

269
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,000
But I fail every single time.

270
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,240
Don't want to risk it again.

271
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,360
Don't want to go there. I
don't want to work for you.

272
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,360
If another client complains,
forget being sacked...

273
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,440
...I'll be deported from Europe.
Out!

274
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,960
So you're saying if we travelled
together, we'd have sex?

275
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,760
That's crazy! Did I say that?

276
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,240
I didn't say any such thing.

277
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm saying Mayank is a very
experienced tour guide.

278
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,920
- Who?
- Mayank.

279
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,080
He's marrying his sweetheart.
He's safe!

280
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,000
He'll be with you and
I'll be in touch.

281
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,120
So he's safe and I'll touch.

282
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,520
Ladies? That's your problem?

283
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,160
Any other problems?

284
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
No, only one.

285
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,320
Tea, coffee?

286
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
A cold drink, a juice?

287
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Take a seat.

288
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
Indemnity bond.

289
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,640
It states that I asked you of my
own free will to travel with me.

290
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,880
In the duration of which...

291
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
...if there is any physical
interaction between us...

292
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,520
...amounting to or not amounting
to full copulation...

293
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,320
I shall not take any legal
action against you.

294
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,280
You're absolved of
all legal charges.

295
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,720
I'm a lawyer. I handle my
family's legal matters.

296
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,760
Terrific!

297
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,360
So I'll show this
paper to the judge?

298
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,440
"My lord! Ms Sejal's charges against
me are baseless and irrelevant.

299
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,520
"This hotel letterhead
memo clearly..."

300
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Are you serious?

301
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,920
Forget the courts...

302
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,680
...gossip in the tour circuit
is enough to ruin me.

303
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,080
They all know my problem.

304
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,200
Ok. It's your problem. I
don't have this problem.

305
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,680
You have bad traits.

306
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,160
I don't.

307
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,520
I'm neat and clean.

308
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,080
Can't control yourself? I can.

309
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,360
Anytime, anywhere, anyone.

310
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,480
Don't say I didn't warn you.

311
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,720
High hopes, eh?

312
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,200
Goodnight.

313
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,720
She's a fool.

314
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,120
Bet she knows nothing about sex.
Even if she's about to marry.

315
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,320
What do couples do?

316
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
More like brothers and sisters.

317
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,000
Cool.

318
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,560
Get the Frankfurt booking done.

319
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,120
Ask the boss to put pressure on
her father and call her back.

320
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,560
Stubborn girl.

321
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,200
They'll nag me forever.

322
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,080
"You lost the engagement ring.
Mummy's ring."

323
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,000
They won't let me forget.

324
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,400
That's why I left the flight.

325
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,680
It's just one day. We'll
find the ring tomorrow.

326
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,600
Sister, find a cure for your insomnia.
Now go to sleep.

327
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,560
Yes, I'm fine.

328
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,240
Goodnight. JSK...

329
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,000
You cheat. Rascal,
that's what you are.

330
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,000
Nice girl, eh?

331
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,800
Last night?

332
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,880
Got the job done?

333
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,400
You must have. That's your style.
Well?

334
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,960
Done it with your boyfriend?

335
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,200
No? You two are not the type.

336
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,800
Why aren't we the type?

337
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,920
We're looking for a ring.
No point getting personal.

338
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,760
Let's get personal. Why
wouldn't we have done it?

339
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,720
I want to know.

340
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
Because he left you alone here.
That's no good.

341
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
You left that girl too.

342
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
Not the same relationship.

343
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Does your man feel for
you like I feel for her?

344
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,360
Do I care if someone
lives or dies?

345
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm getting a coffee.
You, ma'am?

346
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,440
So you'll teach me how
to treat loved ones?

347
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,720
Perfect counsel.

348
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,600
You coming?

349
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,520
You think the ring would
still be here after a month?

350
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
Why am I looking then?

351
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,960
If I told you...
you won't like it.

352
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,040
It must be here. See?

353
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,480
The ring is on my finger.
I'm wearing a floral top.

354
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,600
That's the last place we visited.
Rijksmuseum.

355
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,040
How it is possible? The ring
was on my finger in the photo.

356
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,880
Do you have a photo
of it slipping off?

357
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,120
Very funny!

358
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
The ring could've fallen here.
Or in Budapest or Prague...

359
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,480
- ...any place on the tour.
- That's just it.

360
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,400
Ma'am, forget the ring.
Everyone has been informed.

361
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,920
If they don't find
it, buy another one.

362
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
You're in the diamond business.
Get a better ring.

363
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,440
Forget this one.

364
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,040
Do you understand emotions?

365
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,400
Emotions?

366
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,760
Should've taken another booking.

367
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,120
What shall I do, sister? If I
don't find it, do I forget it?

368
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,360
Calm Papa down.

369
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,720
Tell him Harry is with me.
Papa knows he's helpful.

370
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,360
I'll do some shopping in Prague.

371
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,520
What a coincidence!

372
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,480
Are you following me?

373
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,280
Why would I?

374
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,640
Wow!

375
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,640
- You can't stay here.
- Why not?

376
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,720
- Because I say so. Come.
- Don't bully me.

377
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,800
You're not my guide here. We're
not looking for the ring.

378
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,120
Go. She's waiting.

379
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,560
Smart! This place isn't for you.

380
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,960
I think it is.

381
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,880
No, it isn't.

382
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,520
How do you know the true me?

383
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,840
I see.

384
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,720
You're something else!

385
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,120
I was...

386
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,360
So you're hitting on me?

387
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
No.

388
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,880
Why not? Aren't I sexy?

389
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,000
- No.
- No?

390
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,280
Not even a little?

391
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,280
And now?

392
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,520
You're very cute.
You're very sweet.

393
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,080
I can see that. But sexy
moves don't suit you.

394
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,080
You're not the kind of
girl that guys hits on.

395
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
You're like a Chinese vase.
Beautiful, pure, delicate.

396
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,160
Lovely to look at.

397
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,960
Meaning, I'm boring?

398
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,640
Boring. Not hot?

399
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,560
That's not what I'm saying.

400
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,680
I said you're
beautiful and pure...

401
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,800
...and sweet, nice, sister-type.

402
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,040
Sisters can be beautiful too.
So I'm cold, not hot?

403
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,960
What's with you girls?

404
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,360
Pay you a compliment...

405
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,640
...and you find a way of
turning it into an insult.

406
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,120
- It is an insult.
- Are you nuts?

407
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,240
An insult? Saying guys
won't hit on you?

408
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,920
- Insulting my body.
- How?

409
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,440
Here I am flirting and you say:

410
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,600
"No, sweet baby."

411
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,400
"Don't. You don't turn me on.
Not my type."

412
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,040
And you...a womanizer, not attracted to me?
Am I that...?

413
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,840
Is this for real?

414
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,680
Me? Running after you?

415
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,680
The progress we've
made in a day!

416
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,000
Why are you coming behind me?

417
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,440
- You're going the wrong way.
- I'll find my way.

418
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,560
Before that you'll find a
villain who'll kidnap you.

419
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,320
At least he'll find
me attractive.

420
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,440
Let go off me.

421
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,000
- You mean it?
- Let go or you'll be in trouble.

422
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,560
I won't let go. So
what happens now?

423
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,520
- What will you do?
- Let go!

424
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Are you done?

425
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,920
Let go!

426
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,600
Don't try to dominate me.
I'm not your girlfriend.

427
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,120
I'm sorry, ma'am.

428
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
I shouldn't behave like this.

429
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,840
Scared I'd complain?

430
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,560
Ma'am, to your left.

431
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,360
The boss insisted that I
help the lady to find it.

432
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,160
We're looking everywhere.

433
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,200
- Where to?
- Why?

434
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,880
These places are dodgy.
And you're all dolled up.

435
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,840
Let me sign another indemnity bond.
Yes?

436
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,920
Get me something wicked.

437
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,440
Too crowded.

438
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,760
No problem.

439
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,240
We go to private room.
Much better, no crowd.

440
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,400
I like Paki girls.

441
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,000
What you drinking?

442
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,320
Wild, yeah? How wild? Show me.

443
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,800
Harry!

444
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,360
No. Harry!

445
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,040
What? Harry, Harry!

446
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,200
What Harry?

447
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,160
I told you these places are dodgy.
You'd get into trouble.

448
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,880
Thought I was
barking like a dog?

449
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,560
One minute, my friend.

450
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,080
My head's all messed up.

451
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,960
What can Harry do? Tell me!

452
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,400
What can Harry do?

453
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,160
Fight a random stranger?

454
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,280
Put my life on the line?

455
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,520
Will you keep staring like a bat?
Or will you run?

456
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,280
Have you no brains? Run!

457
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,200
Hurry! Run!

458
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,480
Run, will you?

459
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,640
The Mafia?

460
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,920
Stop!

461
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,280
So sorry.

462
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,960
I shouldn't have hit him.

463
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,880
Why not?

464
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,160
He needed ten blows
between the legs.

465
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,480
Scumbag!

466
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,840
He can play gangster at home.
Glad you hit him.

467
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,800
Hope they don't find us.
Bad place to get caught.

468
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,840
You crying?

469
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,480
Why are you crying?

470
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,160
- Don't know.
- If you don't know, then don't cry.

471
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,520
They'll hear us.

472
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,200
If Rupen was here,
he would kill me.

473
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,560
He'd be mad if he hears.

474
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,800
Don't tell him. How
would he know?

475
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,920
- I won't tell him.
- Don't tell him.

476
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,160
He always thinks I'm to blame...

477
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,680
...and that I don't understand.
I don't care.

478
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,640
I'm here because of his ring.
And he hasn't called even once.

479
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,840
I don't care.

480
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,600
- Looking for a ring like some nutcase.
- Ssh! They'll hear us.

481
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,160
- Blast!
- Have they found us?

482
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,400
Come here!

483
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,880
What now?

484
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,000
- What will they do to me?
- Quiet!

485
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,840
- Will they force themselves on me?
- Quiet!

486
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,920
If they force me,
what shall I do?

487
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,640
Shut up!

488
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,960
- Practically speaking...
- Practically? Shut it!

489
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,240
- Here?
- Inside.

490
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,120
Where to?

491
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,600
The hotel's over there.

492
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,000
You missing them or something?

493
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,600
- How you are talking.
- How you are talking!

494
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,440
Waiting for them to
"practically...?"

495
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,160
I was terrified. I thought...

496
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,680
Thought what? You're crazy.

497
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,440
Why are you so upset?

498
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,400
Why am I upset? You're
not even my girlfriend.

499
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,400
You're an uninvited guest.
Blast!

500
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
Sejal...

501
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,920
...go home.

502
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,680
This is too silly.

503
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,160
You won't find your ring.

504
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,240
Seek, and you can even find God.

505
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,320
How would you know?

506
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,320
Have you found God?

507
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,400
I haven't.

508
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,080
You would've found Him,
if you had looked.

509
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,280
Maybe you have found what
you were looking for.

510
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,120
I was not looking for you.
That's for sure.

511
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,600
Wrong.

512
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,640
Live well, even if you
belong to another.

513
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,400
Live well, even if you
belong to another.

514
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,560
Don't forget to sometime
send word of how you are.

515
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,120
Perhaps the seasons
abroad take care of you.

516
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,080
Don't forget to sometime
send word of how you are.

517
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,120
Perhaps the seasons
abroad take care of you.

518
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:55,720
Here, every season feels
like autumn without you.

519
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:07,480
Live well, even if you
belong to another.

520
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:15,600
You may not be mine now
but you were once.

521
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,680
Live well, even if you
belong to another.

522
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,880
It happens, I know. It's ok.

523
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,680
It happens. Never mind.

524
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,040
Have you been to Punjab?

525
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,000
No.

526
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,680
I'm from there.

527
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,240
A small place, Nurmahal.

528
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,520
My village.

529
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,000
Know why Punjabi
singers sing so loud?

530
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,680
They sing loudly.

531
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,480
Do you know why?

532
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,000
They're farmers. When they drive
their tractors they sing.

533
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,320
They sing over the tractor
sound to hear themselves.

534
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,200
Can you sing?

535
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,200
I had to sing at every
family birthday.

536
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,320
I know many songs.

537
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,080
I ran away to Canada
to become a singer.

538
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,240
Really?

539
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,320
Leaping from terrace to
terrace at midnight.

540
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,200
Did you think being
a lover is easy?

541
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,040
Your turn.

542
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,120
Looking deep into your
eyes I made a vow...

543
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,080
...that I will be your Radha.

544
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,160
Beloved, I will be your Radha.

545
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,920
Nice, sweet, sister-type.

546
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,760
Can you raise the heat?

547
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,040
Let me sing for you.

548
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,360
Leaping from terrace to
terrace at midnight.

549
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,080
Leaping from terrace to
terrace at midnight.

550
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,720
Do you think being
a lover is easy?

551
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,080
Do you think being
a lover is easy?

552
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,160
Lovers fight and quarrel.

553
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,000
The wise always say:

554
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,840
The days of youth
are fleeting...

555
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,800
...once gone, never to return.

556
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,040
Throw caution to the wind.

557
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,480
I will be your Radha.

558
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,920
I'll keep you close
to my heart...

559
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,160
...closer than any other.

560
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,240
I will be your Radha.

561
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,560
Keep me safe in your dreams...

562
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,120
...more than any other.

563
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,600
I will be your Radha.

564
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,960
How can I venture out when
mist covers the month of June?

565
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,840
We toss and turn
on a bed of rope.

566
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,960
The wise call this
the fire of youth.

567
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,080
Don't make false promises.

568
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,520
I will be your Radha.

569
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,120
The thoughts I never shared...

570
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,640
...I now share with you.

571
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,360
I care little for anyone...

572
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,320
...I only care for you.

573
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,720
You're a fibber. I
shan't be missing you.

574
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,720
Once you're gone,
I'll forget you.

575
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,400
I surrender to the magical
sound of your flute.

576
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,920
Youth's fire will
not be put out.

577
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,400
So burn we will.

578
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,760
- I will be your Radha.
- You will be my Radha.

579
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,040
I'll keep you close
to my heart...

580
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,440
...closer than any other.

581
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,760
I will be your Radha.

582
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,160
Keep me safe in your dreams...

583
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,520
...more than any other.

584
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,920
I will be your Radha.

585
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,600
Not worth touching?

586
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,080
- Will your wife hit you?
- What wife?

587
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,040
No wife? Girlfriend?

588
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,080
You don't need one, you
get enough action.

589
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,960
If I had someone, I
wouldn't look for action.

590
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,200
You're lonely.

591
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,600
That's why you were crying.

592
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,600
You're lonely.

593
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,600
Will you find me someone?

594
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,480
I can't even find a ring!

595
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,400
As long as I'm here,
consider me your girlfriend.

596
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,880
You don't need to feel
lonely with me around.

597
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,120
Five whatsapp
messages from Rupen.

598
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,000
Give me your phone, please.

599
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,160
Sit down.

600
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,840
- You talk, I'll come back.
- It's ok.

601
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,720
Hi, sweetie.

602
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,320
Five messages?

603
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,040
Don't worry. I'm fine.

604
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,040
Prague. Yes.

605
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,600
What? Really?

606
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,320
Oh God!

607
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,120
The ring was on my
finger in Budapest.

608
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,560
I showed the ring
to Rupen's friends.

609
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,720
He sent the photo. We
were wasting time...

610
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,760
Shall I call you on
Facechat, honey?

611
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,040
It's free.

612
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,200
Hello? Excuse me. I'll get this.

613
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,760
Yes, I called.

614
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,080
Sir, your espresso.

615
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,200
What's happening to me?

616
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,400
A guy like me...

617
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,480
No understand.

618
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,680
Even I no understand.

619
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,160
You were looking at me.

620
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,560
You were looking.

621
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,400
So I was. Is that bad?

622
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,040
Why deny it?

623
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,360
What's this?

624
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,840
You're so beautiful!

625
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,120
So stare away. A
Chinese vase, right?

626
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,440
Lovely to see, but touch not.

627
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,640
Keep looking. It's allowed now
that I'm your girlfriend.

628
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:32,080
Why do I see your face...

629
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,640
...in my every dream?
What's the secret?

630
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,520
You were not mine yesterday...

631
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:53,880
...nor will you be tomorrow.
You're mine only for today.

632
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,960
All my loyalties are to you.

633
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,640
You are the one I pray for.

634
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,240
Who knows where this
breeze will take you.

635
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,400
Who knows where this
breeze will take me.

636
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,160
These tourist spots look the same.
How will we find the café?

637
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,120
Is this it?

638
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,760
He came from there.

639
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,960
I was standing here. I waved to him.
Help me!

640
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,680
Pretend you're Rupen.
Walk down the steps.

641
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,400
Take me to the café.

642
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,760
This helps?

643
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,040
It'll help me remember.
Walk up those steps.

644
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,680
This way, please.

645
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,000
Who treats a fiancé like that?

646
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,760
How do I know what Rupen does?

647
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,200
Forget Rupen.

648
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,320
What would you do? Now
that I'm your girlfriend.

649
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,080
We haven't met all day.

650
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,560
We meet, you take
me to the café.

651
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,800
Follow your heart.

652
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,080
Feel it.

653
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:24,200
I shall keep you there...

654
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:31,320
...near my faith and belief.

655
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:38,800
If I cannot belong to you...

656
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:46,120
...I shall belong to no one.

657
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:53,760
Who knows where this
breeze will take you.

658
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,400
This breeze so unknown,
so rebellious.

659
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,080
Who knows where this
breeze will take me.

660
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:08,520
Neither you nor I know
where we are heading.

661
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:33,080
These memories that you make,
how long can they last?

662
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:40,400
I keep going day and night
thanks to these moments.

663
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,800
My world of dreams exists...

664
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,680
...only because of you.

665
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:55,040
The winds that pass me
by call out your name.

666
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:02,280
These winds that call out to me,
I don't know what they say.

667
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,960
Who knows where this
breeze will take you.

668
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,600
Who knows where this
breeze will take me

669
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:16,920
Neither you nor I know
where we are heading.

670
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,200
I wish Rupen was like you.

671
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,880
Will you train him?

672
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,920
I'll be sorted for life.

673
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,720
Get him on Facetime. I'll
train him right now.

674
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,000
I remember!

675
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,720
This was the exact spot.

676
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,760
The ring was on my finger.
Don't remember after that.

677
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,720
Shall I tell you? Now, all
hell will break loose.

678
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,960
Your heart is now racing.

679
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,800
Your lips are softening.

680
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,800
It's so pleasing.

681
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,120
We're falling in a trap.

682
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,920
So?

683
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,600
Sejal, a time will come
when you'll have to leave.

684
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,280
No matter what happens
between us, you must leave.

685
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,920
Just don't look back.

686
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,600
You're saying, maybe
I won't leave...

687
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,960
...I'll cancel the wedding,
break the engagement and stay?

688
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,560
Is that what you're asking?

689
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,800
No.

690
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,720
I'm not the type to dump my
fiancé for a tour guide.

691
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,920
Don't worry. It's ok.

692
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,400
It hurts me to hear you say that.
I'm heartbroken.

693
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,680
You're naive. There's
a rocky road ahead.

694
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,240
Many wiser than you have
got lost on this path.

695
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,160
They make one mistake
and undo their lives.

696
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,560
Harry, will you come to my wedding?
25 November in Mumbai.

697
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,800
It'll be fun. Rupen and
I look good together.

698
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,000
You'll see for yourself.

699
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,440
You won't be able to.
You'll feel hurt.

700
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,760
You don't know me, Sejal.

701
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,480
But I know myself.

702
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,600
I am very selfish.

703
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,000
I play cute now, say all
the right things...

704
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,520
...pretend I'm
your girlfriend...

705
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,360
...but when we find the ring.
It's bye bye.

706
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,800
I'm not the type to get hurt.
But watch your heart.

707
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,040
Really?

708
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,080
You have high hopes, right?

709
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,160
Sweetie! We'll see about
those high hopes.

710
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,320
We'll see.

711
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,640
That's right.

712
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,000
- The game is on!
- Absolutely!

713
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,400
Let's go.

714
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,000
You and me...

715
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,400
...between us, we
blow hot and cold.

716
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,240
I sing to your tune.
Between us, a song flows.

717
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,760
You and me...

718
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,240
...between us, we
blow hot and cold.

719
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,920
I sing to your tune.
Between us, a song flows.

720
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,640
Smoldering embers,
brimming with desire.

721
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,240
You and I burn in turns.

722
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,880
Our status will change...

723
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,520
...from single to
somewhere in between.

724
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,200
You and me...

725
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,720
...between us, we
blow hot and cold.

726
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,360
I see the sky flying...

727
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,600
...passed the earth.

728
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,760
Our story may or
may not be told.

729
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,520
Moments of folly...

730
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,600
...live them now or
they are gone forever.

731
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:02,000
The softest moments
swiftly pass us by.

732
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,720
Let me know you, all of you.

733
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,960
Who knows you, all of you?

734
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,160
Show me your anger, between
us, let it explode.

735
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,440
You're in Budapest, Manky?

736
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,480
So am I. I'll send
you my location.

737
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,160
Blast!

738
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,720
(German)

739
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,320
Don't mind her.

740
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,760
Hi! Who are you?

741
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,880
Who am I?

742
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,480
- That's what I asked.
- Who are you?

743
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,720
I'm his girlfriend.

744
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,360
Girlfriend?

745
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,960
No. He can never
have a girlfriend.

746
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,440
He has no heart.
He's just using you.

747
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,040
- Also that.
- No.

748
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,400
It's not what you think, Clara.
She's just a client.

749
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,160
Let her think what she wants.

750
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,280
And now tell me who you are?

751
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm the one he cheated and ran away.
He'll do the same to you.

752
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,720
Cheating is not good.

753
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,160
No! We'll settle this
matter immediately.

754
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,440
Come, we'll settle it.

755
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,200
- Sit!
- She says she has to go.

756
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,720
Ok, what's your complaint?

757
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,720
This man had fun
with me for years.

758
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,280
Then he ran away from Frankfurt
without informing me.

759
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,160
I had to go through
many troubles.

760
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,200
One two three - fun,
ran away, trouble.

761
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,720
So he had fun with you and
you did not have fun?

762
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,200
Means he had fun against your wishes?
By force?

763
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,560
It's not like that.

764
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,600
With your consent? Consensual?

765
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,960
That's not a legal
offence in Europe.

766
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,760
Ran away?

767
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,600
You have a signed
document stating...

768
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,160
...he cannot leave Frankfurt
without your permission? You have?

769
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,280
I get it!

770
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,240
- So answer me.
- No.

771
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,120
So no legal offence.

772
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,200
Trouble? What kinds of trouble?

773
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,800
All kinds of trouble.

774
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,480
Like what?

775
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,760
Even the keys, he didn't give
them to me when he went.

776
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,920
- You had to make a duplicate key?
- Yes!

777
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:52,960
And spend money?

778
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,520
- Of course.
- How much?

779
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,640
One euro, two euro?

780
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,120
Twenty euro.

781
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,480
Very bad.

782
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,480
Come on. Give her
twenty euro right now.

783
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,520
Sejal, what are you doing?

784
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,720
Take it. Don't be shy.

785
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,240
Take it.

786
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,600
Now you listen, sister Clara.

787
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,520
Harassment...what you just
did, that's a legal offence.

788
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,400
If you do it again...

789
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,000
...in public or private,
he can sue you.

790
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,800
So nice to see you.

791
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,280
Clara, see you later.

792
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,680
You're a piece of work.

793
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,640
I've avoided Frankfurt for
two years because of her...

794
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,800
Don't talk to me!

795
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,920
You were into her? You were
with her for two years?

796
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,600
But I'm not worth it? How
is she better than me?

797
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,560
Perhaps some day I'll explain.

798
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,880
Why "some day"? Tell me now.

799
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,080
If you have the guts.

800
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,080
- Well?
- I'm dying to tell you.

801
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,440
- Is that it?
- Not at all.

802
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,280
What are you doing?

803
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,280
- Have you no shame?
- I have your permission now.

804
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,560
- Mummy!
- Don't want your Mummy, I want you.

805
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,840
Control yourself!

806
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,680
Get some treatment.

807
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,440
You can't go on like this.

808
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,480
You're here?

809
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,760
Hello, ma'am. Mayank.

810
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,080
You said you had important news.

811
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,240
Breaking news about your ring!

812
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,800
You left your number
at the Budapest café.

813
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,120
The owner called.

814
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,080
They've found a diamond ring. But
someone else has claimed it.

815
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,360
Nastassja Spacek Dubronovijck.

816
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,240
She gave a Prague address.

817
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,280
So he gave her the ring?

818
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,000
Why you gave her the ring?

819
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,640
Where's the proof
that it's hers?

820
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,200
It's not a police station.

821
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,480
It's a café.

822
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,440
Nastassja must have
said her ring was lost.

823
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,120
So she took the ring.

824
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,920
Oh no! We almost found it.

825
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,560
- Did you try calling her?
- Yes. No reply.

826
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,280
Are white people thieves too?

827
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,240
Thieves don't care about
colour, caste or creed.

828
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,480
Thievery just happens.
Like love.

829
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,640
- We'll catch her in Prague.
- If she's there.

830
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,720
Thieves won't leave
a proper address.

831
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,960
Hello. Nastassja?

832
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,920
Is that Nastassja?

833
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,160
You must come to my
engagement and my wedding.

834
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,120
I can't. Try and understand.
Sejal!

835
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,960
Full aerobics in Europe!

836
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,400
- Ticket?
- Don't worry.

837
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,600
Why don't you go home?
It's been two years.

838
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,400
Clara is history.
Frankfurt is safe.

839
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,760
You don't get it.

840
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,440
I'm getting engaged in two days.
You can find the ring today...

841
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,160
...or tomorrow or later.
My wedding is on the 5th.

842
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,640
I'll come.

843
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,440
The groom's party is
not just the groom.

844
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,400
We could go shopping together.
Buy a gift for Irina.

845
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,920
We don't have family here.
We're orphans, in a way.

846
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,760
Don't overdo it! If we
find the ring, I'll come.

847
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,880
You must come too! The
groom's party must impress.

848
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,720
When we find the ring, I'm gone.

849
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,880
- Please stop, Sejal.
- Why?

850
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,480
I'll get used to this.

851
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,960
Where do you usually live?

852
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,240
I'm always on tour.
No spare time.

853
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,920
And if you have spare time?

854
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,760
I stay in the last
stop of the tour.

855
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,320
You rent an apartment?

856
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,680
I'm in tourism, Sejal.
I manage somehow.

857
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,720
You find someone?

858
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,520
No, you can't go on like this.
You should go home.

859
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,040
Why?

860
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,680
Because I say so. Any
problem with that?

861
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,080
Sejal, it's my personal business.
Don't interfere.

862
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,160
I will! What will you do?

863
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,920
You'll do as you please?

864
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,840
What are you looking at?

865
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,560
Sejal, can you give me a hug?

866
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,600
That's her. On the pole.

867
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,360
She's really worth it.

868
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,120
She's really worth it.

869
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,640
Naste, talk to Gas.

870
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,400
- Go!
- We're not with them.

871
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,680
- She'll walk you home.
- Come.

872
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,720
Gas is getting angry.

873
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,400
You're safe with us.

874
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,080
Are they dangerous?

875
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,960
Gas is waiting on phone.

876
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,840
- Talk!
- She doesn't want to.

877
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,440
Get away! Don't touch her.

878
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,080
Back off!

879
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,200
You're better than her.

880
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,640
You asked me how you rate.

881
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,160
Don't butt in.

882
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,480
Get it?

883
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,040
What did you say?

884
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,400
- Who are you?
- Shall I tell you?

885
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,320
The man who knows who you are.

886
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,440
So shut up and go.

887
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,560
No ID?

888
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,600
All illegal immigrants.

889
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,560
I could send you
packing from Europe.

890
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,640
Get it?

891
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,440
What are you staring at? Go!

892
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,280
Phone Gas. Seems dangerous.

893
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,600
- I am better than her?
- Cool it!

894
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,160
Better than her? Really?

895
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,640
This is my house.

896
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,960
Listen, Nastassja.

897
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,480
Last month you were
in Budapest...

898
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,520
...where you picked up
a ring from a café.

899
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,160
- It belongs to her.
- To her?

900
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,320
You took that ring, right?

901
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,920
- Yes.
- Thief!

902
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,640
How does the ring belong to her?

903
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,640
It does! You have to
return it to her, ok?

904
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,040
I don't have the ring.

905
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,360
You just said you had it.

906
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,960
When I got the ring, I
threw it back at his face.

907
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,920
At whose face?

908
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,600
Gas, the son of a $ #**!

909
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,920
He sent his men.

910
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,600
Why throw the ring at him?

911
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,000
Because he's scum.

912
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,480
His name is Gas?

913
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,000
Don't wanna be his girl.

914
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:33,080
I say - take the ring,
break-up, finish.

915
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,720
Gas gave you this ring?

916
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,200
Yes, but I hate him.

917
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,120
That scumbag.

918
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,480
This Gas got the ring from
the café and gave it to her.

919
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,920
And she lost it again?

920
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,200
- She threw it at his face.
- That was later.

921
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,080
Ask her where's the ring.

922
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,720
This Gas, does he have the ring?

923
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,480
He picked up the ring, came after
me saying please, please...

924
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,080
- So he has ring?
- Yes.

925
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,120
- Where is he? In Prague?
- No, between Sintra and Lisbon.

926
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,600
- In Portugal?
- Our tour didn't take us there.

927
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:17,320
Nastassja, tell me. Are you
are speaking the truth?

928
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,320
Why I lie? I hate him.

929
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,560
So you'll give me his
address, phone number...

930
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,520
I give it all.

931
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,040
Can I get a selfie with you?

932
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:30,920
Wait!

933
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,040
What does Gas do in Portugal?

934
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,680
Oh. He's a criminal.

935
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,440
"I do business, I have a
café." No, he is criminal.

936
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,800
This one is not nice.

937
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,600
- Take it from there. Better light.
- Come this side.

938
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,200
That's better.

939
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,800
Thank you.

940
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,160
Are you nuts, Sejal?

941
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,680
Two days, no news.

942
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,400
Rupen has been trying.

943
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,760
Sister, no tension.
I'm too sexy!

944
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,120
Even Rupen's Dad wants me.

945
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,360
This is a new side to you!

946
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,320
- What are you up to?
- I'm honeymooning.

947
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,640
I'll be as boring as
you after marriage.

948
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,160
So why not enjoy
a honeymoon now?

949
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,960
Don't talk nonsense. Where's Harry?
Is he with you?

950
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,080
I'm honeymooning with him.
Crazy girl!

951
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,640
Sejal, come off it! Be sensible.

952
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:47,640
Is this desire or devotion?

953
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:53,480
I must win you, come what may.

954
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,760
Here we go.

955
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,520
Here we fly.

956
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,600
I desire you in our skies.

957
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:11,000
Desiring you as long
as you are near.

958
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:16,920
The skies whizzes by, the
ground whizzes by...

959
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:21,680
...time whizzes by
as I desire you.

960
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:28,160
Desiring you as long
as you are near.

961
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,640
The high life that
we are living.

962
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:00,360
Ecstatic, intoxicating,
flying, high.

963
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,200
As the sky whizzes passed us.

964
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,120
Don't over-think this
thing between us.

965
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,920
Don't try to figure it all out.

966
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:26,680
Just live in this moment.

967
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:42,840
Is this desire or devotion?

968
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:48,640
I must win you, come what may.

969
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,520
This longing overwhelms me.

970
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:00,280
Feelings are more
than mere words.

971
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,000
Harindar, Mr. Gas has arrived.

972
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,120
Wait, I'll go see him.

973
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,200
- Don't worry.
- He's a criminal.

974
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,560
- Hello. You look for me?
- No, no.

975
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,520
Gas.

976
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,720
Harry.

977
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,440
My name is Ghyasuddin
Mohammed Qureshi.

978
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,920
Europeans can't pronounce
it, nor can I.

979
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,800
What can I do for you?

980
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,640
We're looking for a ring.

981
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,800
A ring.

982
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,360
For you?

983
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,360
Actually you have it.

984
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,280
The ring you gave Nastassja.

985
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,160
Sorry. I know that's
your private business.

986
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,200
The ring is very
important to us.

987
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,800
It's in my Lisbon workshop.

988
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,960
So you have it?

989
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,480
Not sure how the
ring belongs to you.

990
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,320
But if it's yours, take it.

991
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,840
It's of no use to me.

992
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,080
I didn't offer you anything.

993
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,680
Tea? Masala tea?

994
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,800
Cutting chai?

995
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,240
Take care.

996
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,720
I'm fine.

997
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,560
He's a sweet guy.

998
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,240
We can collect the ring
from his address tomorrow.

999
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,680
We had Gas all wrong.

1000
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,000
We'll find the ring tomorrow?

1001
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,360
Seems like it.

1002
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,760
I'm taking this with
me, my queen size bed.

1003
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:40,080
The sailor leaves the
shores for distant lands...

1004
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:45,000
...for the riches and
spices of India...

1005
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,880
...many hundreds of years ago.

1006
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,520
But his woman still
cries for him.

1007
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,160
She wails at night: "I
am lost without you."

1008
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,560
Come back to me.

1009
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,360
Come back from India.
Come back to your love.

1010
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,840
Hello India!

1011
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,000
Namaste! Salaam!

1012
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,400
Nehra here! Remember me?

1013
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,160
Eternal is the Glory
of the Timeless Lord!

1014
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,080
Nurmahal!

1015
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:00,640
Kulwant Kaur, I miss you!

1016
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,720
Who is she?

1017
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,560
She used to live in Nurmahal.

1018
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,960
- When you rode a tractor?
- Yes.

1019
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,360
Took her into the fields?

1020
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,400
Our love was true.

1021
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,080
We met only twice and
then she got married.

1022
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,080
One must miss someone, so I miss her.
Never told a soul.

1023
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,160
How come?

1024
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,040
People will misunderstand.
Kulwant Kaur...

1025
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,560
...they may think I miss a man.

1026
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,360
Your name is better.

1027
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,760
Sejal!

1028
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,920
All well?

1029
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,320
Sounds good.

1030
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,560
Sejal!

1031
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,480
I miss you!

1032
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,440
Come back! We'll go
looking for another ring.

1033
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,760
I have a gun.

1034
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,360
Go easy!

1035
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,680
- Have you lost your mind?
- Shut his mouth!

1036
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,160
All this for a ring?

1037
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,600
Why are you doing all this?

1038
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,080
You said you'll
have me deported?

1039
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,520
How will you do that exactly?

1040
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,920
Over here. She's here.

1041
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,800
I gave a ring to my girl.
She returned it to me.

1042
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,480
So how does the
ring belong to you?

1043
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,680
Put the gun away.

1044
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:31,760
You'd kill me for a ring?
Put it away!

1045
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,400
What's special about this ring?

1046
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,040
I don't get it.

1047
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,040
Talk straight.

1048
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,240
Who told you about me?

1049
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,400
What do you want? Who are you?

1050
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,280
I'll tell you.

1051
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,920
What?

1052
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,600
Ghyasuddin Mohammed Qureshi.

1053
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,800
That's my name!

1054
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,720
Who are you?

1055
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,520
That's the name we
have in our records.

1056
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:10,840
Records?

1057
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:12,720
What records?

1058
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,720
Illegal immigration.

1059
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,160
Get it?

1060
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,120
When someone sneaks into
Europe without papers...

1061
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,240
...then hides like a mouse.

1062
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,680
Like this.

1063
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,680
Your papers legit?

1064
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,080
Legal or illegal?

1065
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,000
Show me your ID card.
I'll explain.

1066
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,880
- I have to go to the toilet.
- Come here.

1067
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,040
- He's making a fool of you.
- Enough!

1068
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,480
Is this your idea
of a kidnapping?

1069
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,480
You left my phone in my pocket.
It's on.

1070
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,240
My department is tracking me.

1071
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,920
They won't be long.

1072
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,640
What is it?

1073
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,760
I thought my department arrived.

1074
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:07,880
Why are you going?

1075
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,080
Listen to me!

1076
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,480
I've had enough of you.

1077
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,480
Got a gun license?

1078
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,120
Not even that.

1079
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,120
Let go!

1080
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,960
What are you doing?

1081
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:28,320
What can I possibly do? This
is the story of my life.

1082
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,120
Floods in my country washed
away all my possessions.

1083
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,360
I am totally ruined.

1084
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,040
O Mother!

1085
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,640
- Untie us!
- Stop staring. Untie them!

1086
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,800
You OK?

1087
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,960
Sejal, now's not the
time, let's go.

1088
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,040
Get some water!

1089
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,120
Nothing's wrong. I am fine.

1090
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,360
Here's the water.

1091
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,400
O Mother!

1092
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,640
Take your time.

1093
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,480
Any antiseptic?

1094
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,080
Pass my bag.

1095
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,520
A big misunderstanding.

1096
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,160
Let's work it out.

1097
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,600
Why did you harass Nastassja?

1098
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,320
Me? I did no such thing.
I love her.

1099
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,040
Nothing but rings!
Pick any one you like.

1100
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,600
I want the Budapest café one.

1101
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,760
They're all the same.
They're all fakes.

1102
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,560
Nastassja didn't tell you?
That's why we broke up.

1103
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,480
She discovered the ring was
a fake and I sell fakes.

1104
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,480
So our ring can't be
among these fakes.

1105
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,840
- Is that so?
- I'm a scumbag, right? I lie.

1106
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:02,680
Ask Nastassja.

1107
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:11,280
Sejal, he says these
rings are fakes.

1108
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,360
Still, take a look.

1109
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,000
Found it?

1110
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:44,080
Like an ember it will burn...

1111
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,840
...this memory of ours.

1112
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:59,680
Stinging and singeing
this memory of ours.

1113
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:11,080
These memories
will torment us...

1114
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:17,160
...but we shall not complain.

1115
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:28,240
With the setting sun,
even the sky burns.

1116
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:40,840
I expect nothing...

1117
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:48,480
...and I can't complain.

1118
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:55,640
But you've become
a part of me...

1119
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:07,200
...and I long for you.

1120
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:26,560
This is just a feeling...

1121
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:36,520
...a fleeting sensation...

1122
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:45,480
...and yet I can't
stop longing for you.

1123
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:53,560
What can I do...

1124
01:37:53,640 --> 01:38:00,480
...when our memories...

1125
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:13,280
...will start to fade away?

1126
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,080
Sejal,

1127
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,800
you should go back.

1128
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,800
Why?

1129
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,440
All hell will break
loose, Sejal.

1130
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:05,440
Harry, let all hell break loose.

1131
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:40,960
Not like this.

1132
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,040
I can't behave the way I do
with the others. On the sly.

1133
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,480
Not with you.

1134
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,560
Harry...

1135
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,520
You think I'm better
than the others?

1136
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:20,960
I know you do.

1137
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,160
If there was someone
else in your place...

1138
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,280
...what would they have done?

1139
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,960
You're wrong about who
you think you are.

1140
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,400
Perhaps that's the lie.

1141
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,200
Sometimes I think
you can save me.

1142
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,720
I'll save you.

1143
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:07,760
Like an ember it will burn...

1144
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,600
...this memory of ours.

1145
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:23,040
Stinging and singeing
this memory of ours.

1146
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,880
Good morning!

1147
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,760
Mayank sent tickets
to Frankfurt.

1148
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,120
Very good.

1149
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
You asked him?

1150
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,400
Don't worry. We have 2
hours' before the flight.

1151
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,280
Why Frankfurt?

1152
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:52,200
The tour didn't go there.
Your ring can't be there.

1153
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:56,440
We'll find the ring. You're hurt.
Just rest.

1154
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,280
Should I rest? Or do
Mayank's wedding shopping?

1155
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:04,360
So what? He's getting married.
He has no family here.

1156
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,440
Don't get involved.

1157
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,720
We are going.

1158
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,000
Come here, sweetie!

1159
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,600
We'll miss the flight. Stop!

1160
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,760
It's time!

1161
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,640
Last check, final
check, all check.

1162
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,680
Let me light this, Monica.

1163
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,960
- They're here.
- It's done.

1164
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,520
Welcome!

1165
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,080
Don't they look lovely?

1166
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,200
Pomp and splendour abound.

1167
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,160
All arrangements are set.

1168
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,640
The welcome drinks are served.

1169
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,400
The wedding turbans adorned.

1170
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,680
You're looking all dolled up.
The hall is all decked up.

1171
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,040
Myriad delicacies
ready to relish.

1172
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,720
A song with a Desi beat plays.

1173
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:44,080
Our meeting is full of mischief.
Soak in the happiness, honey.

1174
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:50,440
We have everything
we need, honey.

1175
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:53,600
Let all hell break loose!

1176
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:59,200
Listen to me, honey. Let
tomorrow worry about tomorrow.

1177
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:04,720
Honey, I am all yours today.
Let all hell break loose!

1178
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,400
Let all hell break loose!

1179
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:33,160
Gone are the days of solitude.

1180
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:41,280
Now my world is
full of friendship.

1181
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:48,560
Feelings fill my heart.

1182
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:52,560
All words are now spoken. The
world has turned upside down.

1183
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:55,440
Poems recited, drinks swallowed.

1184
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,000
Delicacies all gobbled up.

1185
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:02,040
Our meeting is full of mischief.

1186
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,000
Soak in the happiness, honey.

1187
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,560
We have it all, honey.

1188
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:13,000
Let all hell break loose!

1189
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:19,200
Listen to me, honey. Let
tomorrow worry about tomorrow.

1190
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,160
Honey, I am all yours today.

1191
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:28,560
Let all hell break loose!

1192
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,080
What's the scene?

1193
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,160
I mean between the two of you.

1194
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:38,680
- Go home.
- What do you think?

1195
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,160
I think you shouldn't leave.

1196
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,680
Just stay here.

1197
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,760
Is it do-able? Any chance?

1198
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,200
(German)

1199
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,600
You look so good together.

1200
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,640
Don't you feel like staying?

1201
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,800
Don't overdo it, Manky. Go!

1202
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,320
Keep him out of it.

1203
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:10,120
I have never seen this
side of his personality.

1204
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,160
Tell me honestly...

1205
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:16,880
Do you feel the same with your
boyfriend as you do with Harry?

1206
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,360
This is too much! You better go!

1207
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:24,920
You know I didn't know this
girl was hidden inside of me.

1208
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:26,840
Really!

1209
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,120
I can't believe I'm
behaving the way I am.

1210
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:35,800
I have never felt as
happy as I feel now.

1211
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:41,280
It's a dream, it's
too good to be true.

1212
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,920
It's not real, right?

1213
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,760
My life is in Mumbai.

1214
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:59,320
My life plan. Family,
business, Rupen.

1215
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,440
I have to go back.

1216
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:17,680
We are tour guides.
We should know.

1217
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,880
Everyone goes home in the end.

1218
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,440
Everyone loves a holiday...

1219
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,680
...but holidays
don't last forever.

1220
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,520
Let's go.

1221
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,680
- Great party.
- Yeah! Good fun.

1222
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,080
Thank you so much.

1223
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,160
Tired?

1224
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:01,680
- I was waiting for this moment.
- To chill in the balcony?

1225
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,720
Exactly. That was my plan.

1226
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:09,400
How did you guess?

1227
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,200
That's just the problem.

1228
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,800
What's next? Where
do we go from here?

1229
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,360
Still looking for the ring?

1230
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,120
What's our next stop?

1231
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:45,440
Vienna?

1232
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,800
Did we go to Switzerland?

1233
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:50,920
What is it?

1234
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,840
Let's stop. We're done.

1235
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:56,680
What are we doing...

1236
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,920
...playing husband and wife?
It's a sham.

1237
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,120
Who are we kidding?

1238
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:06,040
- Let's not spoil it.
- No, we must spoil it.

1239
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,760
Stop this play-acting.

1240
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,040
What's wrong? Why are
you behaving so badly?

1241
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,480
Our time is up!

1242
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,680
We both know it.
There's no time left.

1243
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,400
And you have to leave.

1244
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,680
It's a farce, Sejal.

1245
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:27,320
Sipping wine, chilling out.
Nothing but a farce.

1246
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:40,040
- What do you want, Harry?
- What difference does it make?

1247
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:42,520
Who am I to want anything?

1248
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,880
- Answer me.
- Be practical, Sejal.

1249
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:48,360
Let's be like you.
I'm a tour guide.

1250
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:52,320
A nobody. I know
what my life is.

1251
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:57,200
I know what I can have
and what I cannot have.

1252
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:02,280
It's all right.

1253
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,840
OK, you're just a nobody.

1254
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,600
But you can have desires?

1255
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,840
I'm asking you. What
do you want, Harry?

1256
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:16,120
- That's not the point.
- Then what is?

1257
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,400
What do you want?

1258
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:22,600
Are you someone who dumps her fiancé
and elopes with a tour guide?

1259
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:27,880
Do you want to be a
bad woman like that?

1260
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,200
Do you?

1261
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,320
It stings for a bit.

1262
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,960
Then time heals everything.

1263
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,360
Keep your advice to yourself.

1264
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,160
Sejal...

1265
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,160
Sister, can't you sleep?

1266
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:14,960
You make me tense.

1267
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,080
Not anymore! Here,
talk to Rupen.

1268
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:21,960
I have called him over.

1269
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:28,280
Sejal, you've made a
mountain out of a molehill.

1270
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:30,320
Such drama over a ring!

1271
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:36,120
I'm sorry, I was very angry. I
spoke out of turn at the airport.

1272
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,000
And didn't call for three days.

1273
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:42,240
My fault. I'm sorry.
Will you come back now?

1274
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,560
Or must you be stubborn?

1275
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,400
Are you all right?

1276
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,680
Is Harry looking after you?

1277
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,840
It's ok now? You are
coming back, right?

1278
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,320
Say it.

1279
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,760
I'm coming back.

1280
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,760
Can you get me a
flight tomorrow?

1281
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:23,840
Yes, ma'am.

1282
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,200
Checked in?

1283
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:56,400
This is the
moment...when I leave.

1284
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,320
It was in my bag.

1285
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,360
I found it two days ago.

1286
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:33,400
Look after yourself.

1287
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,680
Because I won't be there.

1288
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,520
Don't worry.

1289
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,880
I'm selfish.

1290
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,360
I told you I'd leave.

1291
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:10,200
We always find what
we're looking for.

1292
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,800
I'm looking for something too.

1293
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,280
All the time, everywhere.

1294
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,200
I don't know what it is...

1295
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,280
...but it's something...

1296
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,720
...I have never found.

1297
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:46,240
Could I have been
looking for ...you?

1298
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,560
Sejal.

1299
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,080
I am empty without you...

1300
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,040
...you belong to me.

1301
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:14,080
Wherever you may roam...

1302
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:16,440
...you belong to me.

1303
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:27,720
I am empty without you...

1304
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:31,880
...you belong to me.

1305
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:05,360
How long has your name
been etched on me?

1306
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:13,200
Whatever I have has
come from you.

1307
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:21,240
You are my desire and my right.

1308
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:32,960
I am empty without you...

1309
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:36,680
...you belong to me.

1310
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,280
Now for some quality
time before we leave.

1311
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,240
I can answer all your queries.

1312
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:57,720
Anyone wants to take a pic...
a photo? I can take it.

1313
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,560
Before our long bus
journey, if anyone...

1314
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:12,000
We're heading to Liberty Square.

1315
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,400
He means the place
we just visited.

1316
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,760
Our bus leaves soon...

1317
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,440
Brother, a call for you.

1318
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:25,000
...we can't head back, but
we can go to the toilet.

1319
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,680
It happens.

1320
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:43,360
You should forget her.

1321
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,360
Why?

1322
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:51,000
Why should I forget her?
Is that necessary?

1323
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:55,080
Brother, take it easy.

1324
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,280
It was bad but it's over.

1325
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:01,800
Bad? Why?

1326
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,760
Was it bad that I met her?

1327
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,560
- Nothing better has ever happened.
- What about now?

1328
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,160
Who would have thought...

1329
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,240
...she'd be the one to
do what I had feared.

1330
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:21,120
Brash, stupid, juvenile.

1331
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:26,960
She isn't scary but she made
made my fears come true.

1332
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:31,680
She became the person
who felt like home.

1333
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:35,160
Why didn't you
tell her, brother?

1334
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:41,440
Would she have stayed? And
abandoned everything?

1335
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:43,840
You never asked.

1336
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,200
Would it have made a difference?

1337
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,040
Who knows! But you didn't ask.

1338
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:57,760
Was it right for her
to stay for my sake?

1339
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,560
It was up to her, not me.

1340
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:05,840
You should've admitted your feelings.
But you said nothing.

1341
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:14,600
She asked me three times.

1342
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:20,920
Can I ask now?

1343
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:25,240
- It's too late.
- Why is it too late?

1344
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:28,000
Why? She's getting
married tomorrow.

1345
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,240
I'll tell her
before the wedding.

1346
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:35,720
I promised I'd be
at her wedding.

1347
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:39,840
You're planning a trip to India?

1348
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,480
I'm flying tomorrow.

1349
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:45,040
What for?

1350
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:50,040
She's getting married. What will you say?
What will you do?

1351
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,040
I don't know.

1352
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,080
Marriage?

1353
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:30,120
Congrats!

1354
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,640
Harry, will you
come to my wedding?

1355
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:14,600
25 November in Mumbai.

1356
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,200
It'll be fun.

1357
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:20,280
Rupen and I look good together.
You'll see for yourself.

1358
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,200
You won't be able to.

1359
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:24,960
You'll feel hurt.

1360
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:58,320
Mind the queue.

1361
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:04,760
Hi, thank you for coming.

1362
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,280
Who are you?

1363
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,640
What do you mean? Who are you?

1364
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:15,120
- Isn't this Sejal's wedding?
- Sejal. Sejal, who?

1365
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:18,680
It is the 25th?

1366
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,040
Yes, it is. So?

1367
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,560
Sejal Zhaveri's wedding?

1368
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:27,240
That wedding got cancelled.

1369
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:29,160
That's how this
venue became free.

1370
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:32,720
Have you come for her wedding?

1371
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,720
A very happy married
life to you.

1372
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:40,600
Thank you.

1373
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,800
Thank you.

1374
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:48,840
You're here!

1375
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,120
Tea? Coffee?

1376
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:00,600
No, no.

1377
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:05,320
- Cold drink?
- No, no formality.

1378
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,520
The wedding was cancelled.

1379
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:11,920
Why?

1380
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:15,600
What happened?

1381
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:25,600
I am not a nice,
sweet, sister-type.

1382
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:31,200
I'm the type to dump my boyfriend
and elope with a tour guide.

1383
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,960
A few days after I returned,
I understood that.

1384
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,000
I'm the bad type.

1385
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:45,320
Poor Rupen is a nice sweet guy.

1386
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:50,640
I couldn't have married him,
so I cancelled the wedding.

1387
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:54,120
I've traveled so far to
attend your wedding.

1388
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,400
So...no, no.

1389
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:03,400
You'll have to get married.

1390
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:09,480
How can I get married?

1391
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:13,680
I've broken off the engagement.
I'm not even wearing a ring.

1392
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,280
Not my fault.

1393
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:17,720
What can I do?

1394
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,480
Do you have a ring?

1395
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:27,960
Let's have a romantic engagement.
We'll get married later.

1396
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:33,280
I don't have a ring. It's
a silly thing anyway.

1397
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:38,080
You lose it then you have
to look for it everywhere.

1398
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,480
But you weren't
looking for a ring.

1399
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:46,600
No?

1400
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,880
So what was I looking for?

1401
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:55,280
Something I have
that belongs to you.

1402
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:58,360
What?

1403
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:06,200
A certain void
that is inside me.

1404
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:11,320
That's what you were seeking.

1405
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:18,760
The void that's inside of me...

1406
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,840
...if you were to fill it...

1407
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:26,720
...it would complete you too.

1408
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:32,080
If we still lacked
something in our lives...

1409
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:36,560
...I know it'd be fine as
long as we are together...

1410
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,200
...but you would not
miss anything because...

1411
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,520
...this void would
fulfill you...

1412
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:56,760
...and keep you feeling
beautiful and worthy always.

1413
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:05,560
I'm ready.

1414
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,560
So how do we do this?

1415
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,600
No more rings!

1416
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:25,480
I'm not a girl on
the side, am I?

1417
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,760
Like the others?

1418
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:35,680
You can tell me if I'm worth it.

1419
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,680
So tell me...

1420
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:42,240
...and when I understand...

1421
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:32,360
Live well, even if you
belong to another.

1422
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:46,200
May the path you
take shine bright.

1423
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:52,120
The paths of yesterday
and tomorrow.

1424
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:17,760
I recall the sound
of your footsteps.

1425
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:23,360
Live well, even if you
belong to another.

1426
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:30,560
At last the bird has flown home.

1427
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:35,360
It's a new start.

1428
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:45,280
It's been years since I heard my
voice sing above the tractor sound.

1429
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:55,400
In the wheat fields...

1430
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:58,560
...that's where you'll find me.

1431
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:02,640
Walking on the simple path
with a smile on my face.

1432
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,680
Come to me!

1433
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:12,400
Hear the song of my heart.
Your yellow gold-edged veil...

1434
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:14,320
...flies over the sky.

1435
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:16,560
You bring colour to life.

1436
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:18,400
Come to me!

1437
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:27,120
I cherish your little tantrums.
I am all yours today.

1438
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,600
Fly like a beautiful
butterfly...

1439
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:33,640
...and join me in the fields.

1440
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:44,520
Today we dance,
today we rejoice.

1441
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:55,160
Fly like a beautiful butterfly
and join me in the fields.

1442
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:14,360
I feel beautiful
in the instant...

1443
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:17,440
...that I remember
that I belong to you.

1444
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:21,360
I'll shout from the rooftops...

1445
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:24,760
...that I'm crazy about you.

1446
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:28,200
I am not afraid or ashamed...

1447
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:31,320
...of teasing and
taunting you all night.

1448
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:35,200
Must you tell me all this?

1449
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:38,000
I hear you and I melt.

1450
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:41,400
Don't complain if
I sound foolish.

1451
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:45,160
I've filled my heart with
you, so don't turn away.

1452
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:51,920
Fly like a beautiful butterfly
and join me in the fields.

1453
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:55,480
Fly like a beautiful
butterfly...

1454
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:58,720
...and join me in the fields.

1455
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:02,480
Today we dance,
today we rejoice.

1456
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:37,320
Is this real or am I
just high on emotion?

1457
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:40,800
Is this real or a
game of chance?

1458
02:13:54,520 --> 02:14:00,120
What you were seeking...

1459
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:05,080
...was seeking you too.
