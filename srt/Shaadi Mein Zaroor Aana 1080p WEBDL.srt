00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:20,490
KANPUR

4
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:35,839
How are you brother in law?

5
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:37,491
Very Good..very good
Come..come

6
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,608
Food? I will also eat

7
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:39,959
Did you bring the photo?

8
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:44,229

00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:47,184

00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,439
-Please bring the paratta
-Yes uncle

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,929
Its Shukla ji's girl,
I've got all the details

12
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,514
And she's from good family

13
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:57,962
Mom used to say,"If you bring a girl,
bring from a lower status than us"

14
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:01,223
All of the house and family
will be under control, you see!

15
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:02,705
Isn't she beautiful ?

16
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:04,822
Ye..ah more beautiful, than expected

17
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:09,597
I hope she doesn't sits there doing
the makeup and I cook for her

18
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,169
No, no we are there know

19
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:14,801
You'll cook and feed your daughter in law,
I've less hope on that from you, Shanti ji

20
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,956
Yeah, why would you've any hope from me?

21
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:18,286
Show me

22
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:23,051
Daughter, you call Sattu
And tell him to see the girl on Sunday

23
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:24,208
Yes Papa

24
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:30,749
Tell me one thing, whenever meeting a girl
why do you sweat?

25
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:33,320
In ten minutes meeting
how can any one decide that,

26
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:35,956
I want to marry and spend my
whole life with this girl

27
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,061
Ok

28
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:38,973
And if the decision is wrong

29
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,677
Your whole life is gone

30
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,635
-So don't decide in ten minutes
-Then?

31
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:46,426
Lets book an expensive Mercedes,
get in it and go

32
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,786
Headlights, bumper check
everything properly

33
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,053
I'm saying, you'll make the right decision

34
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,245
Lets do one thing

35
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:55,706
I'll check the headlights, bumper,
all of your car and send it back

36
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,655
Shut up; Insolent
Shame on you, she'll be your sister in law

37
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,786
Your girl, my sister in law
and my girl ?

38
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:02,942
-Ok listen
-Yes

39
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:04,716
Don't boil eggs for me,
Today is tuesday

40
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:08,927
Friend, your eggs are defintely getting
boiled, She looks very beautiful..

41
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:12,695
I don't understand one thing; A girl
like this in Kanpur and I did not know?

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,813
Give me

43
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:15,870
Yes mom..I'll go there

44
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,398
Listen. Which clothes did you wear?

45
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,619
The pink one, which Guddy Aunt gave me

46
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:24,018
And listen wear matching earrings

47
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:27,318
Yes Mom. I've put them,
Last time also i wore the same

48
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:30,748
-Ok Mom, Listen
-Yes..tell

49
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:34,668
Talk to dad for one last time,
Maybe he'll accept

50
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,996
I studied so much and topped in MA

51
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,076
I don't want to marry so soon

52
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:42,706
I want to study some more, get a job,
become someone

53
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:44,878
And then I'll marry whoever you say

54
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,674
Talk to him for the last time and see

55
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:49,337
You know, he don't listen to anyone

56
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,416
I'm still hearing for sending
you to Allahabad to do MA

57
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,740
Now forget about studying further

58
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,784
And listen, talk to the boy properly

59
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,319
And as it is your habit, dont laugh

60
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:06,832
Be a little shy..in between

61
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,686
Mom I can't be shy and all
I'm telling now itself

62
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,938
Just as he's coming to see me
I'm going to see him

63
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,966
And if the boy is great
And If I say I don't want to marry

64
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,366
Will Dad force me to marry?

65
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,351
Aarthi dear, is there a problem?

66
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,918
What happened?
Why silent?

67
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:29,674
Yes Dad

68
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,311
Do you like any boy in the university?

69
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,289
No Dad

70
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:36,981
You are a fool! The boy is educated,
He is a clerk in the collectorate

71
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:41,933
Government work, a good home,
Much higher family status than ours

72
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:44,949
We cant find a good proposal like this
for you again and again

73
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,117
You are not going to get any IAS or PCS,
Did you understand?

74
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,233
Yes Dad

75
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:55,605
And yeah if you don't like this boy also
Jogi Uncle have found three more boys

76
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,124
Before the end of this year
You will be married, did you understand?

77
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,741
Yes Dad

78
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:02,649
So be quiet and go see the boy

79
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:03,805
Yes Dad

80
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:06,589
What happened?

81
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:08,567
Nothing

82
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,123
-Satyendr
-Aarti

83
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:21,077
Please sit...

84
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:26,447
Will you have something?

85
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,023
Yeah, I

86
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:29,119
Waiter

87
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,183
What will you have?

88
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,187
Coffee

89
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:37,491
Coffee, Two coffee..something with it?
Pastry..No..Biscuit..No

90
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:40,135
-Two coffee
-Ok sir

91
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,383
Ask..what you wanted to know,
I'm ready for the interview

92
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,939
No..its not an interview

93
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,958
Just as I've come to see you,
You've come to see me

94
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,289
You can also ask whatever you want to know?

95
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,283
To tell the truth..I feel all this so weird

96
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,396
How can anyone decide about the whole life,
in half an hour?

97
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:05,121
I also feel awkward

98
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,269
Dad said that you are in a government job?

99
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:12,372
Yes, I'm a Clerk in the Excise Department

100
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,371
I'll join from next month,
I just got hired

101
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,368
Excise Department
People of Bribery

102
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,168
Do you want to take bribe and progress?

103
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:23,196
No..no, I don't believe
in giving and taking bribe

104
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:27,544
But our system is like that if you
don't accept, Still they will give you

105
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,045
No..no I won't accept

106
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:30,505
No..You won't be able to refuse

107
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,683
-You will see I won't take
-We will see

108
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,257
-I..
-Sir

109
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,276
-Thank you
-Welcome

110
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:47,549
What are your expectations from your wife?

111
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:52,054
Wake up early and make tea for me,
When I go for bath, make breakfast

112
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:54,078
Prepare lunch box for the office

113
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:57,027
Like my mom has been doing
for my dad all these years

114
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,659
When return from the office,
get ready and look beautiful

115
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:04,314
Massage my leg at night..
I don't expect these at all

116
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:08,887
I just want a life partner
who will be my friend forever

117
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:17,453
Just who takes care of my parents
And respect them, that's enough

118
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:21,345
What are your expectations
from your future husband?

119
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:25,866
Dad never gave me permission to work
I was always a topper since childhood

120
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,698
I expect that my husband
Give me permission to do a job

121
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,378
You studied a lot, your
education should not be wasted

122
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:35,719
It's good if you've a job,
we'll have double income

123
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:38,550
Then I won't have to take bribe

124
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,882
I have one more expectation,
but it's a difficult one

125
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,571
You just tell me

126
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,359
I expect my husband to take me to
see cinema every week

127
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,481
-You love cinemas?
-Soo much

128
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:55,237
Then every Sunday we will watch
evening show in Sangam Talkies

129
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,504
-Promise ?
-Promise..

130
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:06,518
So now what?

131
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:09,598
Choose a finger

132
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,710
This ? I'll call parents in the evening
And say yes for the wedding

133
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,766
Did you like me that much?

134
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:23,647
Me...Anyone would have liked you..

135
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:26,903
 Unless you like someone else?

136
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,354
I'll also call my aunt in the evening

137
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:37,167
Can I say something?
You look really pretty in pink

138
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:39,355
Thank you

139
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:43,664
Satyendr...what was the second finger?
That inside you...

140
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:48,410
O that ! Instead of evening
I'll go to the bathroom now itself

141
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:50,286
And call them to tell I want to marry

142
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:55,540
Can I say something if you won't get upset?

143
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,236
Say it, I'll never get
upset about anything you say

144
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,382
It's not Aakward..
It's is Awkward.

145
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:06,530
Haa? Did I say Aakward?

146
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,875
Ok..Leave it..Anyway we are getting
married, Now nothing will be aakward

147
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,011
Awkward

148
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:20,220
Aww..Aww
Aw...kward...Kbard

149
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,429
Not Kbard...Awkward

150
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,666
Ok..I understood
I'll learn it slowly

151
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,894
Uncle..Greetings

152
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,784
-Come here
-Yes

153
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:30,938
Excellent..

154
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:33,994
If you want to respect, Do it right
Don't act

155
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:36,622
Come, touch again

156
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:39,728
Haa..come here
Blessings!

157
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:43,207
Now tell.. How is the preparation
of your competition going on?

158
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,594
Going good...with your blessings

159
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:46,935
-What'll blessings do?
-Greetings Aunt.

160
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,608
Father is dying in darkness
and son is power house

161
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm hungry....Come..come

162
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:55,036
Ancestors died selling utensils
And son wants to be an officer

163
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,961
If your son wants to do something
then support him, dear

164
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:03,789
Once he becomes a magistrate or collector
Your seven generations will be improved

165
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:07,985
-Dad, next year I will clear 100%
-O..really?

166
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:10,370
If I'm busy selling utensils at the store,
How will I study?

167
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:12,386
I need to focus a little know

168
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,447
Son, I'll set your focus

169
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,873
You come home

170
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:20,265
Aunt, I told Aarti to attempt it

171
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:23,334
Last year she topped in MA
She'll definitely top PCS

172
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:26,093
Should I do one attempt on your face?

173
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:37,052
These IAS, PCS are not for girls
Don't give wrong suggestions to sisters

174
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,248
That proposal is very good for Aarti

175
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,699
So brother in law,
when are we going to Misrah ji's home?

176
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,683
-They've called there tomorrow at 3 o'clock
-Hmm

177
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:51,003
Stand here at sharp 2 o'clock
Don't be late

178
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,735
Brother in law, you make my arrangement,
I won't go anywhere

179
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:57,885
You'll not change..right?

180
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:03,636
I talked to Mahish Tomorrow few people
will come from Shukla ji's family

181
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:05,474
OK

182
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:10,886
-Shanti
-Hmm

183
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,003
I talked to Sattu

184
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,410
We both decided that
We won't take dowry

185
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:23,446
If we wont take dowry,
How will the wedding happen?

186
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:24,954
What do you mean by that?

187
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:29,072
Means will you be able to find Poonam,
A family who doesn't take dowry

188
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:31,272
No...right?

189
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,836
How can the wedding take
place without dowry?

190
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:35,890
We can't save much from your job,

191
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,868
to find an officer's proposal for Poonam

192
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:40,918
and we didn't create this custom

193
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:44,485
Whatever will come in Sattu's Wedding,
We will fix and give it to Poonam

194
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:46,950
Poonam's wedding is after two years

195
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,275
Well, Dowry will be twice after two years

196
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:54,118
Ok, leave it
You drink the milk, it is getting cold

197
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:58,149
I told Mahish, he'll come at 2:30

198
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,379
You won't say anything
Someone should be there to talk sensibly

199
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,108
Drink the milk and sleep

200
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,423
You and sister had already thought upto 12,

201
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:15,254
I'm saying, as boy and family are very good

202
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,639
If it's extended till 15 also,
We shouldn't lose this proposal

203
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:23,078
No, we can only afford 12 and,
We'll do it in 12

204
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:24,727
You don't talk there

205
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,087
25 lakhs

206
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:34,047
Is there 25 lakhs now a days? No, my nephew
can't get married...in lesser than this

207
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:42,356
Shall we go brother in law?
Let's go

208
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,816
Wait..Let me talk
We have come here to talk know

209
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,910
Mishra ji, we have a small plot in Kanpur

210
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:52,543
It will be sold in 3 or 4 lakhs

211
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:58,307
Some we have saved in Aarti's name,
Rest I'll take personal loan from the bank

212
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,868
We want this weddding to happen

213
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,405
Why are you embarrassing me?

214
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:09,337
Give what you wish..its a custom, which
is followed since ages or else we would...

215
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:14,396
Brother in law..just a minute
I'm here know...I'll talk

216
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:21,818
See..my nephew is the only son
And the only heir of this house

217
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,641
And now he has a government job,
In excise department

218
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:31,417
And here my brother in law is a professor,
In the university for 30 years

219
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,925
-What are you..
-So they have the standard to ask...right?

220
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,021
Yeah

221
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,500
When we get the money we wish,
Then we'll agree for this wedding else no..

222
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:40,120
Sorry sir

223
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:43,591
No matter how much you make us count,

224
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,266
If we double the amount also
it doesn't make 25 lakhs

225
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,995
Is your maths weak Jogi gi?

226
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:51,338
What?

227
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,780
-We've 40 lakhs offer....40 lakhs
-Oho..

228
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,005
It's because our Sattu liked your daughter

229
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,058
Otherwise we won't have taken,
a rupee less than 40 lakhs

230
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:04,130
It's true

231
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,006
You said so we stopped and waited for you

232
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:09,002
Otherwise tonight we would
have finalised another party

233
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,099
Sister where is their number?
Where is my phone?

234
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,686
Come on brother in law, in the evening
another party is coming, with 40 lakhs

235
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:16,960
Let's go now

236
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:18,283
I told you don't talk too much

237
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,905
Mishra ji you're wise and
you've seen the world

238
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,816
You can understand the
capability of a man like me

239
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,414
I'm definitely in a BDO's post

240
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,820
But for me till today a single
rupee of bribe is immoral

241
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:37,939
You please, tell what
is your final wish?

242
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:39,486
Shukla ji I am...

243
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,414
Shukla ji we can understand your capability

244
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:44,928
This wedding can't be
possilbe in less than 25 lakhs

245
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,768
Do you understand?

246
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:49,740
18 is cash, 7 lakhs worth goods

247
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,718
And this is our final decision

248
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:55,004
My brother in law and my
sister also thinks the same,

249
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,603
This wedding can't be
possible in less than this

250
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,890
Now can we go....? Brother in law

251
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:17,753
Mishra ji...I accept it,
I'll respect your wish

252
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,466
Why're you folding hands?
Shanthi ji give sweets..

253
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,994
Now we're a family
Congratulations..

254
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,462
You're cleverness and
attitude only works on me

255
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,266
Mishra ji I'll respect your wish

256
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,973
Now from where will you
bring the extra 13 lakhs

257
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:38,930
We won't get a good boy in
less than this..anywhere

258
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:43,460
Before retirement I'll take
loan and repay it slowly

259
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:50,865
At least my daughter will get a home
she likes, Thinking that....I said yes

260
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,278
Can I say something?

261
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:24,174
In pink you look like Juhi Chawla

262
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,291
In every color you look like Shahrukh Khan

263
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,343
Really?
Shahrukh Mishra

264
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:35,854
Let's go

265
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,144
Let's go

266
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:59,034
You be the streets of Varanasi
So I can wander till night in you

267
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:10,331
You be the streets of Varanasi
So I can wander till night in you

268
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:16,158
You talk like the savoury chaat
Your eyes are like the Ganges

269
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:23,394
I'll sleep near to it
And In the morning wake up in you

270
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:28,582
You be the streets of Varanasi
So I can wander till night in you

271
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,598
You be the streets of Varanasi
So I can wander till night in you

272
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:11,469
Every Sunday, in Sangam Talkies
we'll watch movie, The night show

273
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:20,864
Like in movies, there will be a day
When I'll be your hero

274
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:28,453
Every Sunday, in Sangam Talkies
we'll watch movie, The night show

275
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:34,052
Like in movies, there is a day
When I'll be your hero

276
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:39,942
Entertain you, dance and
Romance only with you

277
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,326
I'll stay in your heart like happiness

278
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,682
So when you smile, my reflection is seen

279
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,814
You be the streets of Varanasi
So I can wander till night in you

280
00:19:53,261 --> 00:20:01,061
You be the streets of Varanasi
So I can wander till night in you

281
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,282
Can I say something?

282
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:11,306
I was never so happy in my life,
As happy as I'm now by marrying you

283
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:14,420
Me too

284
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:22,953
Shall I drink coffee from your cup?

285
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,294
So where will we go for the honeymoon?

286
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,510
Haa?

287
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:48,599
For honeymoon?

288
00:20:54,601 --> 00:21:01,673
I want to go to a cold place...like Masoori

289
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:03,418
We should go to Masoori

290
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:05,346
Okay, We'll go

291
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,967
I also have a secret wish

292
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,108
What?

293
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:14,759
With my husband once I want to....

294
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,444
Yes

295
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,363
I want to get drunk

296
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:27,247
I never drank, but I saw in the movies
and it seems to be so much fun

297
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,668
I saw how hero makes heroine drink,
And he too gets drunk

298
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:34,939
Then they have so much fun
I want to do exactly the same

299
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:44,747
And if husband is your best friend

300
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,389
You can trust him...Right?

301
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:52,433
Absolutely..
Secret..

302
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,374
Choose one finger..this ?

303
00:21:58,212 --> 00:21:59,289
-We'll drink Bhiskey
-What?

304
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,464
We'll drink Bhiskey

305
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,216
What is Bhiskey?
It's whiskey

306
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:09,307
Yeah, we'll drink that
I feel intoxicated now itself

307
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:11,792
What was the second finger?

308
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:14,929
Barandy

309
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,075
It is not barandy...It is brandy

310
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,730
Staying with you, I'll become a foreigner

311
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:25,420
You do one thing..come home soon
Fix everyone's English

312
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:27,520
I'm tired of teaching them

313
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,724
What?

314
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,389
Really, did I say barandy?

315
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:33,128
Yes Satyendr

316
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:37,639
See, you call me Sattu

317
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,664
Those who love me, call me Sattu

318
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:49,285
See who's here...my beloved niece

319
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:51,044
-Uncle..
-Where is your husband?

320
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,421
O Dad..He is so busy
He'll come on the wedding day

321
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:56,219
Now I am here

322
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,919
Any work, Anytime
Tell me I'll never do it

323
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,623
You'll not find this
anywhere else in the market

324
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:06,100
-The bra is already attached in it
-Yes,its already attached

325
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,735
This is very petty..Its fitting is
excellent Sir, these can be worn together

326
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,789
There are colors other
than these, look

327
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:14,165
No sister...this is beautiful

328
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,605
If she've decide,she'll buy
bra and panties in pink color

329
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,036
-Neelam
-No, that you can but in any color

330
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:20,150
It won't be needed

331
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:21,661
Sister? you say whatever you please?

332
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,733
How much more time...?
I'm feeling ticklish...

333
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:29,041
Aarti will rub and change
the size of your shoes

334
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,689
Its my wedding you have to do pedicure

335

Aunty, promise by God you wear it..
You'll look exactly like Madhubala

339
00:23:49,936 --> 00:23:51,351
If Dad sees us, he'll kill us

340
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,573
You also have one

341
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:53,595

342
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:56,953
Ranjan

343
00:23:58,505 --> 00:23:59,567
Round...round...stop

344
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,443
No not from my plate
Dad...

345
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:04,297
It's very delicious

346
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:07,348
-Which one?
-Lets finalize this red one

347
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:08,635
Aarti loves it too

348
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:12,619
Dear, Red color is for girls
My son won't wear red

349
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:40,174
Excellent..

350
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:42,374
Your husband is a clerk and
Mine is a junior engineer

351
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,703
Mine is expert in licking
And yours will make you lick

352
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:45,803
Sister...

353
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:46,850
I meant the sole

354
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,732
Does brother in law
know, you smoke so much?

355
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,375
I don't hide anything from him..Aarti
And he doesn't hide from me

356
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:54,251
We're best friends and You also
don't hide anything from your husband

357
00:24:54,382 --> 00:24:55,439
No..I won't hide

358
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:56,534
I already told Sattu

359
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,823
That I want to get drunk
with him during honeymoon

360
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,049
Aha? You are two steps ahead of me
And what did Sattu Sir say?

361
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:07,396
He is more excited than me
He has never drank in his life

362
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:10,485
Sister...He is so cute

363
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:14,080
Aarti...I've learned two things from
wedding Which is the most important

364
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:17,579
-What sister?
-A lot of sex and a lot of money

365
00:25:17,762 --> 00:25:18,814
Sister...You talk anything

366
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,323
I'm saying the right thing

367
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,924
What a timing! He is amazing..

368
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,297
It feels like without talking to you
He can't even go to loo

369
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:31,643
Chee.. Sister

370
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:33,535
Put it in speaker, let me hear what he says

371
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:35,170
Speaker? in front of you...
Am I crazy?

372
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,233
I know what he would say,
You put on speaker dear..

373
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,677
You won't say anything..ok?

374
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,742
I won't say anything

375
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:43,657
Hi

376
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:44,786
Happy Birthday

377
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,962
You remember?

378
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,439
Yes, I remember everything about you

379
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,962
Is it?

380
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,358
Well...Listen wife, I want to meet you

381
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,288
In the temple at the main
bus station,

382
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,594
Tomorrow meet me there,
there's a room behind it

383
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,672
There we can meet each other easily

384
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:02,068
I'll give you...

385
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,613
Why will we meet in a room?

386
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:07,580
You don't misunderstand by the word 'room'

387
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,900
Everything will happen at
home only after marriage

388
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:16,294
I didn't see you for many days
I just want to see you

389
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,962
Without you, its even difficult to breathe

390
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,838
I'll not come
Ok, tomorrow evening 4 o'clock

391
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,881
Hey Sattu...hello

392
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:35,000
I love him, what a romantic boy
Move...Move

393
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:37,557
Well, from 2 things one is set in your life

394
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:42,006
Your sex life will be great
This boy will always be on you

395
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:43,266
Sister...

396
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:45,143
-And now I'm imagining it also
-Chee..sister

397
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,746
But Aarti there is one problem..

398
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,135
What?

399
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,082
In the matter of money,
I think he is a miser

400
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:53,382
Why?

401
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:57,251
You think about this... Do anyone
call his would be wife to the temple?

402
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:59,088
There are so many five star hotels

403
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:01,239
He could 've boooked a room there,
And gazed at you

404
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,583
What'll he do in temple?
Make you ring the bells

405
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:06,809
I don't know about all that,
but I'll reach there before 4o'clock

406
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:10,155
Poor thing can't even
breathe without me...know?

407
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,096
I'll be the oxygen
And fix it up until the wedding

408
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,101
But you remember one thing
Don't let him touch you

409
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,953
You know boys are bastards

410
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:21,749
First he'll do something,
Then he'll doubt your character

411
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,102
I'm telling you

412
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:24,339
Yes...My lord

413
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:58,897
Happy Birthday to you

414
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:09,226
Thank you Sattu..You did all this for me?

415
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:13,580
This is nothing.. I wrote
something for you, Shall I read?

416
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,709
Poetry?

417
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,008
Yes, shall I read?

418
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:20,267
Juhi, Madhuri, Divya Bharati
You are beautiful than them, My Aarti

419
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,242
You're laughing? Is it bad?

420
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,475
No..Its lovely...Pls read

421
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:30,282
You're my destination, You're my dream
You're God's most beautiful idea

422
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:34,412
Now my only intention is to,
love you more than myself

423
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,652
Sattu. How's it?

424
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,594

Thankyou

426
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:48,329
This rose....pink color suits you so much

427
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:51,044
What do you think..
Why did I wear pink color?

428
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,837
O....For me?

429
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,318
For what else?

430
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:58,066
There are flower petals

431
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:05,730
I'm in love with you
Shall I say 'I love you'

432
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:10,342
It is your choice

433
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:15,106
Ok I'll say
I love you

434
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:20,911
Now your turn

435
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,730

436
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:30,234
Say it....say it know
Its so small, say it

437
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:35,961
I won't say, I'll say everything
after the wedding only

438
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:42,512
Ok then, I wanted to ask you something?

439
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:43,878
Please ask

440
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:45,978
If you won't feel bad?

441
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:52,843
Shall I kiss?
Shall I kiss u..

442
00:29:58,786 --> 00:30:00,178
Will you kiss in the temple?

443
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,743
God is everywhere

444
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:05,610
Right ji....If you invited me to
a five star, Maybe I would have

445
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:08,943
One moment

446
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:17,666

00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:28,222
Why, now you don't feel like it?

452
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,229

00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:32,621

00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,607
Only once

458
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,436
Move....you'll kiss and then doubt me

459
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:54,519

Mother Promise...I won't

462
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,829
Now everything, after the wedding

463
00:30:58,846 --> 00:30:59,933
I won't doubt

464
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,282
Its just one day Sattu, Bye

465
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,217
I won't doubt

466
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,457
Sattu just wait for a bit

467
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,633
Tomorrow we'll meet at our wedding

468
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,475
The sky is bright with many stars

469
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:40,223
When you shine like a moon in me

470
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:49,242
The sky is bright with many stars

471
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:55,553
When you shine like a moon in me

472
00:31:55,889 --> 00:32:01,326
I'll be so near to you,
that I'll be your feeling

473
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:06,125
Dear, come I'll live in your every breath

474
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:12,642
You set like evening and rise like dawn

475
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:20,289
I'm walking by your shadow,
I'm with you...I'm with you

476
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:26,581
Now my only intention is,
to love you more than myself

477
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:34,090
I promise by my heart,
I am with you...I am with you

478
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:44,862
I'll spend my day and night for you

479
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:50,384
When you sleep, I'll watch you all night

480
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:02,325
You are so much dissolved in me

481
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:07,689
That if I walk in the crowd
without you, I'll feel lonely

482
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,403
In any mirror I look

483
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,905
I only see you

484
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,186
I also became your face

485
00:33:18,828 --> 00:33:23,956
Now my only intention is,
to love you more than myself

486
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:31,625
I promise by my heart,
I am with you...I am with you

487
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:42,105
Your love kites fly in my chest

488
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,120
I fly in the wind and be your veil

489
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:59,499
I'm soaked with you in your rain

490
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:04,532
When your hair is spread,
I'll be your cloud.'

491
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,508
Your dark eyes are my sea of dream

492
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:14,971
I got down and lost in them

493
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:24,804
Now my only intention is, to love you
more than myself, I promise by my heart

494
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:32,835
I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you

495
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,956
Brother...Bride groom
Wake up, wake up

496
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,255
Can't you wake me up after two minutes?

497
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:43,571
Tomorrow onwards, when sister
in law will wake you up,

498
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:44,638
Lets see what you'll do?

499
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:45,773
Go from here

500
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:47,223
-Get up mom is calling

501
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,127
See, my mehendi...in your name

502
00:35:02,744 --> 00:35:04,685
Now your name is written in my life

503
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:06,864
Well, I'm yours in this life

504
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,386
Why only in this life?
I'm yours in every single life

505
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:15,961
Choose a finger

506
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,528
Right one

507
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:18,847
Its 'I love you'

508
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:20,392
What's the second one?

509
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:22,184
I love you very very very much

510
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,433
Did Haldi(ceremony) start?

511
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,583
Yes, we were waiting you

512
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:57,300
Did you apply?

513
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:00,854
Yes, Brother is full yellow in color

514
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:04,104

00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,672
You're looking nice

518
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:21,956
Sister...Mom is inside

519
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:23,890
Ranjan ji..

520
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:27,962

531
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:50,420
My Sister in law's son is an RTO in Indore

532
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:53,833
Last year we went there
It is a high status

533
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,754
Government job has its own grandness

534
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:56,955
Yes, exactly

535
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,570
Now our Sattu also has a government job

536
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,849
Its Ok know Aunty, Sattu
has a government job

537
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:05,322
And Aarti also want to
work after the wedding

538
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:10,342
She is very lucky Aunty that you allowed,
My husband's family did not allow me

539
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,146
Allowed? Who said so?

540
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:20,482
Aunty, Sattu and Aarti talked about it

541
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,521
Dear Sattu is a kid,
He will say anything in excitement

542
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:26,193
I buy his underwear till now

543
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:28,937
See Abha dear

544
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:30,897
The brides of Mishra family don't work

545
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,835
It's our tradition, what will people say?
We live with daughter in law's money?

546
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:41,466
Till today daughter in law of our
family didn't work, And they never will

547
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:44,058
At least not until I'm alive

548
00:37:44,506 --> 00:37:48,091
And about government job,
I am the goverment of this house

549
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,071
When Aarti comes and
take care of this house,

550
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:52,047
Let her think this as a
government job, right?

551
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,224
-Mommy
-Give

552
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,686

00:37:57,123 --> 00:37:58,630
Eat, son

00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,470
Sattu...here Aarti sister in law

556
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:19,278
Hello

557
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,525
I am very nervous
I'm feeling very weird

558
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:24,116
What happened?
I'm here...don't worry

559
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,090
Listen...Send me your photo in bridal dress

560
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,618
There should be some suspense know..Sattu

561
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,634
Please send..I want to see you

562
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:33,731
Surely you'll see,
Today I'm looking very hot

563
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,150
Why suspense anymore?
Now we are almost married

564
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,605
Stop it brother

565
00:38:38,844 --> 00:38:39,972
I'm coming to take you

566
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:41,520
Bye

567
00:38:41,744 --> 00:38:45,477
Shall I beat you? Are you out of your mind?
You are a fool

568
00:38:46,196 --> 00:38:47,522
I was just talking in the phone

569
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:49,924
You could have told me
you wrote PCS mains exam

570
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,664
What is there to talk about it?

571
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:54,055
There's nothing to tell...are you crazy?

572
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:56,351
If it's all done..
Can I talk?

573
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:00,520
Aarti you cleared the PCS main exam,
You can be an officer

574
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:06,860
Your results came just now,
I saw online

575
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:11,950
Me...an officer?
Sister, I passed

576
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,231
Party!

577
00:39:20,545 --> 00:39:23,564
People try for ten years and,
they don't get selected

578
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,613
Me and Ranjan are trying for
two years and we fail everytime

579
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:29,065
And this girl hit a four in the first try

580
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,774
I hit a sixer not four

581
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:33,940
Not sixer Madam...
You scored a century

582
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,347
Aarti think, you'll have your
own mansion, Car with blue lights

583
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:40,560
And the servants saying "Yes Maam"

584
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,710
A big job in UP state, your
own office in Sachivalaya

585
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:46,777
And So much respect
that you can't even bear

586
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:50,029
Now, you'll be told
"Yes Maam", Officer Shukla

587
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:54,976
Not Officer Shukla...fool
I'll be Officer Aarti Satyendra Mishra

588
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,961
I can't even believe it
Sister, I'll be an officer

589
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:01,760
Sattu is so lucky for me

590
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:07,171
Wedding is the happiest day of everyone's
life and it's double celebration for me

591
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:09,894
Sister....

592
00:40:39,302 --> 00:40:42,254
Baraat (Groom's family) will come now
Hurry up...keep it near the gate

593
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,415
-Dad, one minute
-What is it?

594
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:46,592
-They are coming
-I want to talk an important thing

595
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:48,150
Do not get angry...please listen

596
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:51,213
Ok, Your husband mustn't have arrived.
I knew it...Where did he reach?

597
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:52,324
-Dad it's...
-Listen

598
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,247
Baraat is coming
Put on your coat soon

599
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:55,903
You also get ready

600
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:57,278
Dad listen,
Please don't get angry

601
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,329
What happened?

602
00:40:58,384 --> 00:40:59,760
Tell me quickly...there's no time

603
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:03,009
Aarti wrote the pre exam
of PCS and she passed

604
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:07,005
Then wrote the main exam and passed
in it also. She didn't tell us, dad

605
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:09,360
She passed the PCS exam

606
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,944
Yes Dad
Online results came

607
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:19,321
Well, this is a very good news
Aarti is ready....right?

608
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:20,632
Baraat is coming

609
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:24,805
Dad, You're not listening..,she has cleared
PCS main exams. She can be an officer

610
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,839
From today, Aarti is Mishra
family's daughter in law

611
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:33,106
What will she do or not do,
Will be Mishra ji's decision. Ok?

612
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:36,921
Are you ready to welcome them?

613
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:41,166
Mom...tell him,
We are making a big mistake

614
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:42,195
They will arrive soon

615
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:44,051
Aarti's mother in law won't let her do job

616
00:41:44,112 --> 00:41:46,718
By getting her married to this family,
We are making a big mistake

617
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:48,579
By telling your Dad also,
Nothing will happen

618
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:50,281
Mom at least you listen

619
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,538
Manju tell her to be quiet and go inside

620
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:55,912
Today its the wedding day,
Don't make me do something wrong

621
00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:58,065
Dad...I know you're angry,
but think once with cool...

622
00:41:58,154 --> 00:42:03,478
Don't talk nonsense,
otherwise my hand will rise

623
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:05,822
What are you doing?
She is our guest

624
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:10,049
If you say one more word....

625
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:13,128
I'll say Dad, why shouldn't I say ?

626
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:14,220
Be silent please..

627
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:15,324
What do you want?

628
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:18,286
Do you want Aarti to do cooking, like
me and mom and look after babies?

629
00:42:18,547 --> 00:42:20,180
Shouldn't she try once to be an officer?

630
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:22,312
She passed the mains in the first attempt

631
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,974
She is very talented,
Why are you destroying her life?

632
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:26,089
Why shouldn't I say ?

633
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,559
Because of people like
you and her mother in law

634
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:30,162
Girls are sitting inside the house

635
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:32,864
What do you want me to do?
Hear your nonsense and stop the wedding

636
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:35,288
Shall I tell Mishra ji that my
daughter can be an officer..

637
00:42:35,383 --> 00:42:36,935
So I want to stop this wedding

638
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:39,385
Yes Dad, stop the wedding

639
00:42:39,983 --> 00:42:43,670
She can marry later,
But she can't be an officer afterwards

640
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:46,232
Her mother in law said she
won't allow her to work

641
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:49,647
She always wanted to do a job, Dad
Please stop this wedding

642
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:52,714
-Abha quiet..
-Manju, this girl is crazy

643
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:56,555
Take her away from me,
Otherwise I'll kill her

644
00:42:56,891 --> 00:42:58,151
Something wrong will happen

645
00:42:58,234 --> 00:43:01,396
You are doing wrong Dad,
with Aarti's life

646
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:03,520
Abha, Be quiet

647
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:07,189
-Am I doing wrong to Aarti's life?
-No, she didn't mean that

648
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:11,925
Listen carefully dear, you're married
Let your sister get married

649
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:14,010
Don't try to be chief of
this house, understand?

650
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:15,429
Mom please explain it to him once

651
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:16,539
Enough!

652
00:43:16,562 --> 00:43:21,066
Enough. Pack your bags and go

653
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,536
We will complete the
wedding without you, Go

654
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:25,300
Dad just once

655
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:26,369
Go from here

656
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:28,624
What are you doing? Dear wait..

657
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,149
-What happened sister?
-You come here

658
00:44:13,152 --> 00:44:15,379
Just now I sent a message to Sattu
Is every thing fine?

659
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:16,643
What happened?

660
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,369
Listen carefully, to what I say

661
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:20,203
Today morning I went to your in law's house

662
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,093
I told your mother in law that,
Aarti wanted to do a job after marriage

663
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:24,331
She completely rejected it

664
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:26,686
And said Daughter in law of
Mishra family does not work

665
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:28,937
How can she say that?
Sattu himself told me

666
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:32,159
Yes, I said you talked to Sattu about it
Did you know what she said?

667
00:44:32,591 --> 00:44:36,151
Sattu is kid and she still buy his
underwear. Do you know what this means?

668
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,863
She didn't say this to me,
She wanted you, to know

669
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:43,387
That you definitely can't
do job when you are there

670
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:44,987
Forget about PCS

671
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:47,475
But Sattu told me

672
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:49,425
What will happen with Sattu's words?

673
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:53,997
He can't speak a word in front of his
mother. Now you decide, what do you want?

674
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,651
Sister...I can't be a housewife

675
00:44:58,097 --> 00:45:01,988
I want to marry Sattu
But in our first meeting itself

676
00:45:02,471 --> 00:45:04,206
I told him I wanted to work
And he accepted

677
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,247
I can't be a housewife

678
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:10,382
I will talk to Sattu once...

679
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:12,717
Why are you saying
Sattu...Sattu like a parrot?

680
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:13,899
He is going to be my husband

681
00:45:13,966 --> 00:45:15,101
He is a clerk

682
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:20,417
When you become an officer,
25 clerks like Sattu will work under you

683
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:24,129
I'm not saying that he is a bad guy.
He is very good..

684
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,707
But even if he wants to, he
can't understand this, Aarti

685
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:36,663
What will I do now?

686
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:38,237
What will I do....means?

687
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:41,093
Look at me, father in law,
mother in law, husband, children

688
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:43,609
And three meals of the day,
which nobody cares

689
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:49,517
And on other side..respect, freedom and
your self earned living. Think of it, Aarti

690
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:51,894
Your future is calling you

691
00:45:52,456 --> 00:45:54,789
Think of it...why did
your results come today?

692
00:45:54,983 --> 00:45:56,875
It could've come tomorrow,
after your marriage

693
00:45:57,694 --> 00:46:02,027
You could have done nothing but
now you can. Go from here, just go

694
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:04,967
I'll call my husband

695
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:07,603
He'll handle everything
You go to Varanasi with him

696
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,314
I can't do this to Sattu

697
00:46:36,738 --> 00:46:38,036
Can you do it to yourself?

698
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,880
I and my husband
are with you, you go

699
00:46:42,278 --> 00:46:44,862
Nobody will listen to
you Go from here...

700
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:49,796
Dear, you first become an officer,
Dad, Sattu...everybody will give in.

701
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:52,441
Aarti

702
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:16,058
What do you want, dear?

703
00:47:24,748 --> 00:47:25,812
Dad, Sattu

704
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,906
That I'll take care

705
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:30,758
Do you want to be an officer?

706
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,534
Then go away

707
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,582
There is no other way, dear

708
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:43,649
The society is like this,
Value their boys more

709
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,562
But don't value their girls

710
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,620
And doesn't give them the life they want

711
00:47:50,156 --> 00:47:52,435
That's why whenever a girl gets the chance

712
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,860
She must keep her head high
and live life on her terms

713
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:59,277
She should cross all the sea of fire and go

714
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:03,004
Go dear, Go

715
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,818
Aarti, leave now, Baraat is at the door

716
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,730
I have to go down so that
no one suspects and come

717
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,622
I can't do this sister,
Dad will kill me

718
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:31,732
Aarti, Uncle said he'll take
care of everything..right?

719
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:35,882
Just keep in mind that Uncle will say,
That you heard about dowry and ran away

720
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,048
Sister, what wrong did Sattu do?
He loves me very much

721
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,870
You will get love again in life

722
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:43,576
But this opportunity won't come again,
Go..

723
00:48:43,577 --> 00:48:45,435
Can I talk to him once please..?
Only once..

724
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,895
No Aarti...Not now,
and don't talk to him until I say

725
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:51,490
If they come to know why you ran away

726
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,992
They'll put all the blame on you

727
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:54,124
Come now

728
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,926
Abhaa, Baraat came

729
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:12,424
Come, Let's welcome them

730
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:14,466
Mom

731
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,090
Brother in law is waiting at the back
You go now..

732
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:35,745
Go, go.
Good luck

733
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:12,342
Congratulations

734
00:51:12,578 --> 00:51:13,667
To you too

735
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:32,342
Where is Aarti?

736
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,039
Where is Aarti?
I'm asking you something

737
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:41,655
She didn't want to marry, Dad

738
00:51:42,856 --> 00:51:44,764
She didn't want to, or
you didn't want her to?

739
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:46,248
What are you doing?

740
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:47,599
Beating your married daughter?

741
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,902
Go from here,
Go away

742
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:53,970
If not beat her...what should I do?
Worship her?

743
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:58,578
Please don't hit her...why
are you hitting her ?

744
00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:00,549
Baraat is here

745
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:07,902
Tell me where did she go?
She must have told you..

746
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:15,286
I do not know Dad, sorry Dad

747
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:23,182
Educate her more

748
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,839
Send Allahabad to study

749
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,994
You can't even look after a young girl?

750
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:34,295
Why did you invite her?
It's because of her...

751
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:39,374
Uncle, why are you scolding sister?
I didn't pass till now

752
00:52:39,434 --> 00:52:41,630
At least Aarti has passed

753
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:45,999
If I can, I would have choked them

754
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:49,469
And burn myself

755
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,219
Don't say so...

756
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,916
She has disgraced us..
What will we do now?

757
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:09,206
Come here

758
00:53:12,662 --> 00:53:14,550
I can understand your pain

759
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:19,110
It is a hard time, But we
must somehow break it out

760
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:22,518
See don't think of the world

761
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:27,558
Just think about the 18 lakh cash, we gave.
What will happen to it?

762
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:31,312
Now you tell me what to say

763
00:53:32,036 --> 00:53:34,916
Sorry Mishra ji, we made a mistake
Forgive me, our daughter ran away

764
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:42,634
Put our money in an envelope
and give it back, Like this?

765
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:46,703
That's it Sir!
You don't understand

766
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:50,653
Once Mahesh hears our daughter
ran, he won't give us a rupee back

767
00:53:51,385 --> 00:53:53,806
All the savings of your life will go

768
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:02,914
So how will we get the money?

769
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:05,035
Sister it won't,
We must get it out

770
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:12,359
Brother in law, I'm begging you,
let me handle this from here

771
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,077
Just keep quiet in front of them

772
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:21,699
We will drink tea later

773
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:25,259
First, tell us what's the matter?
Why did you call us here?

774
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:33,943
Mishra ji, the thing is
there's a big problem

775
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:36,937
For us and for you also

776
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,416
-Problem?
-Yes

777
00:54:39,165 --> 00:54:40,623
Jogi ji, What is the issue?

778
00:54:41,238 --> 00:54:44,062
The thing is that, Aarti

779
00:54:44,853 --> 00:54:45,965
What happened?

780
00:54:47,053 --> 00:54:50,005
Son, when we checked,
she wasn't in her room

781
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:51,877
Not there....means?

782
00:54:52,085 --> 00:54:53,556
There was only this letter

783
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:55,978
Take it

784
00:54:56,742 --> 00:54:57,885
You look

785
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:06,063
When our daughter came to know that,
You've asked 25 lakhs as dowry

786
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:09,631
She decided not to get married

787
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,418
She left the wedding and went

788
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:13,547
Where did she go?

789
00:55:13,566 --> 00:55:15,033
Dear, how do we know where she went?

790
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:16,223
Let me to talk to her

791
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:18,780
She isn't answering our calls,
How do we make her talk to you

792
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:19,970
Shukla ji, how's it possible

793
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,155
Everything was fixed with
the consent of both sides

794
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:23,323
You are right

795
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,762
I know it's not the matter of dowry

796
00:55:25,848 --> 00:55:27,019
I'm sorry, Sattu

797
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:30,029
I haven't told you one
thing, I attended PCS exam

798
00:55:30,054 --> 00:55:32,787
Today it's result
came and I passed in it

799
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:34,459
I'll be an officer

800
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:36,811
She went to study in Allahabad

801
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:39,167
Maybe she had an affair there

802
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:43,184
The girl ran away, disgracing the family
Did you understand?

803
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:47,359
Buy lots of charcoal and put
it on your faces, understood?

804
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,278
-Put a brake on your tongue, Mahesh
-Or else

805
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:50,330
What will I do?

806
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:57,803
I don't want to talk to you
Look Mishra ji, you are educated

807
00:55:58,404 --> 00:56:00,108
I am folding hands and requesting you

808
00:56:00,562 --> 00:56:03,996
Now our daughter doesn't want
to be related to your family

809
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:08,629
So, return our 18 lakhs, in peace

810
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:13,161
And go back with respect

811
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,844
This wedding is canceled

812
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:16,789
Is this train ticket? wedding canceled?

813
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,313
Your girl ran away
and you want money from us?

814
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:22,769
Shame on you, Is it a joke?
We will not return you a rupee

815
00:56:33,943 --> 00:56:36,111
We'll not return a single rupee
You come, let's go

816
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,193
Are you crazy?

817
00:56:38,843 --> 00:56:41,531
Don't think about leaving
without returning the money

818
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:42,650
What will you do?

819
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,051
Chandu, Keshav
Come here

820
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,524
Hey Ranjan, Take the gun

821
00:56:52,457 --> 00:56:54,195
You'll shoot, then shoot us..

822
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,455
18 lakhs, until I don't
count each and every rupee

823
00:56:58,643 --> 00:57:03,741
You aren't going anywhere,
Shoot him

824
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:05,649
I'll shoot Dad

825
00:57:05,661 --> 00:57:06,749
Shoot

826
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:09,310
I'm not afraid of you
Come...shoot

827
00:57:11,072 --> 00:57:12,856
Mishra ji...sit silently

828
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:15,993
And till you don't
return it with your hands

829
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:18,217
You're not going anywhere,
did you understand?

830
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:20,590
One minute, what are you doing dear?

831
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:24,363
Leave it
I'll get your money

832
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:28,220
But my Dad and Uncle shouldn't be harmed

833
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:33,157
I'll take and come

834
00:57:54,626 --> 00:57:57,898
Aarti

835
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,810
Did you see Aarti?

836
00:58:00,015 --> 00:58:01,110
No

837
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:06,602
Aarti

838
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,535
Sister, where is Aarti?

839
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:24,250
I called her many times, she
isn't answering. Where is she?

840
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:30,202
Take everyone with you and go home

841
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:32,234
What?
What happened Sattu?

842
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:33,536
I'll tell you later

843
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:34,931
-What happened brother?
-Sattu

844
00:58:37,502 --> 00:58:40,158
I'm sorry Sato
I haven't told you one thing

845
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,439
I attended PCS exam

846
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:44,529
Today it's result came and I passed in it

847
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:46,038
I'll be an officer

848
00:59:27,532 --> 00:59:28,731
Sattu

849
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:39,242
What happened?

850
00:59:44,817 --> 00:59:49,314
-Dad...Uncle
-Nothing

851
00:59:49,472 --> 00:59:52,644
Nothing Mom...Don't cry

852
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:54,548
Save them

853
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,989
Where did you put the money?
I've to give it to them

854
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:04,796
8 lakhs has been spent, 10 lakhs is there,
you take it and bring them with you

855
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:07,364
That's not enough, they want the full cash

856
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:08,788
We'll give them later

857
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:10,396
They won't agree

858
01:00:11,946 --> 01:00:14,359
At this time from where
will we bring the money?

859
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,106
I kept it for Poonam's wedding

860
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:45,446
I wore this in my wedding

861
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:54,407
That girl will be cursed,
She made our life hell and went

862
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,116
Hello sister

863
01:01:04,722 --> 01:01:07,746
Yes, they just went
They returned Dad all the money

864
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:09,582
Is Dad fine?

865
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:12,283
No, But uncle is sitting with him

866
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:16,115
I'll stay here for two days,
Until things get better

867
01:01:16,683 --> 01:01:18,882
Did Sattu call you?

868
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:23,730
Yes, many times, but you
said so, I didn't answer

869
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:27,556
Sister, can I call him once please?

870
01:01:28,395 --> 01:01:30,922
Yes, talk to him once. He is very sad

871
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:34,723
We made one mistake
His heart broke

872
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:37,369
I saw him

873
01:01:49,995 --> 01:01:51,635
Stop the car

874
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:57,954
Where is he going?
Sattu see..

875
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:00,362
Brother in law

876
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:06,515
Dad, Dad

877
01:02:07,883 --> 01:02:12,802
I won't die, son
I'm not so weak

878
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:18,170
I was not feeling fine

879
01:02:18,658 --> 01:02:19,706
Open the button

880
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:21,139
Stop, one minute

881
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:33,654
I don't feel like going home
We were to go with the bride, right?

882
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:43,387
What will do at home?
See your mother's tears?

883
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,974
Everyone will be watching us

884
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,328
See it's..

885
01:02:51,595 --> 01:02:59,565
Jugal Kishore Mishra,
whose son's wedding...

886
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,952
It's very embarrassing, dear

887
01:03:31,489 --> 01:03:38,396
What are you saying?

888
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:45,429
Satyendra
Please take it

889
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,960
We won't leave them
Don't worry, don't worry

890
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,945
5 years later

891
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:23,556
In support of builders and developers,
We started a single window program

892
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:26,660
With which you won't have
to do double effort

893
01:05:27,134 --> 01:05:30,100
So I hope you would invest in our area

894
01:05:30,884 --> 01:05:32,985
This will be beneficial for you and for us

895
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,612
Ask me, if you have any questions

896
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,028
Neelam, how many times did I tell you,
Don't knock. Come in, straight

897
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,861
And I've told you many times,
Here you are Senior and I'm Junior

898
01:05:52,724 --> 01:05:57,049
Look, I tried PCS exam five times,
But I did not succeed

899
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,030
But you passed in the first attempt

900
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:03,694
Aarti, I'm very thankful to you

901
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,182
Today I've a job because of you

902
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:08,647
Otherwise, I would be
teaching in a school in Kanpur

903
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:10,679
-Shut up...will you drink tea?
-Tea?

904
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,986
Compliments with tea...That's nice

905
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,845
Two teas please

906
01:06:18,744 --> 01:06:22,368
I heard something from the office.
Is it true?

907
01:06:22,776 --> 01:06:24,478
It depends on what you heard

908
01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:26,046
Now don't act

909
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,883
The whole office is talking about one thing

910
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:29,532
What?

911
01:06:35,547 --> 01:06:37,198
What are you doing? I didn't look

912
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:39,070
You didn't look
You were peeping

913
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,942
If you peep too much, you will fall off
You've put on weight

914
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:44,111
When brother in law is loosing..
He gets violent

915
01:06:44,153 --> 01:06:45,252
Yes naughty

916
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:47,682
Dad, Neelam called
She said maybe Aarti will get a promotion

917
01:06:47,734 --> 01:06:50,173
That's a very good news
Congratulations brother in law

918
01:06:50,379 --> 01:06:51,476
Come Ranjan

919
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:52,650
It's tea time

920
01:06:52,844 --> 01:06:54,622
Tea's here...Bring it here Sister

921
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:56,118
Keep it there, Ranjan

922
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,223
I'm very grateful to God

923
01:06:58,832 --> 01:07:01,719
Aarti made a lot of progress in 5 years

924
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:05,606
Now if her marriage gets fixed,
I'll be at peace

925
01:07:05,966 --> 01:07:07,717
Stand up
Stand up

926
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:09,530
Why?
What happened?

927
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:12,252
Turn around..turn
Wipe your sari

928
01:07:12,886 --> 01:07:13,998
What happened ?

929
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:16,395
Her needle is stuck at
Aarti's marriage for 5 years

930
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:18,474
I thought if I find it,
I'll move it a little

931
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,116
I'll give you one

932
01:07:23,922 --> 01:07:25,194
Yes Uncle, play

933
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,562
Mom, why are you cheating?

934
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:32,322
When did I cheat?

935
01:07:32,524 --> 01:07:33,528
-She cheated
-You cheated

936
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,273
If Sonu is saying then
you must have cheated

937
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:37,851
Dad, did I ever cheat?

938
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:39,945
-Sometimes you do cheat
-Tell him to go

939
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:41,580
Ranjan, you take him from here

940
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,516
Oh, you in the middle of the game...

941
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,368
Sister you come

942
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,483
Come Manju

943
01:07:47,515 --> 01:07:51,366
Come, Uncle's nephew
I think you were born for me, Let's go

944
01:07:57,212 --> 01:07:59,283
Manju it's your turn

945
01:08:00,764 --> 01:08:03,500
Abha, when are you going to Aarti's place?

946
01:08:03,919 --> 01:08:05,556
I'm thinking to go, day after tomorrow

947
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,528
Miss Aarti Shukla,
You're temporarily suspended from your job

948
01:08:11,624 --> 01:08:14,328
For transferring the 90 acres of land,
behind the Barabanki railway

949
01:08:14,353 --> 01:08:16,548
To the name of Kukareja and sons

950
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:19,145
You are charged, for
taking bribe of 3 crores

951
01:08:21,219 --> 01:08:22,973
Sir you've known me all these years

952
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:25,125
Do you think...I can
do something like this?

953
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:27,741
Aarti..It's not about,
what I think is right or wrong?

954
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:31,654
Point is that,Yesterday in department
enquiry also, Everything was against you

955
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,780
And now official enquiry has begun,
which ADM finance is assisting

956
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:37,300
And DM sir has himself started this enquiry

957
01:08:38,173 --> 01:08:40,509
They have asked you to go
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock

958
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:43,299
Yes sir

959
01:08:52,558 --> 01:08:54,951
Good Morning Sir

960
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:21,613
Miss Aarti Shukla, is that your name?

961
01:09:22,143 --> 01:09:23,338
Sattu

962
01:09:26,183 --> 01:09:28,258
Are you calling a senior
IAS officer by his name?

963
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:32,995
What's your post?

964
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:41,107
I am the sub-registrar

965
01:09:43,384 --> 01:09:44,502
How many years?

966
01:09:44,886 --> 01:09:46,071
Four years

967
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,802
You are just born and already
started taking bribes?

968
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:53,270
Do you want to progress taking bribes?

969
01:09:54,174 --> 01:09:57,215
No but it's Ok, you are part of the system

970
01:09:57,655 --> 01:09:59,534
So there's no problem in getting bribed

971
01:09:59,551 --> 01:10:00,783
Right?

972
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,879
-It's not like that,
-Did I ask you to sit?

973
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:21,964
Sir, I'm innocent,
I can explain

974
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:25,033
You don't have to explain anything,
Aarti Shukla

975
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:27,098
You've done, what you wanted to do

976
01:10:31,088 --> 01:10:32,988
Now I'll do,what I've to do

977
01:10:35,257 --> 01:10:38,633
And for the mistake that you committed,
You'll surely get the punishment

978
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:43,236
Job suspension and six years of jail

979
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,960
When found guilty..

980
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:53,208
When or If?

981
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:56,895
When I declare you guilty

982
01:10:58,447 --> 01:11:00,737
Satyendr, Please listen to me once

983
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,246
Sir

984
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:13,169
Hats off to you, Brother in law
You were watching her for 4 years

985
01:11:13,654 --> 01:11:16,933
Now at the right time, requested minister
and took the case under your control

986
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,167
What do you think?
Is she guilty?

987
01:11:20,718 --> 01:11:22,111
It doesn't matter to me

988
01:11:22,854 --> 01:11:25,103
I just know she is guilty for one thing

989
01:11:25,303 --> 01:11:26,875
And I will punish her for that

990
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:31,654
There are many hell in this world
I'll send this Aarti Shukla there

991
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,792
Everything is fair in love and war,
Priyansh. Love is over, Now war begans

992
01:11:50,248 --> 01:11:51,348
Be happy

993
01:11:51,652 --> 01:11:52,807
What happened?

994
01:11:52,853 --> 01:11:53,932
Eat sweets

995
01:11:53,968 --> 01:11:55,597
Why are you so happy...What is the news?

996
01:11:55,653 --> 01:11:56,745
See this

997
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:58,616
What is it?

998
01:11:58,686 --> 01:11:59,765
Just see it

999
01:11:59,955 --> 01:12:01,508
Why are you showing me her photo?

1000
01:12:01,673 --> 01:12:02,723
What happened?

1001
01:12:02,724 --> 01:12:06,300
Madam was being very dignified,
and was against dowry

1002
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,948
Ran away from the wedding
Now lets see how she'll escape

1003
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,099
Why..what happened?

1004
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:11,407
Soon she'll be imprisoned

1005
01:12:11,782 --> 01:12:12,851
Prison...Why?

1006
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:14,044
For bribery

1007
01:12:14,378 --> 01:12:17,479
Not a small bribe,
3 crores

1008
01:12:17,732 --> 01:12:18,763
3 crores

1009
01:12:18,891 --> 01:12:20,364
She'll be fully stuck...

1010
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,377
You sweeten your mouth brother in law

1011
01:12:22,794 --> 01:12:24,348
Yes, we should eat sweets

1012
01:12:24,852 --> 01:12:31,019
Okay, I'm eating. It's Lucknow's news,
Sattu is also there

1013
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:32,812
I tell him. He'll be happy

1014
01:12:33,269 --> 01:12:34,407
Yes tell him

1015
01:12:38,374 --> 01:12:40,334
-Greetings Mom
-I have a very good news.

1016
01:12:40,507 --> 01:12:42,088
What happened?
Am I going to be an uncle

1017
01:12:42,236 --> 01:12:43,281
No..better than that

1018
01:12:43,856 --> 01:12:47,121
The Shukla ji's good girl,
Who ran from the wedding

1019
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:50,555
Now she is caught,
Charged for taking 3 crore as bribe

1020
01:12:51,786 --> 01:12:53,586
She'll go straight to prison

1021
01:12:54,234 --> 01:12:55,689
You are also in lucknow,
Ask about it

1022
01:12:56,737 --> 01:13:00,164
Mom, I'll call you later
Greetings

1023
01:13:00,569 --> 01:13:01,645
Ok

1024
01:13:13,962 --> 01:13:14,989
Hey Poonam ji

1025
01:13:15,673 --> 01:13:18,143
How much did Sattu ask that his
bride ran from the wedding?

1026
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:23,195
I'll marry you without dowry.
What do you say?

1027
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:28,090
Hey..Where are you going?

1028
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,198
Hey Sato, Don't get upset, friend

1029
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:38,689
Listen Mahesh,
She didn't go because of dowry

1030
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:42,311
She went to become a PCS officer

1031
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:46,837
And 25 clerks like Sattu will work for her

1032
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:50,745
She doesn't care for people like Sattu

1033
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:21,359
What you filled in my heart,
You will see that poison

1034
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:28,030
You'll suffer my pain,
The Havoc of my curse

1035
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:34,482
Now you'll see the result
of your selfishness

1036
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:43,510
You rejected my love,
You will now see my revenge

1037
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:04,058
The answer to my love was cruelty,
You gave this meaning

1038
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:10,588
You weren't forced,
But still you betrayed me

1039
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:17,138
You will see my hatred,
Morning and night

1040
01:15:17,856 --> 01:15:23,768
You rejected my love,
You will now see my revenge

1041
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:40,324
You've done all this atrocities,
Keeping something in mind

1042
01:15:40,968 --> 01:15:46,672
At last, God gave you punishment,
For your wrong doings

1043
01:15:47,498 --> 01:15:53,160
The whole world will see
your defeat in public

1044
01:15:54,005 --> 01:15:59,943
You rejected my love,
You will now see my revenge

1045
01:16:02,172 --> 01:16:04,191
You've done nothing, still he
broke the whole house

1046
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:08,408
Now he became IAS so will he do anything...
And he'll raid wherever he wants?

1047
01:16:10,397 --> 01:16:11,497
-Bindu
-Yes sister

1048
01:16:11,558 --> 01:16:12,720
Bring a glass

1049
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:14,259
He has taken this case purposely

1050
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,948
Is it not clear, he has come
to take revenge from her?

1051
01:16:17,427 --> 01:16:20,091
Why would we be afraid when
Aarti has done nothing?

1052
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:22,628
Because we can't do anything

1053
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:26,777
Every power is in his hands,
He told her that he'll send her to jail

1054
01:16:27,847 --> 01:16:28,959
You are badly trapped

1055
01:16:29,735 --> 01:16:31,991
Showing professionally but,
He's taking personal revenge

1056
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:36,113
Sister, now you tell
what she should do?

1057
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:46,873
Aarti, Why are you crying?

1058
01:16:47,817 --> 01:16:48,961
Everything will be alright

1059
01:16:49,145 --> 01:16:51,745
Drink water,
Everything will be alright

1060
01:16:57,987 --> 01:16:59,103
Aarti, You do one thing

1061
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:01,218
Apologize to him

1062
01:17:01,749 --> 01:17:05,093
He loved you so much,
Maybe he's very angry because of that

1063
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:09,038
Maybe he'll forgive you,
I heard that he didn't marry yet

1064
01:17:10,237 --> 01:17:14,229
You meet him somewhere outside the office
Or invite him for coffee

1065
01:17:24,446 --> 01:17:27,860
Maam sit, I'll call Sir

1066
01:18:02,008 --> 01:18:03,072
How are you?

1067
01:18:03,164 --> 01:18:04,373
How can I help you?

1068
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:10,393
Listen I'm really sorry

1069
01:18:11,113 --> 01:18:12,309
For what?

1070
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,706
For what I did to you

1071
01:18:15,832 --> 01:18:17,168
I still regret

1072
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:21,874
Dowry was just an excuse,
I had written PCS exam.

1073
01:18:22,217 --> 01:18:23,329
Will you drink tea?

1074
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:28,299
Ashok....Ashok

1075
01:18:30,599 --> 01:18:31,628
Yes sir

1076
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:32,794
Bring two cups of tea

1077
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:36,181
So what were you saying?

1078
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:45,250
I had written PCS exam and
result came on our wedding day

1079
01:18:47,741 --> 01:18:52,605
I was confused,
I send you a message also

1080
01:18:53,945 --> 01:18:56,993
My sister said your family,
won't allow me to work

1081
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:00,359
And I didn't think what's right or wrong?

1082
01:19:02,011 --> 01:19:03,963
Yes

1083
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:08,435
I know I've been cruel to you, I hurt you

1084
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:11,779
I want to apologize to you from my heart

1085
01:19:14,685 --> 01:19:16,989
I understand why you are so angry with me

1086
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:20,094
But what will I do now?

1087
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:23,933
If you were so sorry,
Why didn't you try to meet me?

1088
01:19:25,843 --> 01:19:27,593
How many times did I call you that night?

1089
01:19:29,235 --> 01:19:31,055
I thought we loved each other

1090
01:19:34,259 --> 01:19:37,763
And now when your case is in my hands,
You realized your mistake?

1091
01:19:40,954 --> 01:19:42,226
And if I didn't come here

1092
01:19:42,595 --> 01:19:44,507
You would have never
thought about me, right?

1093
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:53,267
You were practical then, and you are
practical now but you have become more hot.

1094
01:19:55,934 --> 01:20:03,017
Officer Aarti Shukla,
Very tempting, desirable

1095
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,242
Excuse me?

1096
01:20:05,321 --> 01:20:06,951
Are you feeling awkward?

1097
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:12,596
You've come looking so beautiful
that Himalaya will also melt, Right?

1098
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,778
So let's do the thing
for which you came here

1099
01:20:17,194 --> 01:20:18,398
Shall I shut the door quickly?

1100
01:20:18,872 --> 01:20:22,087
Satyendr, Please don't talk like this

1101
01:20:22,448 --> 01:20:23,578
What ?

1102
01:20:24,346 --> 01:20:26,610
Stop talking to me this way

1103
01:20:27,898 --> 01:20:33,451
Ok then tell me,
How should I talk to you?

1104
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:46,288
Look at yourself ! Have you
come here to seduce me

1105
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:50,200
Come on, I'm ready.....come

1106
01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:51,716
Satyendr

1107
01:20:53,179 --> 01:20:56,232
Listen Miss Aarti Shukla, if you
think after seeing your beautiful face

1108
01:20:56,584 --> 01:20:59,128
I'll forget the disgrace
of me and my family

1109
01:20:59,696 --> 01:21:00,763
It would never happen

1110
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,540
And you also should never forget this

1111
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:07,665
Please don't make this personal, Satyendr

1112
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:10,596
It is personal
Its very personal

1113
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:15,068
This betrayal of your's, I'll never forget

1114
01:21:16,836 --> 01:21:18,311
This is the biggest fight of my life

1115
01:21:19,177 --> 01:21:23,554
And yes, I'm not angry
I hate you

1116
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:27,909
Now, get the hell out of here

1117
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:29,823
-Satyendr
-Get out

1118
01:21:31,142 --> 01:21:34,767
-I'm sorry
-Get out, move

1119
01:21:41,186 --> 01:21:45,904
Miss Shukla, from now on
Don't wear pink and come in front of me

1120
01:21:47,392 --> 01:21:48,712
It feels disgusting, Go

1122
01:22:00,385 --> 01:22:01,583

01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:05,329
Yes say

1124
01:22:06,404 --> 01:22:10,408
Sir this is Aarti Shukla's father's pass
book and this is her personal pass book

1125
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:11,855
-Is this personal?
-Yes

1126
01:22:12,976 --> 01:22:14,032
And that builder Kukareja?

1127
01:22:14,456 --> 01:22:15,768
Sir, He has a lot of businesses

1128
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:17,944
And connection with great politicians

1129
01:22:18,376 --> 01:22:20,433
He bought this land to
build a factory there,

1130
01:22:20,712 --> 01:22:22,752
He is in London now,
And he'll be back by next week

1131
01:22:23,276 --> 01:22:24,297
Who arranged this deal?

1132
01:22:24,476 --> 01:22:27,655
Yes, I did it.
Sir this is my job

1133
01:22:28,249 --> 01:22:29,892
Did they have the documents of the land?

1134
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:32,588
Yes sir, without documents
How can anyone sell the land?

1135
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,246
And where is the owner?
Shifted to America...

1136
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:36,393
Yes sir

1137
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:38,264
And it's clear that you
don't have the number

1138
01:22:38,323 --> 01:22:39,401
No sir

1139
01:22:39,764 --> 01:22:40,948
Any Address?

1140
01:22:41,245 --> 01:22:42,475
Here! Where else would I be?

1141
01:22:43,065 --> 01:22:44,718
I came at 9 o'clock
It's five o'clock now

1142
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,943
Did you eat anything?

1143
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:47,663
No, only if I go outside know..

1144
01:22:48,423 --> 01:22:49,455
I'm not allowed to move

1145
01:22:50,113 --> 01:22:51,210
Take care,
Bye

1146
01:23:04,116 --> 01:23:05,781
Ok Listen, I'll call you back

1147
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:12,912
Yes sir, I talked to her

1148
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,019
Tomorrow at about 9 o'clock in
the morning and I'll meet them

1149
01:23:16,106 --> 01:23:17,107
Madam Tomorrow 9 o'clock

01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:18,729
I'll talk and see what happens

1151
01:23:22,771 --> 01:23:23,963
Where were the photos taken?

1152
01:23:27,283 --> 01:23:30,050
Sir, this is when we
went to visit the site,

1153
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:32,670
The same plot which Mr. Kukareja bought

1154
01:23:33,081 --> 01:23:35,881
You physically went and checked,
Where is the land and how much is it?

1155
01:23:35,919 --> 01:23:38,935
And then on purpose transfered the
government land, To the name of Kukareja

1156
01:23:38,942 --> 01:23:41,255
No sir, I really didn't know

1157
01:23:44,993 --> 01:23:46,032
Who is this guy?

1158
01:23:46,617 --> 01:23:48,457
This is Mr. Kukareja's CEO

1159
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,313
Mr. Saigal, you must
have bought lots of land

1160
01:23:50,397 --> 01:23:51,536
Yes

1161
01:23:51,575 --> 01:23:54,452
This land which you all
bought, its market value

1162
01:23:54,477 --> 01:23:57,353
Is about 15 crores. For
how much did you buy?

1163
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:59,628
Actually Sir, the thing is that..

1164
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,173
6 crores

1165
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:03,035
Yes

1166
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:07,755
15 crores worth land in 6 crores
Then you got direct profit of 6 crores

1167
01:24:07,965 --> 01:24:09,052
Six

1168
01:24:09,092 --> 01:24:10,869
3 crores you gave to Aarti Shukla, right?

1169
01:24:14,893 --> 01:24:16,034
Is this your friend?

1170
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:18,750
No Sir
I only know him professionally

1171
01:24:18,998 --> 01:24:20,513
He also gifted you a car

1172
01:24:21,304 --> 01:24:27,502
Sir, he bought it in my name
and gifted me on my birthday

1173
01:24:28,093 --> 01:24:29,710
I sent it back, But he didn't accept it

1174
01:24:30,146 --> 01:24:33,222
Sir, Its still parked in my car park
I did not use it at all

1175
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:34,835
Umesh

1176
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:35,926
Yes sir

1177
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:37,553
Have anyone gifted you a car?

1178
01:24:37,633 --> 01:24:38,769
No Sir, Never

1179
01:24:38,838 --> 01:24:39,914
Never?

1180
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,040
No Sir

1181
01:24:41,124 --> 01:24:43,947
They're also officers.
You are very special

1182
01:24:46,568 --> 01:24:49,015
This land was registered, three
days after your last birthday

1183
01:24:49,696 --> 01:24:53,462
Of course, when you're in the system,
It's hard to say no

1184
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,620
You believe so, right?

1185
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:00,460
Kukareja ji, you are
such a big industrialist

1186
01:25:00,485 --> 01:25:01,544
Yes Sir

1187
01:25:01,815 --> 01:25:03,972
You didn't verify the documents,
It's impossible

1188
01:25:04,424 --> 01:25:08,168
Only your officers would've known that,
Its government property

1189
01:25:08,799 --> 01:25:10,415
I'm just guided by the documents

1190
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,608
The documents of the land was correct,
So I bought it

1191
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:14,916
Are you sure?

1192
01:25:15,008 --> 01:25:17,847
I'm pretty sure Satyendr,
Aarti won't take bribe from anyone

1193
01:25:18,584 --> 01:25:20,404
I think you had a confusion

1194
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,355
Did I ask you for advice Mrs.Neelam Gupta?

1195
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:26,448
No sir

1196
01:25:27,688 --> 01:25:28,855
Who is this?

1197
01:25:29,296 --> 01:25:30,528
Sir,This is Aarti's friend

1198
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,056
Not your's ?

1199
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:35,528
How can big people like these my friends?

1200
01:25:36,325 --> 01:25:40,014
It's that Aarti used to take me to
the parties, So I would go with her

1201
01:25:41,574 --> 01:25:42,758
What does your husband do?

1202
01:25:42,942 --> 01:25:44,106
Sir, He is  a school teacher

1203
01:25:44,676 --> 01:25:46,128
How much do you both earn together?

1204
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:47,829
What would I earn in this, Sir?

1205
01:25:48,284 --> 01:25:50,284
I just get my commission

1206
01:25:51,018 --> 01:25:55,078
Kukareja Sir said that she 'll
handle the things in government

1207
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:57,162
Sir, What is my fault in this?

1208
01:25:59,558 --> 01:26:02,894
Look it's your right, Aarti
The Investigation Officer can be changed

1209
01:26:03,517 --> 01:26:06,301
If you want to, But in my opinion.
Don't do it

1210
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:09,422
Because as far as I know,
DM is a good guy

1211
01:26:10,001 --> 01:26:12,905
The other officer who'll
come instead,

1212
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:16,201
Don't have a good reputation regarding
women. So I leave it to you

1213
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:21,564
Let's meet CM sir and then
we'll decide what to do

1214
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:24,012
Listen. Tell Sir, I'll eat and come

1215
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:31,785
Good Afternoon Maam, Pramod Singh

1217
01:26:34,338 --> 01:26:36,699
Maam, I know you from college
I was your senior

1218
01:26:37,402 --> 01:26:38,709
How can i help you?

1219
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:42,163
Maam, Tell me how can i help you?

1220
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:48,296
Whoever is your Investigation Officer,
I'll make deal with him

1221
01:26:48,705 --> 01:26:53,340
He'll prove you innocent,
But for that you've to...

1222
01:26:57,923 --> 01:27:03,807
I am her Investigation
Officer, Make the deal

1223
01:27:03,973 --> 01:27:05,020
Sir, I don't know him

1224
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:06,797
-Do you know her?
-Yes Sir

1225
01:27:06,843 --> 01:27:07,851
-Is she your friend?
-Yes

1226
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:12,244
She'll surely go to prison,
Atleast for six years

1227
01:27:12,997 --> 01:27:14,294
What is your name?

1228
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,000
Pramod, Sir

1229
01:27:16,494 --> 01:27:19,448
So I'll send you both together,
To keep company

1230
01:27:21,246 --> 01:27:22,629
Take it

1231
01:27:28,397 --> 01:27:29,533
Write a letter for me

1232
01:27:31,369 --> 01:27:36,053
Greetings Mom and Dad

1233
01:27:37,813 --> 01:27:39,077
Aarti Shukla's Enquiry

1234
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:42,890
Write

1235
01:27:44,654 --> 01:27:47,585
Aarti Shukla's Enquiry is going well

1236
01:27:48,454 --> 01:27:49,794
All the evidence is against her

1237
01:27:52,781 --> 01:28:00,588
There is no hope of being saved
No, hope

1238
01:28:01,745 --> 01:28:05,410
Tell Mom to get ready
to make offering to God

1239
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:10,156
Ready to, make offering to God

1240
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:14,870
Aarti Shukla will surely go to prison

1241
01:28:17,388 --> 01:28:23,608
What did you write?
What is it?

1242
01:28:24,203 --> 01:28:25,853
It's sure, Full stop

1243
01:28:28,712 --> 01:28:30,847
Your's Obedient Son

1244
01:28:31,711 --> 01:28:36,361
I'll write the name
You can go

1245
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:39,853
Go and sit outside

1246
01:28:41,879 --> 01:28:43,423
Love isn't easy

1247
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:47,520
Just understand that,
It's a sea of fire and you drown in it

1248
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,114
No, I want to turn to ashes in it

1249
01:28:50,656 --> 01:28:51,928
You made a one yourself ?

1250
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:53,716
-Did you understand?
-Of course

1251
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:57,568
Listen to this, Priyansh

1252
01:28:58,829 --> 01:29:03,369
Don't you ever promise anyone,
That you'll love them more than yourself

1253
01:29:04,234 --> 01:29:05,330
This is it

1254
01:29:06,314 --> 01:29:08,877
This love and all is nonsense

1255
01:29:11,767 --> 01:29:13,956
-I want to talk to you
-Look who've come to see me

1256
01:29:17,032 --> 01:29:20,394
I dedicate the poem I just said,
To my able friend

1257
01:29:22,528 --> 01:29:23,530
Miss

1258
01:29:25,056 --> 01:29:26,200
What was her name?

1259
01:29:26,551 --> 01:29:27,920
Miss Aarti Shukla right?

1260
01:29:28,256 --> 01:29:29,376
Dedicate to Aarti Shukla

1261
01:29:30,896 --> 01:29:33,264
She is very famous, a very practical girl

1262
01:29:34,304 --> 01:29:37,773
She is the talk of the town
She was in the newspaper also

1263
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:40,114
The bribery news of 3 crores, know

1264
01:29:40,497 --> 01:29:41,578
She is the one

1265
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:44,953
Now if you had to go to prison,
Then why three?

1266
01:29:45,826 --> 01:29:48,114
At least she should have
taken 10 or 20 crores, right?

1267
01:29:48,274 --> 01:29:50,494
What happens in 3 crores now a days?

1268
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:00,092
This is Men's washroom

1269
01:30:00,172 --> 01:30:03,676
I can't tolerate this
torture anymore, Satyendr

1270
01:30:04,348 --> 01:30:08,043
I'm choking, I can't breathe
What do you want from me?

1271
01:30:08,347 --> 01:30:10,245
What would I want from you?
I'm doing my job

1272
01:30:10,486 --> 01:30:13,170
Are you doing your job,
Or using this oppurtunity for your gain?

1273
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,834
Am I using the oppurtunity?

1274
01:30:14,991 --> 01:30:16,341
-Yes
-Well, I learned it from you

1275
01:30:17,457 --> 01:30:19,062
You did it that time, now I'm doing it

1276
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:21,289
I didn't use oppurtunity
for my gain, Satyendr

1277
01:30:21,694 --> 01:30:23,566
You know how to misuse an oppurtunity?

1278
01:30:23,993 --> 01:30:25,038
How is it?

1279
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:27,620
If I scream now,
And I tell that you're molesting me

1280
01:30:28,285 --> 01:30:30,542
Satyendr Mishra IAS, my
investigating officer

1281
01:30:31,309 --> 01:30:32,502
Is asking me favours

1282
01:30:32,548 --> 01:30:33,734
That's called opportunism

1283
01:30:34,048 --> 01:30:35,091
Go and tell

1284
01:30:35,169 --> 01:30:36,657
No, I won't say

1285
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:41,292
Because I'm not like that
Not then and not now, Satyendr

1286
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:44,451
When results came, Baraat was at the door
I was confused

1287
01:30:44,724 --> 01:30:48,745
Your mother told my sister, She would
never allow me to work, so what would I do?

1288
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:53,366
So you should have talked to me
You should have trusted me for once

1289
01:30:53,522 --> 01:30:54,546
How

1290
01:30:54,642 --> 01:30:59,314
I loved you. Didn't you think once,
about me for these 5 years?

1291
01:31:01,362 --> 01:31:02,914
Now, are you showing me tears?

1292
01:31:04,723 --> 01:31:08,430
What about my pain?
And what about my parent's tears?

1293
01:31:08,805 --> 01:31:11,350
I agree, But what should I do now?

1294
01:31:12,438 --> 01:31:16,014
What can't you tolerate?
That I left you

1295
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:18,881
Haa, You couldn't tolerate the rejection

1296
01:31:20,422 --> 01:31:23,934
But for once did you think that,
If I hadn't run away

1297
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:27,125
You wouldn't have been
in this position today?

1298
01:31:27,758 --> 01:31:28,794
What do you mean?

1299
01:31:28,805 --> 01:31:30,956
If I didn't run away,
you won't have this fire

1300
01:31:30,981 --> 01:31:33,176
in your heart and you
won't be an officer today

1301
01:31:33,985 --> 01:31:37,037
And you would still be a clerk, right?
Did you ever think about it?

1302
01:31:46,354 --> 01:31:49,462
Aarti Shukla, today the truth came out

1303
01:31:50,409 --> 01:31:53,977
You wanted to be an officer and had
problem being married to a clerk

1304
01:31:54,048 --> 01:32:00,059
You feel embarrassed by that, right?
I was a lower class man?

1305
01:32:00,129 --> 01:32:01,265
I didn't deserve you, know

1306
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:04,086
You aren't understanding me,
what happened to you?

1307
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:07,186
You wanted to ride in blue lighted cars,
And I was not of your standard

1308
01:32:07,244 --> 01:32:13,036
Aarti Shukla you were always selfish

1309
01:32:14,955 --> 01:32:17,924
that's not what I meant, Satynder

1310
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:23,052
I'm talking to you
I'm not selfish

1311
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,688
Do you want to send me to prison?
Ok then send

1312
01:32:27,956 --> 01:32:31,932
Call the police, I'll go
Send me now instead of tomorrow

1313
01:32:34,836 --> 01:32:37,288
At least I'll escape
from this daily torture

1314
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:41,430
I can't do it anymore,
I'll accept that I took bribe

1315
01:32:48,446 --> 01:32:51,918
I can't do it anymore
You call now itself

1316
01:32:52,565 --> 01:32:54,173
Calm down, please listen

1317
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:55,497
What calm down?

1318
01:32:56,426 --> 01:32:58,962
You want to talk
Okay, let's talk

1319
01:32:59,522 --> 01:33:01,148
You don't know how to talk, Satyendr

1320
01:33:01,513 --> 01:33:02,709
I'll talk calmly

1321
01:33:04,338 --> 01:33:06,394
I can't really tolerate

1322
01:33:07,202 --> 01:33:09,093
I'm sorry, I got very angry today

1323
01:33:14,843 --> 01:33:17,143
I thought you would kill me today

1324
01:33:30,209 --> 01:33:34,308
-When did you start smoking?
-After you left, I was feeling insane

1325
01:33:35,024 --> 01:33:38,953
Didn't know what to do, Leave it
Those are old stories...

1326
01:33:44,314 --> 01:33:49,267
Choose a finger?

1327
01:33:55,769 --> 01:34:01,086
-If you won't feel bad, Can we kiss?
-What?

1328
01:34:02,612 --> 01:34:03,796
One kiss

1329
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:08,682
-I won't doubt your character
-No, Satyendr

1330
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:16,455
No, I won't kiss you, you'll kiss me
It should be deep and passionate

1331
01:34:20,799 --> 01:34:28,190
And then that's a five star hotel,
lets go there to spend the night together

1332
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,709
And in five star, you won't
have a problem to do anything

1333
01:34:33,809 --> 01:34:35,327
You said it, remember?

1334
01:34:36,156 --> 01:34:38,317
-You know it was a joke
-This is not a joke

1335
01:34:39,592 --> 01:34:42,310
Tonight is the price for your freedom

1336
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:46,171
Come on

1337
01:34:51,134 --> 01:34:52,460
I misunderstood you

1338
01:34:57,886 --> 01:35:00,341
Won't you ask,
What was the second finger?

1339
01:35:02,246 --> 01:35:06,588
Today is 10th, in one week. The result
of the committee will be announced

1340
01:35:06,754 --> 01:35:10,131
Send me the 3 crores you have, Bribe

1341
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:14,685
I am part of the system now,
If I refuse, still give it to me

1342
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:17,347
I didn't take the bribe,
I don't have 3 crores

1343
01:35:17,965 --> 01:35:23,381
Ask Kukareja, He won't refuse you
You know a lot of facts about him, right?

1344
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,739
Look Shukla ji
We can't help you in this

1345
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:40,541
No sister, don't say so

1346
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:46,070
Satyndar is not a kid
He know how to do his work

1347
01:35:47,169 --> 01:35:53,721
Now if its 3 crores, you've to give it.
From where will we bring 3 crores?

1348
01:35:53,918 --> 01:35:57,586
Look, we couldn't talk
then and we won't talk now

1349
01:35:58,435 --> 01:36:04,764
Once I sold my ornaments,
to save the lives of my husband and brother

1350
01:36:06,335 --> 01:36:09,100
Now you see what you can
sell to save your daughter

1351
01:36:09,661 --> 01:36:12,848
If I sell myself also,
I can't get 3 crores

1352
01:36:13,192 --> 01:36:15,090
It's your problem

1353
01:36:18,922 --> 01:36:21,138
Come Maam,
Kukareja ji is waiting for you

1354
01:36:23,709 --> 01:36:24,828
Ok I'll do it

1355
01:36:26,896 --> 01:36:28,216
Come Madam

1356
01:36:28,828 --> 01:36:35,287
I was thinking for days that I have never
seen you, But I heard a lot about you

1357
01:36:36,161 --> 01:36:40,162
Mr. Kukareja, if I am proven guilty
in this enquiry, I'll lose my job

1358
01:36:40,836 --> 01:36:43,021
My parents house will be sold
I'll go to prison

1359
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:44,696
You have to come and say the truth

1360
01:36:45,128 --> 01:36:46,700
Everyone knows the truth

1361
01:36:47,491 --> 01:36:50,180
Don't act so naive in front of me

1362
01:36:50,426 --> 01:36:51,625
You have taken 3 crores

1363
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,480
Did I take bribe? 3 crores?

1364
01:36:53,722 --> 01:36:55,619
Didn't you give it to
anyone in the department?

1365
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,820
Did you take it
all for yourself?

1366
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:00,977
You should have given a little
bit to your subordinates

1367
01:37:01,122 --> 01:37:03,378
What are you saying?
I didn't take any money from you

1368
01:37:04,128 --> 01:37:06,311
Someone from your department
must have told this?

1369
01:37:06,436 --> 01:37:08,573
Now I lost my respect
and money because of you

1370
01:37:09,293 --> 01:37:11,903
And now that you are caught so
You want to take me down with you?

1371
01:37:12,764 --> 01:37:13,956
Wow, Madam

1372
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,318
I have seen a lot of officers, but not...

1373
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:28,646
Miss Aarti Shukla is trying to
manipulate the Investigation

1374
01:37:29,058 --> 01:37:31,502
Arrest her right away
Yes, right away

1375
01:37:39,483 --> 01:37:45,248
We can't be disgraced more than this
He's taking revenge for each and everything

1376
01:37:45,845 --> 01:37:52,081
Lets try one last time
Take this, I kept everything in it

1377
01:37:52,137 --> 01:37:56,284
Go fast and save Aarti

1378
01:37:56,294 --> 01:38:00,098
Don't cry
Pray to God that they let Aarti free

1379
01:38:02,332 --> 01:38:03,671
Come Jogi

1380
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:19,407
See. I'm here where you wanted me to be

1381
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:24,940
Now your revenge is done, right?

1382
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:28,219
Happy Birthday

1383
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:33,455
This night is the best
birthday gift in my life

1384
01:38:35,157 --> 01:38:36,353
Thank you

1385
01:38:42,114 --> 01:38:43,586
Sir

1386
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:50,142
I wish I had never met you

1387
01:38:59,468 --> 01:39:04,491
These are the documents of our house
Please save our Aarti

1388
01:39:07,998 --> 01:39:10,427
I'd like to present all the
necessary proof and evidences

1389
01:39:10,452 --> 01:39:12,014
that we'll need to
reach a conclusion

1390
01:39:12,055 --> 01:39:13,603
On Miss Aarti Shukla's case

1391
01:39:14,328 --> 01:39:16,654
I'd like to seek permission
of the hon'ble Jury to proceed

1392
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:18,367
-Please proceed
-Thank you, Sir

1393
01:39:20,792 --> 01:39:22,864
I want everyone to watch
this video carefully

1394
01:39:25,471 --> 01:39:27,426
Is it written on my forehead?

1395
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,507
You'r well educated, You
took the complete 3 crores

1396
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,375
And came here again for money?

1397
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:36,716
Okay, I'll give you whatever you want

1398
01:39:37,091 --> 01:39:40,095
Just close the case that
started because of your ignorance

1399
01:39:43,989 --> 01:39:45,269
Do you want to say something?

1400
01:39:49,601 --> 01:39:50,715
No Sir

1401
01:39:51,636 --> 01:39:52,653
I have nothing to say

1402
01:39:54,249 --> 01:39:55,793
I'll accept your punishment

1403
01:40:02,148 --> 01:40:04,748
Mr.Kukareja, I'm not afraid of you

1404
01:40:05,391 --> 01:40:07,424
If I go to the prison,
I won't let you escape

1405
01:40:10,981 --> 01:40:15,333
What is this? You said she came to
settle this.. I think she's crazy!

1406
01:40:16,513 --> 01:40:19,377
She threatened to send me to prison,
We should do something about her

1407
01:40:19,745 --> 01:40:21,145
Kill her

1408
01:40:22,855 --> 01:40:27,467
Her old lover came to take revenge..
He is behind her like a hungry lion

1409
01:40:27,527 --> 01:40:29,449
And we will the prey to her foolishness

1410
01:40:30,628 --> 01:40:32,857
We have to stop their love story drama

1411
01:40:34,066 --> 01:40:36,185
Kill her today

1412
01:40:49,781 --> 01:40:52,409
Can you explain Mr. Mishra?

1413
01:40:53,484 --> 01:40:54,710
Yes sir, I can explain

1414
01:40:56,313 --> 01:40:59,065
Mrs. Neelam Gupta's husband
is a school teacher,

1415
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:01,840
And broker Rakesh
Yadav who welded this deal

1416
01:41:02,343 --> 01:41:03,943
Is her husband's childhood friend

1417
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:06,754
The information of the land,
which is unused for years

1418
01:41:06,787 --> 01:41:09,369
Mrs. Neelam takes it from the
office and give to her husband

1419
01:41:10,622 --> 01:41:13,615
Which her husband forwards
to broker Rakesh Yadav

1420
01:41:13,872 --> 01:41:17,593
Then Rakesh makes false documents,
And sells it to different business men

1421
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:19,612
Right Mr. Yadav?

1422
01:41:24,786 --> 01:41:27,833
Mrs. Neelam misuses Aarti's trust,
And gets the documents signed

1423
01:41:29,961 --> 01:41:32,610
For years, they have been
taking bribe,

1424
01:41:32,635 --> 01:41:34,884
in Aarthi Shukla's name and then
split it between them

1425
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:41,541
Mr. Kukareja surely gave 3 crores,
But Aarti Shukla doesn't even know about it

1426
01:41:43,149 --> 01:41:44,693
Because the money never reached her

1427
01:41:51,166 --> 01:41:52,396
Right Mrs. Neelam?

1428
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:55,840
Thankyou

1429
01:42:01,225 --> 01:42:03,088
The accused, please stand up

1430
01:42:05,099 --> 01:42:06,299
Thank you Mr.Mishra

1431
01:42:07,145 --> 01:42:08,305
The evidence is conclusive

1432
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:12,577
The Jury is of the opinion that,
Miss. Aarti Shukla is not guilty

1433
01:42:17,433 --> 01:42:18,521
Arrest them

1434
01:42:19,089 --> 01:42:20,265
Yes sir

1435
01:43:02,457 --> 01:43:03,606
Sir

1436
01:43:14,527 --> 01:43:19,110
Today I understood Sir,
When someone close to us betrays

1437
01:43:19,111 --> 01:43:20,279
The heart really breaks

1438
01:43:22,434 --> 01:43:25,723
Thank you, Thank you so much

1439
01:43:28,396 --> 01:43:29,631
You can call me Satyendr

1440
01:43:31,771 --> 01:43:33,311
You can join from Monday

1441
01:43:34,002 --> 01:43:35,047
Sattu

1442
01:43:38,554 --> 01:43:39,683
Saxena ji, How are you?

1443
01:43:40,027 --> 01:43:42,788
Sir, You saved Aarti by
sending her to the police station

1444
01:43:42,867 --> 01:43:44,155
Very nice of you

1445
01:43:44,347 --> 01:43:46,438
Pramod ji, Good Job

1446
01:43:46,617 --> 01:43:47,721
Thank you sir

1447
01:43:47,821 --> 01:43:49,937
OK, I'm going to Kanpur
I'll see you, when I'm back

1448
01:44:01,027 --> 01:44:02,135
Aarti is innocent

1449
01:44:14,026 --> 01:44:20,643
Listen, Satyendr sent all
the documents of the house

1450
01:44:37,812 --> 01:44:41,659
I want to be with you forever

1451
01:44:43,634 --> 01:44:47,835
I want to bear all the sadness with you

1452
01:44:49,059 --> 01:44:51,796
I want to be with you forever

1453
01:44:52,212 --> 01:44:54,252
I want to bear all the sadness with you

1454
01:44:54,715 --> 01:45:00,196
What I can't say to the whole world,
I want to say it to you

1455
01:45:03,627 --> 01:45:11,615
You are so good !
How are you "so good"?

1456
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:19,403
I want to become a crazy lover in your love

1457
01:45:20,299 --> 01:45:25,171
You are so good !
How are you "so good"?

1458
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:34,776
I want to become a crazy lover

1459
01:45:48,329 --> 01:45:49,901
-Where is Sir?
-He didn't come here yet

1460
01:45:49,981 --> 01:45:51,357
-When will he come?
-I don't know

1461
01:45:52,253 --> 01:45:56,005
I took thousands of precautions and
understood,

1462
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:57,609
You are river and I'm the water

1463
01:45:58,633 --> 01:46:03,673
You are the only path in which I can flow

1464
01:46:04,453 --> 01:46:07,121
After understanding a
hundred times, I realized

1465
01:46:07,133 --> 01:46:10,161
I'm the chapter of your story

1466
01:46:10,189 --> 01:46:14,177
Only when we join together,
We will reach the conclusion

1467
01:46:15,838 --> 01:46:20,065
Once again, one more time

1468
01:46:21,361 --> 01:46:24,528
I just want to see you

1469
01:46:24,789 --> 01:46:27,261
After all that has happened
Anybody would be effected, Aarti

1470
01:46:28,033 --> 01:46:31,508
If I was in Sattu's place,
I also won't believe in love anymore

1471
01:46:31,858 --> 01:46:32,946
Sister, you are right

1472
01:46:33,402 --> 01:46:36,549
But I feel, Sattu still loves me very much

1473
01:46:36,846 --> 01:46:38,969
If he didn't love me so much,

1474
01:46:38,994 --> 01:46:41,870
He won't have the hatred, to
be an officer and take revenge

1475
01:46:42,212 --> 01:46:45,036
Sister, Sattu never wanted to be an officer

1476
01:46:46,539 --> 01:46:49,463
The problem is that his
brain has told his heart,

1477
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,347
 Don't fall in love with her

1478
01:46:51,635 --> 01:46:53,532
Now I'll make his mind silent

1479
01:46:53,891 --> 01:46:55,816
And I'll make him hear
the sound of his heart

1480
01:46:57,276 --> 01:47:03,164
Sattu! Listen, how much will we run?
I'm tired of it

1481
01:47:04,448 --> 01:47:07,992
I ran and became a PCS officer
And you became IAS officer

1482
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,131
Stop it, I'm tired
We have to stop somewhere, right?

1483
01:47:12,751 --> 01:47:14,603
I'm going to run away
from you, Aarti Shukla

1484
01:47:15,192 --> 01:47:16,911
Stop following me, our paths are different

1485
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:20,226
What if our paths are different,
Goal is the same..right?

1486
01:47:21,593 --> 01:47:26,034
Sattu, slow down
I can't run that fast

1487
01:47:28,554 --> 01:47:29,570
Here OK

1488
01:47:30,962 --> 01:47:32,030
Thank you sir

1489
01:47:41,923 --> 01:47:42,977
One second

1490
01:47:45,306 --> 01:47:46,970
Can you drop me home?

1491
01:47:49,011 --> 01:47:50,503
Please, my car has break down

1492
01:47:53,298 --> 01:47:54,325
Sit

1493
01:47:58,678 --> 01:47:59,714
Thankyou

1494
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,178
Drop her at home

1495
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:02,745
Haa, Satyendr

1496
01:48:02,878 --> 01:48:04,164
Go

1497
01:48:13,838 --> 01:48:14,958
Where are you

1498
01:48:14,974 --> 01:48:17,594
I'll take time to reach

1499
01:48:18,086 --> 01:48:19,982
Till then you drink 1 or 2 pegs

1500
01:48:23,066 --> 01:48:24,203
I came

1501
01:48:26,718 --> 01:48:29,182
I know that you won't marry me

1502
01:48:29,909 --> 01:48:32,048
But that doesn't mean
we can't drink whiskey

1503
01:48:32,704 --> 01:48:34,328
Now wherever you are,
That's my Masoori

1504
01:48:35,177 --> 01:48:36,407
Order me a drink

1505
01:48:37,173 --> 01:48:40,388
Ok leave it, I'll start from your drink

1506
01:48:41,311 --> 01:48:42,904
It's ladies first, right?

1507
01:48:47,226 --> 01:48:48,344
Maam, Whiskey on the rocks

1508
01:48:48,497 --> 01:48:53,063
Thank you, It's sour
Nothing happened?

1509
01:49:00,272 --> 01:49:01,520
Something is happening

1510
01:49:03,067 --> 01:49:06,167
Your specs are coming in between?
May I wear?

1511
01:49:08,424 --> 01:49:10,184
-I'm looking cute, know?
-Please

1512
01:49:10,655 --> 01:49:13,776
-Maam, your drink
-Thank you

1513
01:49:15,864 --> 01:49:18,996
You know, something more is happening

1514
01:49:20,716 --> 01:49:23,616
You are Allahabad's Tom Cruise

1515
01:49:25,488 --> 01:49:27,408
Waiter, Bring one more drink

1516
01:49:27,656 --> 01:49:29,719
-Ok, I think
-Only one

1517
01:49:37,088 --> 01:49:38,192
Husband

1518
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:43,400
I want to hold your hand
And wander in the mountains of Masoori

1519
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:47,207
Please, don't joke Aarti
There are people here, please behave

1520
01:49:47,784 --> 01:49:52,827
Shall I kiss you?
One, little one

1521
01:49:54,656 --> 01:49:56,831
-She has drank too much
-Aarti

1522
01:50:30,015 --> 01:50:31,400
Sattu, Can I say something?

1523
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:34,786
I'm thankful to God for making us meet,
Under the pretext of the case

1524
01:50:35,315 --> 01:50:37,343
Otherwise I would have lost you forever

1525
01:50:47,031 --> 01:50:48,631
Sir, why do you look upset?

1526
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:52,655
No, I was upset before, not anymore

1527
01:50:54,879 --> 01:50:55,927
Let's go

1528
01:50:57,054 --> 01:51:01,383
Satyendr, Sattu wait I'm coming

1529
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:09,807
Aarti, Be careful

1530
01:51:11,933 --> 01:51:13,498
I was looking for you everywhere

1531
01:51:23,038 --> 01:51:26,847
Can I say something Sattu?
Satyendr....Satyendr

1532
01:51:29,998 --> 01:51:34,382
Can I?
I think I'm in love with you

1533
01:51:36,687 --> 01:51:39,047
Shall I say I love you?
Haa?

1534
01:51:44,423 --> 01:51:48,478
I love you so much
I want to marry you

1535
01:51:49,814 --> 01:51:51,660
Is it because I didn't send you to prison?

1536
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:54,631
I only got you out of prison now,

1537
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,340
I got you out of my heart long back

1538
01:51:57,278 --> 01:52:02,735
I agree that it was my fault, Satyendr

1539
01:52:06,474 --> 01:52:08,654
Please agree

1540
01:52:13,087 --> 01:52:14,516
Life is so strange

1541
01:52:15,864 --> 01:52:18,833
There was a time when I
crazily wanted to marry you

1542
01:52:20,537 --> 01:52:24,373
I think about you all day,
And what did you do?

1543
01:52:25,569 --> 01:52:27,541
-You ran away...
-Sattu

1544
01:52:27,638 --> 01:52:29,738
-Remember, and now see?

1545
01:52:34,619 --> 01:52:37,577
You know the day I saw my family's disgrace

1546
01:52:37,656 --> 01:52:39,816
From that day I hate the word marriage

1547
01:52:42,753 --> 01:52:46,460
And In my life, I don't want to marry you,
Or anybody else

1548
01:52:48,595 --> 01:52:50,920
You understand that, thank you

1549
01:52:52,201 --> 01:52:56,764
The color of white love, my beloved

1550
01:52:56,848 --> 01:53:01,948
There's no deceit, no cheating,
no discrimination, my beloved

1551
01:53:02,595 --> 01:53:07,989
You are equal to a hundred colors together,

1552
01:53:08,268 --> 01:53:13,402
Fire has turned into ashes, my beloved

1553
01:53:22,817 --> 01:53:28,009
The war for which you are honoured,

1554
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:33,366
I'm a soldier in that war, my beloved

1555
01:53:37,528 --> 01:53:42,563
You are so good !
How are you "so good"?

1556
01:53:43,014 --> 01:53:49,441
I want to become a crazy lover in your love

1557
01:53:54,467 --> 01:53:58,059
I want to be with you forever

1558
01:54:00,059 --> 01:54:04,459
I want to bear all the sadness with you

1559
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:10,975
What I can't say to the whole world,
I want to say it to you

1560
01:54:13,886 --> 01:54:21,830
What I can't say to the whole world,
I want to say it only to you

1561
01:54:25,322 --> 01:54:27,475
-Ranjan
-Yes sister

1562
01:54:27,512 --> 01:54:28,606
FEW MONTHS LATER

1563
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:30,710
-Are you out of your mind?
-What did I do?

1564
01:54:30,794 --> 01:54:33,598
What is this spelling?
Don't you know the name of brother in law?

1565
01:54:35,642 --> 01:54:37,687
And you wanted to do PCS, right?

1566
01:54:37,783 --> 01:54:44,590
He wrote Sharada for Sharad
Go, print it correct

1567
01:54:44,986 --> 01:54:47,442
Time goes by so fast

1568
01:54:47,899 --> 01:54:50,410
Look, how is God doing justice?

1569
01:54:50,966 --> 01:54:53,203
That girl betrayed
And he is sitting here unmarried

1570
01:54:54,723 --> 01:54:58,666
Have you promised yourself that,
we'll die without seeing our grandchildren?

1571
01:54:59,152 --> 01:55:03,673
Now that girl is getting married,
Do you want to play with her children?

1572
01:55:03,921 --> 01:55:05,617
Why will he play with her children?

1573
01:55:05,889 --> 01:55:07,028
Of course you're right

1574
01:55:07,146 --> 01:55:09,646
How long could Shukla ji,
keep the girl unmarried?

1575
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:11,284
She have to get married some day

1576
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:13,815
I am not refusing her to marry,
I'm telling him

1577
01:55:14,646 --> 01:55:17,622
Son, Let me be a grandmother before I die

1578
01:55:18,842 --> 01:55:25,457
Yes Son, your mother is right
We want grandchildren

1579
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:28,669
Don't you have any other topic to discuss?

1580
01:55:29,364 --> 01:55:31,884
This is a very important topic for us
......your marriage

1581
01:55:32,653 --> 01:55:33,653
Now where are you going?

1582
01:55:34,476 --> 01:55:36,104
It's tuesday, I'm going to the temple

1583
01:55:52,573 --> 01:55:56,941
-How are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?

1584
01:55:57,887 --> 01:55:58,937
I am fine

1585
01:56:06,438 --> 01:56:08,002
I heard that you're getting married

1586
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:11,776
I thought my enquiry was over
Shouldn't I marry?

1587
01:56:12,296 --> 01:56:16,620
No, please. Do it
It's your life

1588
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:22,955
The, shawl

1589
01:56:29,363 --> 01:56:31,699
No, I was thinking a few
months back you were saying

1590
01:56:31,971 --> 01:56:34,208
You love me and you want to be my wife

1591
01:56:34,825 --> 01:56:37,176
Yes, I said, but you refused

1592
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:41,092
Yeah, you're a practical girl

1593
01:56:42,172 --> 01:56:44,101
You always do the right
thing, at the right time

1594
01:56:44,103 --> 01:56:46,079
Should I wait for you all my life?

1595
01:56:46,582 --> 01:56:48,280
No, of course not

1596
01:56:49,657 --> 01:56:52,985
But I'm glad that I decided not to marry

1597
01:56:53,865 --> 01:56:55,849
Otherwise, I would get
stuck with a girl like you

1598
01:56:56,066 --> 01:56:57,653
Not a girl like me...

1599
01:56:57,860 --> 01:57:00,291
I'm one unique piece
And now I'm also getting married

1600
01:57:01,671 --> 01:57:03,311
-Is everybody at home fine?
-Yeah

1601
01:57:05,057 --> 01:57:06,271
Sharad

1602
01:57:07,622 --> 01:57:14,301
This is Sharad, my fiancee
This is Satyendr, my old friend

1603
01:57:14,568 --> 01:57:20,248
I know who he is, in fact, she
told me everything about you

1604
01:57:20,856 --> 01:57:22,984
And I want to thank you

1605
01:57:24,629 --> 01:57:25,744
I didn't do anything

1606
01:57:25,753 --> 01:57:27,487
Thankyou, is for doing nothing

1607
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:31,466
What if you married Aarti?
What would I do?

1608
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:33,446
Right...Aarti?

1609
01:57:33,938 --> 01:57:35,371
Just a minute, I'll come now

1610
01:57:40,236 --> 01:57:43,828
Sharad
You bring the car

1611
01:57:46,049 --> 01:57:47,677
If you don't mind, can I say something?

1612
01:57:47,693 --> 01:57:48,845
Say

1613
01:57:49,861 --> 01:57:52,830
Don't marry Aarti, She can't be trusted

1614
01:57:53,956 --> 01:57:55,216
What do you mean?

1615
01:57:55,997 --> 01:57:57,740
See don't mind but she is not stable

1616
01:57:59,093 --> 01:58:03,291
Just a few days ago,
She was following me crazily to get married

1617
01:58:03,619 --> 01:58:04,822
And now see

1618
01:58:06,135 --> 01:58:07,842
See as a friend, I'm telling you

1619
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:10,330
If you marry her, you will be ruined

1620
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:14,421
Otherwise it's your life,
your call....man to man

1621
01:58:16,588 --> 01:58:18,572
Thank you for this advice also

1622
01:58:20,465 --> 01:58:21,669
Here, take the offering

1623
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:24,453
-No, thanks
-Satyendr, you

1624
01:58:35,876 --> 01:58:37,509
How dare you Satyendr Mishra?

1625
01:58:37,524 --> 01:58:38,822
Am I unstable?

1626
01:58:38,859 --> 01:58:41,859
Will Sharad's life be
ruined if he marry me?

1627
01:58:42,383 --> 01:58:43,959
What do you want from me?

1628
01:58:44,448 --> 01:58:47,743
You don't want to marry me
You won't let me marry someone else

1629
01:58:48,191 --> 01:58:49,297
What should I do?

1630
01:58:50,903 --> 01:58:51,931
Do you love me?

1631
01:58:51,939 --> 01:58:54,966
Of course, I love you
How many times should I say, I love you

1632
01:58:56,014 --> 01:58:58,097
So you love me and you
are marrying someone else?

1633
01:58:58,741 --> 01:59:02,540
Ok I won't marry him, will you marry me?

1634
01:59:02,837 --> 01:59:03,885
Will you marry me?

1635
01:59:04,617 --> 01:59:07,601
You won't, because your
ego is not allowing you

1636
01:59:08,334 --> 01:59:10,264
I decided to get married

1637
01:59:10,278 --> 01:59:12,845
Love is not necessary for marriage

1638
01:59:13,907 --> 01:59:16,155
Love can happen after marriage also

1639
01:59:17,019 --> 01:59:18,823
Come, on 10th for the marrige

1640
01:59:18,863 --> 01:59:20,013
I won't come

1641
01:59:20,571 --> 01:59:23,171
Please come, I'll feel good

1642
01:59:54,363 --> 01:59:57,228
Surely come to the wedding

1643
02:00:07,513 --> 02:00:08,539
Sattu

1644
02:00:08,603 --> 02:00:09,623
Hurry up Shanti ji

1645
02:00:10,055 --> 02:00:12,067
Let's go, We have to
take Mahesh also on the way

1646
02:00:12,143 --> 02:00:14,705
Call the driver and
ask where did he reach?

1647
02:00:14,775 --> 02:00:15,900
We are getting late

1648
02:00:16,625 --> 02:00:18,768
What's going on?
Where are you all going?

1649
02:00:18,952 --> 02:00:20,345
We are going to the wedding, dear

1650
02:00:20,353 --> 02:00:21,377
Aarti's wedding?

1651
02:00:21,537 --> 02:00:22,570
Yes

1652
02:00:22,638 --> 02:00:23,889
Why are you going?

1653
02:00:24,257 --> 02:00:27,434
Son, Shukla ji and his wife
personally brought the card

1654
02:00:28,137 --> 02:00:31,213
They pleaded that if we don't go,
They won't give away the bride

1655
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:33,191
We must go, son

1656
02:00:33,575 --> 02:00:34,919
So what,  don't go know

1657
02:00:36,165 --> 02:00:38,612
-Hey, you are looking beautiful
-Thank you

1658
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:42,560
I would say that you also come

1659
02:00:42,609 --> 02:00:45,369
Please, I won't come for sure

1660
02:00:45,464 --> 02:00:47,731
and I don't know why you are going

1661
02:01:02,525 --> 02:01:04,725
-Greetings
-Greetings Aunty and Uncle

1662
02:01:05,229 --> 02:01:06,285
Greetings

1663
02:01:06,526 --> 02:01:09,400
Sattu, Its very good that you have come,
Aarti just asked about you

1664
02:01:10,202 --> 02:01:11,219
It's good that you came

1665
02:01:11,287 --> 02:01:12,775
-Come on, Groom is here
-Come on

1666
02:01:30,511 --> 02:01:31,570
Where did you go Sattu?

1667
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:36,719
Hi, groom
Oh, sorry, Groom is there

1668
02:01:39,867 --> 02:01:40,887
Congratulations Jogi

1669
02:01:40,895 --> 02:01:42,919
You found a nice boy for Aarti
I just talked to him

1670
02:01:43,033 --> 02:01:45,078
Boy is very nice and
The family is also very good

1671
02:01:45,168 --> 02:01:46,381
They didn't have any demands

1672
02:01:46,449 --> 02:01:47,514
O good

1673
02:01:47,583 --> 02:01:49,959
Uncle, Hey Sattu
Come let's meet brother in law

1674
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:51,520
Yeah, introduce him

1675
02:01:51,727 --> 02:01:53,023
Come on..

1676
02:01:53,993 --> 02:01:55,013
Come, Sattu

1677
02:01:55,485 --> 02:01:56,673
Greetings Aunt

1678
02:01:57,091 --> 02:01:58,187
Greetings dear, Be happy

1679
02:02:01,794 --> 02:02:02,858
Brother in law

1680
02:02:02,882 --> 02:02:04,707
Come...This is Aarti's would be Husband

1681
02:02:05,429 --> 02:02:06,567
I know him

1682
02:02:06,949 --> 02:02:09,187
Sorry, you advised me
but I didn't accept it

1683
02:02:09,731 --> 02:02:11,363
I'm Sorry
I should not have done that

1684
02:02:12,139 --> 02:02:15,123
In fact, I felt the smell
of jealousy from your words

1685
02:02:15,434 --> 02:02:18,286
Like if Aarti isn't mine,
She shouldn't be anyone else'....right?

1686
02:02:18,364 --> 02:02:19,907
Listen I'm too embarrassed, really.

1687
02:02:20,133 --> 02:02:21,245
No..no..don't be

1688
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:23,776
Actually, I'm grateful
It's good that you let her go

1689
02:02:24,865 --> 02:02:26,486
Otherwise, today she wouldn't be with me

1690
02:02:26,904 --> 02:02:29,177
And Dad booked the
honeymoon ticket to Masoori

1691
02:02:30,025 --> 02:02:32,041
So now let's go. It's time for the rituals
Let's go

1692
02:02:32,409 --> 02:02:34,961
Yeah, excuse me

1693
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:36,654
Come

1694
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:45,891
Where are you?

1695
02:02:45,897 --> 02:02:47,037
Look at your left

1696
02:02:55,869 --> 02:02:57,941
Can I say something?
You look very pretty in pink

1697
02:02:58,435 --> 02:03:00,495
What do you think..
Why did I wear pink color?

1698
02:03:00,587 --> 02:03:01,723
O, for me?

1699
02:03:03,548 --> 02:03:05,651
I'm in love with you

1700
02:03:07,315 --> 02:03:08,658
Did you like me so much?

1701
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:10,880
Send me your photo in bridal dress

1702
02:03:25,923 --> 02:03:27,282
How do I look?

1703
02:03:27,655 --> 02:03:28,898
Just like my bride

1704
02:03:31,627 --> 02:03:36,755
What have I done, Aarti? I'm really sorry
I love you so much

1705
02:03:38,298 --> 02:03:39,959
I'll not be able to live without you

1706
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:45,309
I ruined everything in my ego

1707
02:03:46,987 --> 02:03:48,099
I love you

1708
02:03:54,147 --> 02:03:55,442
Can I say something?

1709
02:03:57,058 --> 02:03:59,042
Last time you ran away from the marriage

1710
02:04:01,355 --> 02:04:03,149
Today also go away from here, for our love

1711
02:04:04,507 --> 02:04:09,723
How will I go? Mom, Dad,
Sharad and his family

1712
02:04:09,979 --> 02:04:14,049
I'll talk to everyone
I will make them agree

1713
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:16,344
Don't marry
You just come with me

1714
02:04:19,705 --> 02:04:20,741
Let's go

1715
02:04:22,394 --> 02:04:23,394
What happened?

1716
02:04:26,772 --> 02:04:27,917
Choose a finger

1717
02:04:34,406 --> 02:04:37,085
I can't go with you, Satyendr

1718
02:04:38,781 --> 02:04:41,589
I can't break the heart of my family,
or anybody's family again

1719
02:04:42,157 --> 02:04:45,350
No,no..Aarti

1740
02:05:56,571 --> 02:05:57,616

If anyone come forward...

1742
02:05:59,563 --> 02:06:00,708
Listen Satyendr

1743
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:04,379
If Aarti is not mine
I don't want her to be anyone's

1744
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:05,775
I'll shoot

1745
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:10,155
What are you doing?

1746
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:11,987
Don't you see what he is doing?

1747
02:06:12,032 --> 02:06:13,631
Why are you doing so much over acting?

1748
02:06:13,695 --> 02:06:14,872
What is he doing, man?

1749
02:06:15,043 --> 02:06:16,976
He is holding the gun,
this was not in the plan

1750
02:06:17,062 --> 02:06:20,772
Brother in law, I'm not talking to you
I was talking to Sattu brother in law

1751
02:06:21,173 --> 02:06:22,251
What?

1752
02:06:22,315 --> 02:06:23,401
What is this?

1753
02:06:24,624 --> 02:06:30,903
What did you all think?
Only you know planning and drama

1754
02:06:34,529 --> 02:06:36,401

1755
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:40,602
Aarti is gone, you stay here

1756
02:06:42,521 --> 02:06:44,118
It is a gun

1757
02:06:44,682 --> 02:06:46,689
-Will you show me gun?
-Sir

1758

-You take out the gun in every wedding?
-Sir, it's hurting

1760
02:06:57,869 --> 02:07:00,026
Calling me...Brother in law,
You are making fun of me

1761
02:07:00,084 --> 02:07:01,217
I'll say...I'll say

1762
02:07:01,841 --> 02:07:03,871
-What will you say?
-Will you listen......yes what?

1763
02:07:04,137 --> 02:07:06,225
This is your wedding itself

1764
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:10,629
You could have at least told me,
that you planned with Sattu

1765
02:07:10,687 --> 02:07:12,435
Sister, What to do he hit me so much?

1766
02:07:13,456 --> 02:07:15,600
See, my face is red

1767
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:18,107
I'm really sorry

1768
02:07:18,281 --> 02:07:20,174

1769
02:07:20,866 --> 02:07:21,981
And yours too

1770
02:07:22,676 --> 02:07:23,904
