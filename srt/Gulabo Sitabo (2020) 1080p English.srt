We'll see who uses a bulb now!

3
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,250
Welcome one...

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,042
Welcome all...

5
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,458
Here's Sitabo...

6
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,958
And this one's Gulabo...

7
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,708
She comes with a 'Hazratganj' tag.

8
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:16,917
And this one's landed from 'Aminabad,Gadbadjhala'...

9
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,625
And all she wants is to lose herself
in the lanes of 'Chandni Chowk'.

10
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,667
Smart is she.

11
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,250
And clever is she.

-Here you go.
-Hmm.

-Begum!
-Yes?

18

What on earth is going on?

27
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:49,625
I've been around the
whole town looking for you two...

28
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,250
...and here you are,
embarrassing the family name!

29
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,958
C'mmon missies,
out of here for shame sake.

30
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:56,208
And you, Mirza,
only a douche bag like you would...

31
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,208
...make my little girls dance
on the streets. I swear if you ever...

32

There you go again, with your tongue...

33
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,542
...moving faster than
a pickpocket's scissors.

34
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:08,083
Now if I start using mine,
you wouldn't know where to run.

35
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,958
Spare me your nonsense
and give me my share of pennies.

36
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:14,292
- Oh forget it, he's the greediest man alive.
- Hah...! Never.

37
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,292
Yeah am fine being greedy.

38
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,292
Ya what more can an old sourpuss be.

39
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,917
I'll eat milk pudding with
saffron extracts and won't share.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,208
Greedy, yeah.

41
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,292
Go to hell!

42
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,000
Twenty rupees...

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,542
Stop dropping it on my forehead!

44
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:25,000
Well I'm not doing it on purpose...
sit straight then, will you?

45
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,792
Get off from here...

46
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,583
Don't you stain my face!

47
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,875
Now who's lit this
bulb early in the morning?

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,292
Switch it off!

49
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:43,000
Mumbling...

50
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,458
-Tch...what're you doing, Begum?
-I'm just wiping-

51
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,958
{Dulahin} This'll dry up in no time.
It's April for god sake!

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,667
-and when did April come?

53
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:55,625
How the hell does it matter?

{Susheela} Payal,
set up Dadda's (brother's) tiffin.

55

Amongst all these things...that huge bucket...
those leather chappals...goats...

56
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,000
...all that got stolen was my damn bulb?

57
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,375
His bicycle bell is missing too.

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,625
To hell with your bell!

59
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,917
- My bell!
- Oh just ignore this gobshite and get me some tea.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,625
My bulb got stolen and
you're calling me names? Really?

61
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,875
He's crying as if he's lost
all his goddamn family wealth.

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
- He doesn't even have a face of a wealthy man!
- [Tenants laughing]

63
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,042
Remember the day Nehru ji came,

64
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:36,000
those petty thieves were all
over the town plaguing it like rats...

65
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:40,292
...must be one of them who stole his bulb.

66
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,667
Bang on, Begum!

67
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,583
He's a plagued rat of a thief
who's been stealing off us...

68
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,000
...and making a measly penny or two.

69
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,083
Well he better watch out
'cause I won't spare him.

70
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,875
Why are you forever stuck to the TV?

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Go study.

72
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,083
I'm done with my home work...
moreover, it's a holiday.

73
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,833
So? All the more reason to study...uh...

74
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,583
What grade are you in?

75
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,833
Three.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,042
Three? But I've been paying
that damn fee for years!

77
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:25,125
Brother!

78
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,167
What?

79
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,292
I want to take up a job.

80
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,958
Get done with your grade 12 first.

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,375
I'm in the final year of undergrads.

82
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,000
I'd told her to let you know.

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,833
What grade are you in?

84
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,042
Eighth.

85
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,083
C'mmon you guys are not
allowed to grow up that fast!

86
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,542
Your brother is not a rich dude yet.

87
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,583
So there's no point talking to him!

88
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,917
As for me, marriage is not my thing...

89
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,500
I'd much rather earn my own salary
and live respectfully...

90
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,542
...in any case,
I'm living in this home of ours.

91
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,083
Yeah but we don't own it...
it's a rented one.

92
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,875
Rent? We've grabbed it!

93
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,167
What rubbish!

94
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,750
That's what Uncle Mirza
goes around saying it to everyone.

95
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,208
Mirza needs to be dug up
in this mansion.

96
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,917
Are you nuts?!

97
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:37,500
[Morning prayers from a distant mosque
and temple bells...]

98
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:47,667
Your tenant Baankey Rastogi,
he's a daft pillock!

99
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,750
Do you really reckon that he, an owner
of a wheat mill in the main market...

100
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,000
...won't have money to pay a higher rent?

101
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:59,458
Are you asking me this or telling me?

102
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,875
Umm...no I am just saying.

103
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,542
Oh ok, just saying.

104
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,125
That where on earth can one rent
out a house for just 30 rupees?

105
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,583
You won't stop grating on my nerves,
will you?

106
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,750
And only if you were less thick...

107
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,917
...you'd remember
he hasn't paid up for last three months.

108
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,958
Of course I know his story.

109
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,750
His aunt died, father died.

110
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,375
He's still stuck around
like a blood-sucking leech.

111
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,583
The day Begum dies...

112
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:31,542
...I swear to her grave, I am going
to throw out these roaches of tenants...

113
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:36,333
...who are infesting my home
and then that mansion...

114
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,750
It'll be yours...

115
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,167
Yeah...only mine.

116
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:50,583
Say that again...

117
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,208
Mansion will be yours!

118
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,500
Mansion will be mine!

119
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,917
There are five of us
staying in a pigeonhole, Fauzia...

120
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,917
...a small curtained section in the kitchen
is where my mom and sisters bathe...

121
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,042
...and we share the toilet
with Mishraji's family...

122
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,208
...how do I even think of getting married?

123
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,583
When did I even ask for marriage?

124
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,917
But I didn't know you were this poor...

125
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,375
I mean, I thought
staying in FATIMA MAHAL...

126
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,000
...you must be of some rich lineage.

127
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:47,792
For god sake can you
all not be after that mansion?

128
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,292
I'm not after anything, okay?

129
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,875
Pity you're not the landlord but
there's no need to get so cheesed off.

130
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,292
I'm not getting cheesed off!

131
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:58,417
Nor do I fancy being the landlord
of that godforsaken dilapidated mansion...

132
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,917
One kick and there
won't be any of it left.

133
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,208
Fine...kick it and stop blabbering...and
just don't get cheesed off...

...with that chocolate biscuit...

139
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,917
I'm not that poor that I can't buy
a damn chocolate biscuit for you.

It's late...

141
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,833

How about paying up for last two months?

147
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,875
Of course I will.

519
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:56,667
Ya he's the third guy, so?!

520
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,875
What's your problem...?
I didn't enjoy with the others...

521
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:02,250
Am I really the third one?

522
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,875
Looks like your male ego
has been squashed like a lemon.

523
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:07,667
In that case you can leave now...

524
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,167
- Obviously I'm not going to hang around here.
- Yeah get lost.

525
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,583
Strange woman?!

526
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:17,125
Get lost!

527
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:21,875
Keep your hands off me!
What?!

528
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,250
Government official? He came again?!

529
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,917
That archaeology fellow?

530
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,792
I smell trouble.

531
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,417
Look if any government guy comes,
you'll tell me first...is that clear?

532
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,667
You'll get your 50 bucks...

533
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,458
What are you staring at?
Don't you have to get to school?

534
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,292
Yes...

535
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,208
{Payal}Why've you worn my top?

536
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,417
{Neetu}I couldn't find my top.

537
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:57,125
Wait...wait...get off the rickshaw...get off.

538
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:00,375
Don't do that Mirza.

539
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,250
Oh you mind your own business.

540
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,875
They've no penny for rent but
they've all the money for luxuries...huh.

541
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,083
Come.

542
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:39,458
Are you Christopher?

543
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,458
Eh...Pandey Ji...

544
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,917
Christopher Clarke.

545
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:50,917
I specialize in getting house vacated
...and also in getting it nabbed.

546
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,458
I mean how do I trust you...?

547
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,667
Trust?

548
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,917
Look sir, I speak
in English at home.

549
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,083
I eat lunch and dinner for food.

550
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,667
If you have ever heard of that
famous builder in the city, Mun Mun ji.

551
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,917
Well I am very close to him.

552
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,625
And I am not sitting here in this library
to read some useless novel.

553
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm here to make points because
I have to get a house nabbed.

554
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,625
Understood?

555
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,417
Mishra...look after this please.

556
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,708
I'll see you later.

557
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,417
Let's go.

558
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,167
And you don't have
to get the house nabbed.

559
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:27,458
You've to get your house vacated, right?

560
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,625
[Typing and stamping]

561
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,500
It's not some property...
It's my mansion.

562
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:39,375
I know I know it's a mansion.
Here.

563
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,125
- But in legal language it's called property.
- Ok.

564
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,417
And there is not just one
but many property laws.

565
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,083
We will write a plea
and submit it in the court.

566
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,125
We'll give evidence.
Sit please.

567
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:50,333
They'll get the notice
and the house will be vacated.

568
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,250
Is it that simple?

569
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,500
Of course...
I just need property papers.

570
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,625
Huh?

571
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:58,708
Papers?

572
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,167
Yeah. Documentation.

573
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,083
All the records that have been...

574
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,792
...maintained between
the landlord and the tenant.

575
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,042
Those papers...Pandeyji mentioned that...

576
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:11,042
...the property is in the name
of your wife and now she is no more.

577
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,000
No no she hasn't died.

578
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,042
That's what I'm waiting for.

579
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,083
Look the mansion is mine.

580
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,458
It's just that it's not on my name yet.

581
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:21,042
Oh...ok...ok.

582
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,542
There is yet another problem.

583
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:24,000
What?

584
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:29,500
That archaeology fellow has
also started intruding in between.

585
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:32,083
Why would an archaeology guy be interested
in a 3 or 4 bedroom property...?

586
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,292
I don't get it.

587
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,125
I have been telling you
that it is a mansion.

588
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:39,375
- Not some tiny house.
- You mean a real mansion?

589
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:46,125
Yes, which Begum got from
her father and he got from his father.

590
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,333
Oh...now I get it.

591
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,917
What was that 'oh' for?

592
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,167
You see the day Begum dies.

593
00:41:55,375 --> 00:42:01,125
There'll be at least 50 more greedy guys
knocking on your doorstep...overnight.

594
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,333
Are you getting me?

595
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:10,042
That is exactly why
I did not have any child.

596
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,042
So that this mansion remains only mine.

597
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:18,167
For such properties,
even kids get born overnight.

598
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:23,125
Such mansions don't have
single clear ownership ever.

599
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,708
So you need to find out who is dead,
who is alive.

600
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:30,333
Can't sit around any more, 'Sherlock...'

601
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,333
Sherlock?

602
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:33,917
Yes, Sherlock!

603
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,625
Who's dead... who's alive.

604
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,208
Where do I get this?

605
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:48,250
I'll have to ask Begum.

606
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:50,500
Who's dead... who's alive.

607
00:42:57,167 --> 00:43:00,042
This one is my eldest sister.

608
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,625
The one with the dripping nose.

609
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,792
She should be dead by now?

610
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,750
I mean who all are alive...?

611
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,250
I don't really remember...
few of them are alive...few, dead.

612
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,917
This one looks quite old.

613
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,125
By that logic, you too are old
and should be dead by now.

614
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:25,167
Why are you alive?!

615
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,750
So who all are still around?

616
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,000
I told you I don't remember.

617
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,583
Ae Dulhain, where is my betel leaf?

618
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,042
Don't worry, I'll help you.

619
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:40,375
See this is the family photograph taken
during your grandfather's second wedding.

620
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,875
Is it?

621
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,625
Look at this one...
your elder grandma had 11 kids...

622
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,708
...and your younger grandma had 9.

623
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:54,375
Your father was your
younger grandma's 6th born.

624
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:55,958
Is it?

625
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:59,000
- Mirza...? come close.
- Uh...yeah.

626
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,083
Come closer.

627
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:06,042
Did you and I get married
or did I elope with you?

628
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,458
What are you saying, Begum!

629
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:11,708
Of course we got married.

630
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:15,042
I even paid you the traditional dues.

631
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,042
So who did I elope with?

632
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,542
That mongrel, Abdul Rehman.

633
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,125
Anyway.

634
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:28,042
Just tell me who all
are alive in your family.

635
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,875
You seem to be after my family.

636
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:35,083
No...no...all I'm asking is... just the way
your eldest sister is still alive...

637
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,667
...but your middle brother is dead...

638
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:45,333
...so what about your other brothers
and sisters...are they around or...?

639
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:49,208
Look I have not invited
anyone for the party.

640
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,625
Is it clear?

641
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:55,375
When Nehruji comes,
I'm going to complain about you...

642
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,125
...and make sure that
he puts you behind the bars.

643
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:00,042
These are all your family members only.

644
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,958
Your brothers. Your sisters.

645
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:10,458
Just think maybe there was a good news
that someone had passed away.

646
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,250
- I mean...
- What do you mean? Just get lost.

647
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:15,458
Fine...relax.

648
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:19,083
- Hey you...get me something to eat.
- Sure.

649
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:23,000
- Older sister is still alive...
-  Old man is hanging

650
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:26,333
-...younger brother is dead.
-  to threads of a torn long coat

651
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:34,750
He is nearing death but he is not bothered
to change his mischievous ways

652
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:46,744
He is disliked by everyone,
but he is happy doing mischief

653
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:53,583
Huh! You wanted to nab my mansion...
there...now you come.

654
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:57,042
- Oh! this got left out.
-  He wanders aimlessly around

655
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:00,667
- Let me see who enters.
-  every nook and corner

656
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:04,375
Old man is hanging to threads
of a torn long coat

657
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,042
Hey kids...get out...out!

658
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:12,625
He is nearing death but he is not bothered
to change his mischievous ways

659
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:16,750
What?

660
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:19,708
When did he put these locks?

661
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:24,750
There are more?!

662
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,042
What is going on...?

663
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:54,542
Saturn is of low...

664
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:57,750
...but do you see the mount of Venus?

665
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:00,125
- Everything is in these hands.
- Oh?

666
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,333
- Now you see...
- Shukla ji.

667
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:05,125
- Ya?
- It's me.

668
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,792
Sit.

669
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,875
I'll read your right palm
in the canteen...okay?

670
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:13,875
Yes?

671
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,083
You had come to my house...
without informing.

672
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:20,375
- I've no idea what you're talking about
- You'd had climbed the tree...my place.

673
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:22,750
And then you said to stay
in touch...  Fatima Mahal .

674
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:27,583
Right... Now I remember...so...
What brings you here?

675
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:31,042
Bring me the files.

676
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:35,375
Sir... Remember I had mentioned to you about... Fatima Mahal .

677
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,208
- Yeah?
- He's one of the tenants.

678
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:42,083
Rentals have gone miserably up
in Lucknow...better start looking out.

679
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,667
You let him know.

680
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:48,125
What is going on  Shukla ji ...?

681
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:49,375
What are you intending to do?

682
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,875
Why is he asking me
to look for a new house?

683
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,000
And what have you spoken to  Mirza ...?

684
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,125
Let's step out for a bit.

685
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,542
So she is not his mother?

686
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:02,042
No...his wife...17 years older than him.

687
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:04,542
Ohh!

688
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,458
That toilet wall... I hope
you haven't got it repaired, right...?

689
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,208
Why are you after that wall?

690
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:12,042
You have any idea how difficult
it is getting for us to manage.

691
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,333
Shut up!

692
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:15,750
Do not raise your voice,
it is a government office.

693
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,125
Not Nixon market that you
yell and sell bargained clothes.

694
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:25,542
I speak only in favour of your case.

695
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,042
C'mmon.

696
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,667
Hit here...
on the wall.

697
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,333
Why?

698
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:36,292
Pcch... you ask too many questions.

699
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,042
Just do as I say.

700
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:42,958
Harder!

701
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,542
Did it collapse? No.

702
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:52,083
Because this is how
the house walls need to be.

703
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,750
Not like yours that one kick
and the entire building comes down.

704
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:02,542
Maybe we all tenants can
collect some money and repair it.

705
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,042
What about rest of the mansion?

706
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,708
Today it is just one wall...
tomorrow it'll be the roof.

707
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,042
Day after, the stairs.

708
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:11,083
Do you guys have the money?

709
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:19,000
But there are many people living
in such dilapidated buildings...

710
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,792
...your government doesn't go around
taking the responsibility of helping them.

711
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,375
Of course we don't... But we are taking
the responsibility of this mansion.

712
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:28,458
Because if this comes crashing down,
trust me you won't find a single body.

713
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:35,042
Let's go and grab some breakfast.

714
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:36,458
I'm quite full.

715
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,750
I am talking for myself.

716
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,958
Come on.

717
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:43,750
[Distant prayer and birds chirping]

718
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,417
Musa Bagh...

719
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,042
Dilkusha palace...

720
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,458
Farhat Bakhsh palace...

721
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,375
Imam Bara Chota Bara...

722

723
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,000
Asif-ud-daula's Residency...

724
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,125
Qaiser Bagh, Baradari...

725
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:00,042
Now if you notice these are all...

726
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,417
...historically important buildings.
Heritage.

727
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:05,583
Now look here.

728
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,042
Are you saying even trees
come under your authority?

729
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,458
Trees, plants, rivers, canals,
roads, buildings... everything.

730
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:11,958
Do you see this railing?

731
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,208
Are you restoring this building as well?

732
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,583
Oh no...not this useless building.

733
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,208
We were passing by, so just stopped.

734
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:24,750
How do you know all this, Shukla ji?

735
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:30,583
I am the government and
the government knows everything.

736
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:38,125
[Prayer bells ringing]

737
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,042
You know what my father says?

738
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,042
What?

739
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,042
That a man isn't rich
or poor because of his money.

740
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:56,417
But because of his intelligence.

741
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,333
And I'm beginning to feel that...

742
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,125
...you are not only poor
because of your money.

743
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,458
...but even because of a
total lack of intelligence.

744
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,292
As if you are very intelligent!

745
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,083
I'm not but at least I pretend to be.

746
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:07,083
And by pretending over a
period of time I will become.

747
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,958
What have I done now?

748
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:13,208
That man kept rattling off such
big names of the British and Nawabs...

749
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,250
...and you are such a nincompoop
that you stood quiet.

750
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,958
If I was there I would
have pinned him down.

751
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:21,417
And would have told him that I stay inFatima Mahal and not Taj Mahal.

752
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,625
So just stay away.

753
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,833
I was about to talk to mom about us.

754
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,125
I don't think I'm going to do that now.

755
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,042
Just because I called you nincompoop,
you got cheesed off.

756
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:35,042
Fine...they've selected a guy for me.
Should I say yes?

757
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:38,000
Don't bother calling
me for your wedding.

758
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:41,583
I'm not an idiot to waste my
father's hundred bucks per plate on you.

759
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:48,042
Stop clinging to me.
I'll drop you at the bus stop.

760
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,417
I'm not taking the bus nor am
I interested in clinging to you.

761
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,875
You picked me up from home,
so you better drop me back there.

762
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:06,083
[Mumbling]

763
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,458
New ones are for Rs.100 and
second hand ones are for Rs.25/-

764
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:17,917
Okay, give me Rs.20.

765
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:19,125
- Rs.20?
- Rs.20.

766
00:52:19,792 --> 00:52:22,833
Just try and see if it fits.

767
00:52:23,461 --> 00:52:24,983
Oh my god!

768
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,042
Aah! They're fine.

769
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:32,792
I'll keep my old ones.

770
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:34,792
Give me that other one.

771
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,708
Where did you learn all this?

772
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:44,042
I know all the hairstyles. See?

773
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,042
Show.

774
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,042
Ooh nice.

775
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,792
Where will you go looking this stunning?

776
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,458
Why should I tell?

777
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:57,208
But I'm certainly
not taking Mirza with me.

778
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:01,375
Oh that poor man will cry
so much...he'll die without you.

779
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,875
He'll do none of that.

780
00:53:04,042 --> 00:53:06,708
Here...live all the tenants of Mirza.

781
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,708
This whole lane.

782
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:15,000
Begum's section is upstairs
and Mirza's downstairs.

783
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,750
Oh she's sitting downstairs today.

784
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:22,125
Greetings, Begum...how are you?

785
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,042
Greetings.

786
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:25,375
Do you recognise me?

787
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:27,542
Uh...mm...yeah.

788
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,417
If you've recognised me tell me my name.

789
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,542
You're...

790
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,375
Galileo!

791
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,375
Hey Pandey ji,
come over here, will you?

792
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,250
Why have you strung him along with you?

793
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:44,875
What do you mean strung along?

794
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:46,875
Are you calling me a bull
who can be tagged along anywhere?

795
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,000
Forget that, where are the papers?

796
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,167
Who's... what... papers?

797
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,958
Papers for this white elephant.

798
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:52,792
Papers of this property... my dear Uncle.

799
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,375
Ok , so I've figured out
the entire list of all the alive...

800
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:59,000
...and dead relatives, every little detail.

801
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,042
That was point number 2.

802
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,042
Point 1 is papers.

803
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:03,625
Who asked you to jump the order?

804
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,875
Point number 2 and then...
{Baankey} [clears his throat]

It's been days Pandey ji...
You seem to have dropped out of nowhere.

811
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:58,500
Nor me.

812
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,792
But you were there, Mishra ji!

813
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,458
But no one's ever
there during afternoons.

814
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:04,042
Whoever that chap was,
must have been a lawyer.

815
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,542
Must have been?
He was indeed a lawyer...

816
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,208
People are so naÃ¯ve in this house.

817
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:11,667
That chap had a black coat on his arm
and no one noticed... amazing!

818
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,250
Hey don't throw your knowledge
around here... it's ok.

819
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:14,583
I am throwing knowledge?

820
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:17,042

he came, he saw and he went.

the archaeology department fellow.

Hey... I never called anyone.

830

Keep quiet! And don't interrupt now...Guddo... you go on now, we're all ears.

has met Mirza as well.

lawyer on his side too!!

really happening here.

834

Archeology department, the lawyer
and Mirza, they're all on one side...

835

...and we, tenants have no one on our side.

What do you think I've been
trying explain for the longest time ?

837

So, don't try to explain...
get out of here, you!

Very well!

839

Can't we get our own lawyer?

840
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,750
And how do you fathom
that will happen? For free?

841
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,042
"Can't we get a lawyer" hah!

842
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:08,167
Well... we can kiss
this mansion goodbye then.

843

It's not that simple to chuck us out.

Mirza's been at it...scheming
to chuck us out everyday...

845

...and our man is living in
a fool's paradise.

- What do you mean?

00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,833
He has no case.

864
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,458
Needn't worry as long as I am here.
I am no loser.

865
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:16,583
In fact I am the loser here.

866
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:21,000
While I am taking you around Lucknow,
you are meeting Mirza in private.

867
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:23,708
Oh come on... I'd met him once...
to survey the property...

868
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,000
...and you bloody well know about that!

869
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,833
So what was that lawyer
doing at the property then?

870
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,333
Don't boil my blood!

871
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:30,542
Look over there.

872
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Some random saint had a dream about a
1000 tonnes of gold that's buried here...

873
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,750
...that's all it took to start
this manic digging.

874
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:39,000
Gold? So that's the mad rush all about.

875
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,583
Bullshit... There's nothing here.

876
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:41,917
But I got to do my job.

877
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,167
And do you see the media,
like hungry hyenas.

878
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:47,958
Anyway... did you have a word
with the tenants?

879
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:49,083
Just the way I'd told you to.

880
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,750
No.

881
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:52,917
For heaven's sake...
can you do that first...

882
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,833
...and let me handle this lawyer.

883
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,083
1000 tonnes of gold is a lot.

884
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:01,125
And you're getting none of it.

885
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,542
[Church bells ring]

886
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,917
You look pretty...this way.

887
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:13,875
I'll be back in minute.

888
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,625
Where are you off to?

889
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,625
I said I am coming.

890
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,833
These papers are all I have.

891
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:28,417
Alright...that's point no. 1: papers.

892
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:29,083
Hmm.

893
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,667
And now point no 2...

894
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,792
...because your Begum
doesn't have a clear title...

895
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:36,833
...you'll have to procure
NOC from her relatives.

896
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:39,625
Where in the world will I find them...?

897
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:43,958
Well, you'll have to...come what may...
are you getting me?

898
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:46,083
'Cause if this property
is declared 'disputed'...

899
00:58:46,542 --> 00:58:49,125
...then no force on earth can stop that
archeology fellow from entering it...

900
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:51,500
...and that's the end of your dream...

901
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:54,292
...to become the sole owner of that place.

902
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,750
Here...now for god sake
keep these papers safe.

903
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,833
I've let you in today.

904
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,375
If you ever come in after
the gates are locked...

905
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:13,125
...you can jolly well spend the rest
of the night outside the gate.

906
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,417
You know Mirza, you can't even
imagine where I've been today.

907
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:17,708
Really?

908
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,625
Where from?

909
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:26,958
Unnaao... A thousand tonnes
of gold is buried there.

910
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,583
Gold...?

911
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:32,375
Yeah and they are digging it up there.

912
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,833
It's a mad rush, unbelievable.

913
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,208
Hold on...
hold on... where are you off to?

914
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:41,875
Do you remember... 2 years back...

915
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,042
...they found two vaults buried in
an old mansion?

916
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:44,875
Yes...?

917
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,750
This place right here is a mansion too.

918
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:50,333
Old one at that.

919
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:55,833
But you wouldn't ever
dig up your own home... would you?

920
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,542
Obviously... not.

921
00:59:57,917 --> 00:59:59,958
So... that's what got me late.

922
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:23,750
[Metal rod banging on the ground]

923
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,000
Put your ears to the ground.

924
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:38,000
Can you hear it?

925
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,583
[Indistinct mumbling]

926
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:54,875
Here.

927
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:58,000
Can your hear it?

928
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,375
Nothing?

929
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:07,208
What...where?

930
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:16,000
Found anything?

931
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:21,500
Gold...

932
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:31,500
Gold...gold.

933
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,542
Huh...

934
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,333
There's nothing inside...see.

935
01:01:55,417 --> 01:02:00,000
[Baby crying, bells ringing]

936
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,208
Greed... Mirza?

937
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,708
Greed, is like slow poison.

938
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:11,000
It eats up a person from inside.

939
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:16,000
Look at yourself... lying on this cot...

940
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:18,500
...in a year or two you'll find
yourself lying in a coffin...

941
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:20,625
...if you don't stop this nonsense.

942
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,833
The truth is...

943
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:27,542
...firstly I haven't heard
of anyone dying of greed ever.

944
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,083
Got it?
And secondly... I am not greedy.

945
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,542
- You're not greedy?
- Not even an ounce.

946
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:39,583
So this episode of digging up
for gold in the burning heat...

947
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:40,958
...till you passed out, this behavior...

948
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,708
Doesn't it amount to greed?

949
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:48,625
You call that greed. I call it
my love for this mansion... immense love.

950
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,125
Unparalleled love.

951
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,667
And I can do anything for that love.

952
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:58,833
Look, Begum's been keeping unwell,
and you've taken to this bed now...

953
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
...have you ever thought of the future?
What will happen?

954
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:04,042
When?

955
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:07,500
You'll chuck us out, Begum's
not surviving another season...

956
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:11,083
...who's going to look after you
and your dilapidated mansion?

957
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:12,125
Have you ever thought about it?

958
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:13,833
And you're not getting any younger at 78.

959
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:18,792
Look at it this way.

960
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,667
You have no kids.

961
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,792
I have no father to look after.

962
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:27,708
Forget the whole lawyer, court mess...
And adopt me.

963
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:34,792
Get out of here...get out!

964
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:36,333
Get out of here, you termite!

965
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,083
I was giving some sound advice,
but you're not worth it.

966
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,833
But don't you ever try to uproot me.

967
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:42,375
I'm embedded here for good , got it?

968
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:45,042
Adopt me...huh!
Get out, you parasite!

969
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,500
Calls me a parasite, huh!!

970
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:50,958
And that sheet... That's mine...
when did you sneak that in, huh?

971
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:53,208
Your legendary crookery
... it'll never go away.

972
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,417
Sure keep it... take it away.

973
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,833
Just know that I've farted
on it the whole day.

974
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:07,917
Why've you got us here Baankey...
and why are these cannons here?

975
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,333
Because it's time now to attack.

976
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:12,667
What do you mean...?

977
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,583
Do you know who 'Asif-ud-daulla' was?

978
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,000
C'mmon they're from Lucknow...
of course they would've heard his name.

979
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:18,333
Of course.

980
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,542
So Asifudaulla's mom
was quite a dominating lady...

981
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:22,792
...she wouldn't let him be...

982
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:25,375
...where he goes...
who he meets... plays with...

983
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:27,667
...poor guy couldn't do
a thing without her approval...

984
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,917
...then one day,
Asif-ud-daulla just lost it...

985
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:31,708
...he said to hell with her
rules and regulations.

986
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:32,958
I am going to Lucknow.

987
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:37,208
He packed up his bags...
from Faizabad he moved to Lucknow...

988
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,167
...and look what a beautiful city he made.

989
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,042
And why are you telling us all this?

990
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:44,375
'Cause Asif-ud-daulla's mom
and this Mirza in our lives...

991
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:45,833
...they both are just the same.

992
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,542
Don't dry the pickles in the sun...
don't park the car there.

993
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:49,542
Why are the kids playing
in the courtyard...

994
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,875
...mend the wall yourself...
I don't have the money for the painting...

995
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,875
...if you come late
I won't let you in...

996
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,542
...for god sake...
I'm done with his do's and don't's.

997
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,083
Therefore, revolt!

998
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:04,375
If that damn Haveli
doesn't have place for such gentle...

999
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:06,583
...humble, peace loving tenants like us...

1000
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,208
...it certainly can't belong to Mirza.

1001
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,000
When did it ever belong to him?

1002
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,125
But why should we vacate this place?

1003
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:16,333
To enable the restoration work...
how will it happen otherwise?

1004
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,750
Once the restoration is done...

1005
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:23,000
...we'll request the ministry of art and
culture to commission a museum here...

1006
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:24,833
...a place in history.

1007
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:29,625
Sooner or later, we'll be served
a notice to vacate the house...

1008
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:32,000
...it's a matter of
heritage property now.

1009
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,792
But Shukla ji believes...

1010
01:05:33,917 --> 01:05:36,000
...we could definitely get an allotment
for a LIG house as a compensation.

1011
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,667
That's if we go by Shukla ji's advice.

1012
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:40,375
The government is bound
to provide compensation...

1013
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,375
...where will you go otherwise...

1014
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:43,917
...in case it's proven
to be a heritage property.

1015
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,833
But its not proven yet,
so why are we jumping to conclusions?

1016
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,583
That's why I said , "in case" ,
if you didn't hear me correctly...

1017
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:54,208
...but we will prove it ...
a heritage property.

1018
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:56,792
What if we need a MIG accommodation?

1019
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,792
We could try for one or two of them...

1020
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:07,417
...but even the LIG is pretty good too.

1021
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,000
There's a private toilet,
separate kitchen.

1022
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:14,083
Think about it, ok?

1023
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,750
Should we move ahead now?

1024
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,875
Have you ever thought about
this dilapidated mansion?

1025
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,375
What if it collapsed one day?

1026
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,792
Your bodies will have to be hauled
out with the help of cranes...

1027
01:06:21,917 --> 01:06:23,167
...one limb at a time!

1028
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:29,625
[Honking, calling out to customers]

1029
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,667
We need to go to Sitapur.

1030
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:34,708
Take the bus headed from Qaisarbagh.

1031
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:35,708
From Qaisarbagh?

1032
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:36,792
Let's go then... to Qaisarbagh.

You're a wee bit late.

I am here with you in this room.

1087
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I feel I may not be able to do this.

1088

01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:42,958
No.

1090
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,333
I get it.

I mean if your kids
ever come to know that...

...their dad is upto
all this hanky panky stuff.

1093

Won't be the best situation to be, no?

1094
01:09:58,833 --> 01:09:59,833
A kiss?

1095
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:02,000
Maybe just a kiss?

1096
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,042
That will do no harm.

1097
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,667
Uhh... there is an issue there as well.

1098
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,708
Why?

Ok... let's cut the crap...
and get straight to the point.

You just saved yourself
a lifetime of guilt.

use it for the research?

that's when I plucked these.

From the mango tree in our mansion...?

1120

status of the mansion...

Brick?

1126
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,833
It's from your latrine.

1127
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,042
So why is it kept on a plate?

1128
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:55,125
We're researching on it...
its shape...size...width...length...

...the sand it's made up of...

1130

...basically to determine its age.

You haven't studied at all...right?

1132
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:05,917
As if we had the money.

1133
01:12:06,167 --> 01:12:07,667
Your dad died while he was young...?

1134
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:13,542

You are also sad...hmm.

1138
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,417
You need to reach a conclusion soon...
with this brick...

1139

1151
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:11,708
What?

1152
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:16,125

- Fine...but I am...Mirza's lawyer.
- Really?

1155

...And your bullying
won't work with me...

1156
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,042
...'cause grabbing someone's land
or property is not only illegal...

1157
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,083
...but also a punishable crime.

1158
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:37,250
But where have we grabbed it?
We are paying the rent.

Whatever it may be,
but we are still paying it...

the rent for months...

should get that wall mended?

and other maintenance?

1172
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:03,625

researched all this...

...who do you think did that damage...?

1179

So if you know what I mean...

1180
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:22,000
...a case of damage of property
can be filed against you...

1181
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,792
...and in no time you'd be
thrown out of your home.

1182

Thrown out...hah...my foot!

1183
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,833
Well...I'd say go for
out of court settlement.

Hold on...hold on.

our benefits and loss.

Get this, you can't exploit us...

...but if you try to...

1191
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:42,000
...we know how to play
this game of 'sending notices'.

1192
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:43,083
Now leave.

1193

01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:17,917
The landlord is a poor man...
see this architecture...

1204
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:21,375
...English, French...
very meticulous in design...

1205
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,000
...see these arcs.

1206
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:23,917
Shukla ji?

1207
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:29,333
Ok...you just take photos there...
there...click...go go go.

1208
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:30,792
Where did you herd these tourists from?

1209
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,833
Students from abroad.

1210
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:35,792
China, Hong Kong, Cambodia...
research, architecture students.

1211
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:42,208
So you've invaded my house yet again,
without my permission.

1212
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:45,042
It's an official visit.
Need to investigate.

1213
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,000
Investigate?

1214
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,542
Come... come... keep walking.

1215
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:51,708
This old man thinks that government
is interfering his house.

1216
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,083
But he does not know.

1217
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:57,750
Very soon this house will
be declared national property.

1218
01:15:57,958 --> 01:15:59,042
Awwwww.

1219
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:01,417
You go there... click there.

1220
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,250
Do you even know how old this mansion is?

1221
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,083
How many years back... huh?

1222
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,917
Can't say... not very old.

1223
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:12,667
Go on write it down... under the heading heritage,
approximately 100 years old.

1224
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:14,917
It's definitely lesser than that.

1225
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,917
The walls haven't been white washed...
That's why.

1226
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:21,583
Don't act smart with me now...
this is for government records.

1227
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:23,208
When did this railing break away?

1228
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:24,833
Maybe a year or two back.

1229
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,125
He is lying.

1230
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,542
Outright... it's been in that
broken state since I was born.

1231
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:29,542
I am lying?

1232
01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:33,833
Write it down... 50 years back.

1233
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,500
Come... come.

1234
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:42,875
And this whole area
belongs to Begum.

1235
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,792
All of this...
include it in the antique items list.

1236
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:45,708
Click photos of each
one of them... come on.

1237
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,083
There's more trash
stored inside as well.

1238
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:48,083
Really?

1239
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:51,375
Trash... what trash... huh?
Listen now.

1240
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,792
Enough of this nonsense...
out from here now... out!

1241
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:56,833
Yes yes we are leaving.

1242
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,708
Yes, leave now!

1243
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:00,042
I am warning you!

1244
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:00,833
Mirza!

1245
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:01,917
Get out! Leave now.

1246
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,708
I am warning you...
don't you touch me... Mirza.

1247
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:04,708
Hah! Don't touch me, he says.

1248
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,875
I will get an official
letter the next time.

1249
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,125
What letter are you talking about?

1250
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:10,000
And how and with who's permission
are you selling this mansion?

1251
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,667
- What do you mean?
- Selling it off... really?

1252
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:12,958
Up until yesterday,
you were conniving with...

1253
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:14,208
...the lawyer and filing
a case against us tenants...

1254
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,875
-...now you're selling it off?!
- Oh hold on... he can't sell.

1255
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,333
It's my mansion my land, my will...

1256
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:20,958
...I'll sell it as I wish, whosoever to...

1257
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:22,958
You can, but not without our permission.

1258
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:24,875
Permission... what permission,
what's this permission nonsense.

1259
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,542
Permission... which I will never grant.

1260
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:29,000
What do you mean?

1261
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Let the fun begin!

1262
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:38,833
Permission.

1263
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:40,708
Won't give permission! Huh!

1264
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,625
Mansion...

1265
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:42,917
That's one good thing you did...

1266
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,958
...letting Gyanesh know that
you're selling the property.

1267
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:45,625
Sit.

1268
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:49,792
I just said what I had to at that point...

1269
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:53,500
...but in reality...
I don't want to sell the mansion.

1270
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:57,083
Firstly, we need a power of attorney
in your name.

1271
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:01,583
For that we'll need Begum's
signature or a thumb impression.

1272
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:05,833
I don't think she will be able
to recollect her signature...

1273
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:08,958
...thumb impression.

1274
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,833
That I'll ensure... but after that,
the mansion will be in my name, right?

1275
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,625
Of course...mansion will be yours,
but only after Begum's death.

1276
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:20,792
Here...get her signature here at the bottom.

1277
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:22,625
...or else her thumb
impression for sure.

1278
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,000
Ok.

1279
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,417
- Mirza, tea?
- No, you carry on.

1280
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:41,199
[Snoring]

1281
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:32,167
[Snoring]

1282
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,292
Look at this mess?

1283
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:50,250
It's on all my fingers.

1284
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,667
But not this hand?

1285
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:55,917
Don't worry...
we'll wash it... do you want some tea?

1286
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:03,792
[Crowd - indistinct chattering]

1287
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:13,292
- What's this?
- Huh?

1288
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:16,792
The thumb print you asked for...
what else?

1289
01:20:18,167 --> 01:20:19,208
It's all wrong.

1290
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,417
I asked you to get a
left hand thumb impression...

1291
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:23,917
...you've got the right hand one!

1292
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:27,042
What's wrong now?

1293
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,208
Am ok...

1294
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,458
Am ok.

1295
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:32,417
If the power of attorney
papers aren't done...

1296
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,875
...you can forget about
your beloved mansion.

1297
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:47,708
[Afternoon prayers]

1298
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:49,917
Here comes Mirza.

1299
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:59,000
How are you, Begum?

1300
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:28,000
It's ok.

1301
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:45,875
Like I was saying...

1302
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:50,750
...let bygones be bygones...

1303
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:58,083
...we'll leave things the way
they were... like always...

1304
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:01,875
Baankey can stay...

1305
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:06,333
...I can talk to Christopher...
he will withdraw the case and sir...

1306
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:13,083
...all the investigations
that you're conducting...

1307
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,042
...all that can also stop... what say...?

1308
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:21,042
Look Mirza,
this ship has now sailed too far...

1309
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,875
...the mansion has been
documented in our records...

1310
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,375
...and there is no turning back.

1311
01:22:26,792 --> 01:22:28,000
Oh... but.

1312
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:31,500
- Let me show you something.
- Huh?

1313
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,250
You should see how
our department works...

1314
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:34,667
...you will feel proud too.

1315
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:38,167
This is our lab.

1316
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:41,042
Everything is done
very meticulously here...

1317
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:44,375
...with minute detailing...
all these are antiques.

1318
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:51,458
Do you have an idea how much
it costs in London... America?

1319
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:54,500
Yes... all that is fine
but what about my mansion?

1320
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:56,167
Again that mansion!
That's all you can think of.

1321
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,500
Do you know how
much that mansion costs?

1322
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:00,542
You'll lose your sense... if I tell you.

1323
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,000
No...I mean... I don't know... how much?
How much do you think it's worth?

1324
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:07,250
Its worth... it's priceless!

1325
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:12,375
But... Its monetary value?

1326
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,042
Priceless.

1327
01:23:16,417 --> 01:23:17,458
Uh...oh...?

1328
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:19,875
Come.

1329
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:25,042
Some things in life are so invaluable that
you cannot put a number to their worth...

1330
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,667
...for eg. a mother's love...

1331
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:31,083
Begum's love... in your case...

1332
01:23:31,917 --> 01:23:37,125
How invaluable it is...
but can you put a number to it?!

1333
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:42,750
Similarly, your mansion...
priceless.

1334
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:48,042
Oh no no no... hold on, hold on.

1335
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:53,958
I am ok... uh...don't worry...am ok.

1336
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:56,917
- What did you say...priceless?
- Yes... absolutely priceless.

1337
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:59,458
{Guddo} So what's his problem if I went
and met that lawyer, Christopher?

1338
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,250
Why is he creating such a ruckus...
and it's not that I went alone.

1339
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:04,292
Alone? Didn't you go alone
to meet Gyanesh?!

1340
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:07,458
Since the day she's
stopped oiling her hair...

1341
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,083
...it's evident what all is
she up to...it's all clear.

1342
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:12,042
- Baankey... I'm coming over.
- Hmm

1343
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:14,167
Not that anyone's complaining about you...

1344
01:24:14,292 --> 01:24:15,750
...but you've been acting
footloose nowadays.

1345
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:16,750
I don't care.

1346
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:18,708
...I'd gone to get a job done...
that's all...

1347
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,292
Exactly my point...
why are you meddling in between?

1348
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:22,917
Why are you interfering?

1349
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:25,125
'Cause I don't think you're capable
of doing this by yourself.

1350
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,375
All you're doing is being Gyanesh's lapdog...

1351
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,417
...he promised an LIG flat
and you fell for it...

1352
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:32,125
...while I'm talking about a proper flat...
if not here... then a backup.

1353
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:34,417
Well... Guddo's making sense.

1354
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:36,625
Ok then! Listen to her.

1355
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:39,292
I am out of this, mom...
Don't come to me for anything.

1356
01:24:39,417 --> 01:24:42,042
Just look at him, mom...
look at him...he's just jealous.

1357
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:44,542
Truth is he can't handle
the fact that I have gone and...

1358
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:46,167
...done something productive on my own.

1359
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:49,500
Brother... you go ahead and do your
own thing... I'll manage everything...

1360
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,417
...mom, the house
and these two as well...

1361
01:24:51,542 --> 01:24:53,125
...you can just go
and romance that Fauzia.

1362
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,083
Who's this Fauzia now?

1363
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:58,042
No one... just don't bother.

1364
01:24:58,167 --> 01:24:59,375
Are you getting married to her?

1365
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:03,417
Brother, you can romanceFauzia on the terrace.

1366
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:07,083
Just like Guddo... she romances
many boys behind the water tank.

1367
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:11,208
Guddo?

1368
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:22,208
What happened? Begum? She's not well?

1369
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:37,042
Uh... well... You look somewhat sad?

1370
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,417
Can't say anything at this moment.

1371
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:42,333
She's not going to make it, is it?

1372
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:45,875
Or...?

1373
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,042
Can't say anything at this moment.

1374
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:52,208
The disease is such that...
everything is...

1375
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:54,042
So it's time for...?

1376
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,167
Can't say anything at this moment.

1377
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:02,208
- You should be prepared...
- No... no I get it... I understand.

1378
01:26:02,417 --> 01:26:04,167
- My fees?
- Fees?

1379
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:09,958
That's all I have on me...
you may leave.

1380
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:15,750
Hey... who got him here?

1381
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,792
- No... no you go inside.
- Why did you get him here?

1382
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,875
- Go inside... to Begum.
- How did you just walk in like that?

1383
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,375
Why don't you go inside to the Begum...

1384
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,208
Oh... I see.

1385
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:29,083
You can't see her
in so much pain... hmm.

1386
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:32,875
- Get him out of here.
- I swear you're worse than a devil.

1387
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:38,875
Don't call me that... I'm no devil...
I'm telling you again, ok?

1388
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:42,708
Get out of my way.

1389
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:09,292
So Mirza... tell me.

1390
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:11,083
I need a shroud.

1391
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,417
- Shroud?
- Yesss...

1392
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:15,375
- Is it the Begum?
- Why don't you show me one huh?

1393
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,167
When did she pass away?

1394
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:23,083
- How much is it for?
- Rs.150...

1395
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:26,000
Can you show me something cheaper?

1396
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:30,375
Mirza... have a little shame... huh?
You can't be negotiating at this hour?

1397
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,875
Here... take it, that's all I have.

1398
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:39,667
Why are you packing so many flowers?

1399
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:42,042
I'm not decorating my house...
here keep them back.

1400

[Afternoon prayers]

1401
01:27:50,792 --> 01:27:53,125
That far...huh?

1402
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:58,208
Begum's mother, her dad...
they're all buried in the mansion.

1403
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:00,167
And you want to burry Begum here?

1404
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:06,875
The farther she is from the mansion...
the better...

1405
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:11,000
...she'll fit in this little space.

1406
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:16,083
Even after she's dead...
if she remains stuck in the mansion...

1407
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:17,708
...what's the point then?

1408
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:19,333
But you'll have to pay.

1409
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:24,750
Hmm... you get the ground ready...
I'm getting her here.

1410
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:28,000
I'll pay you then... now move.

1411
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:40,295
{Lady tenant} You're looking beautifulBegum... come ... quick.

1412
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:43,000
{Begum} Thanks,
I'm seeing you after many days myself.

1413
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:45,366
{Dulhain} Come this way, Begum.

1414
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:48,458
Oh! This vulture is back?

1415

{Tenants laughing}

1416
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:55,000
Where to?

1417
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:58,125
She's been really beat because of her illness...
I'll take her out for a walk.

1418
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,083
We'll also look up the doctor
on our way back... l

1419
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:03,458
Let me look for tempo.

1420
01:29:03,792 --> 01:29:06,042
- Go quickly... and look for one.
- Yes yes.

[Tempo engine]

1427
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:27,000
Our Begum... she really cares for you.

1428
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:29,542
She's got your favourite
cotton candy... try some.

1429
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:37,208
Have it... and go to sleep now.

1430
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,625
- {Christopher} So here is the blueprint.
- {Guddo} Blueprint.

1431
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:21,458
It's a fifteen floor building...
12 floors here and 3 on this side.

1432
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:22,792
They'll all be next to each other?

1433
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,792
Yes next to each other
but 12 floors tall!!

1434
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,542
Mirza's here!!! What should I do?

1435
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:28,042
- Sit, keep seated.
- Should I leave?

1436
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:31,042
You've been appointed, my dear.

1437
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:34,458
Come Mirza... come join us.

1438
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:36,167
Her? She's Guddo.

1439
01:31:36,292 --> 01:31:37,708
Why have you called her?

1440
01:31:38,042 --> 01:31:40,500
She is an expert in legal language.

1441
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:43,458
I've kept her as my assistant.
Come and sit.

1442
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:45,042
Look at this... is it alright?

1443
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,750
Very good.

1444
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:49,000
Correct. Sit.

1445
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:50,792
She's very helpful.

1446
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:57,375
We've solved the case.

1447
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,125
Look Guddo, the real villain
in your life is not Mirza...

1448
01:32:03,542 --> 01:32:07,167
...and Mirza,
your tenants aren't the villains either.

1449
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:12,375
It's that conniving, meddling...Gyanesh from archaeology

1450
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,750
And what's the logic here?

1451
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:15,125
What do you mean?

1452
01:32:17,167 --> 01:32:19,708
If this case reaches the civil court...

1453
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:21,625
...it will take at least
6 to 8 months to resolve.

1454
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:25,167
So the longer it drags...
The longer we can stay, isn't it?

1455
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:27,542
Common Guddo, you should know better.

1456
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:31,000
Gyanesh has his personal
interest in the mansion...

1457
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:33,958
...that's why he is chasing this issue...

1458
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:36,167
...the day he gets his hands
on some solid evidence...

1459
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:38,375
...2 months is all it will
take... and you will be thrown out...

1460
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:40,125
- 2 months... that's all?
- 2.

1461
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:42,375
Ohh!

1462
01:32:42,917 --> 01:32:44,167
So Mirza...
I have a suggestion...

1463
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:48,208
...before Gyanesh makes his move...

1464
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:51,250
...there's only one option left...

1465
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:53,917
...just sell the mansion.

1466
01:32:57,667 --> 01:33:00,250
- Hmm... I get it now.
- What?

1467
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:04,250
If we sell the mansion,
we'll get something in hand...

1468
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,167
...and if the government
takes over... we'll get zilch.

1469
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:07,542
Correct!

1470
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:08,708
You got it!

1471
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,125
You know that builder... Mun Mun ji.

1472
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,167
He's shown a lot of interest...
in the mansion... I know him personally.

1473
01:33:14,542 --> 01:33:16,125
We'll sort everything in a week or two.

1474
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,917
I've spoken to him personally...
he's a very famous builder.

1475
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:22,542
Gyanesh... that crook won't
last in front of him... am telling you.

1476
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:23,792
Have you understood?

1477
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:27,875
Have you got the papers now...
or you just sauntered in aimlessly?

1478
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:32,042
What about the money...
when can we get that?

1479
01:33:32,167 --> 01:33:34,042
Can you get the papers in place first?

1480
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:36,333
This isn't a flea market...
we're not selling trinkets here.

1481
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:38,125
- Guddo?
- One second.

1482
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:40,250
Really Mirza...
your status is no less than a beggar.

1483
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:41,708
No illegal talking please.

1484
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:44,875
We're talking about millions here.

1485
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,167
We must have a proper deal in place...
I am very clear about it.

1486
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:51,125
Ok...ok...ok.

1487
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,792
Thank you.

1488
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:56,625
Guddo, file these duplicates please.

1489
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:00,458
(Mumbling)

1490
01:34:02,917 --> 01:34:06,167
Hello hello... yes... Sinha you bugger,
why is it taking so much time?

1491
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:09,417
Uncle... few formalities are left.

1492
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:12,708
You can consider it done...Gyanesh... tell him.

1493
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:16,333
Uncle it's like this... the bricks of
the mansion aren't exactly...

1494
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:18,042
... the pristine antique ones like in
the historical Imambara...

1495
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:25,042
...but I can tell you that it's the
typical British / French structure ones...

1496
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:28,542
...matches perfectly with it...about 20%.

1497
01:34:28,917 --> 01:34:31,542
So it's done then...
go get the report ready.

1498
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:33,333
Just one more thing, Uncle.

1499
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:37,292
There's an old mango tree there...
we're in talks with the forest dept...

1500
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:39,667
...we're figuring out its age...
the variety of the plant?

1501
01:34:39,792 --> 01:34:44,375
Even the mango tree is witness to the
historical importance of the mansion...

1502
01:34:45,042 --> 01:34:46,542
...then why are we dithering so much, Sinha?

1503
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:48,083
Look, I am not in power right now...

1504
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,042
...so no media's going to
really pay attention to me...

1505
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,458
...let's wrap this up quickly...

1506
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,750
- What date is it today?
- 29th.

1507
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:58,625
Great... so let's get this sorted by
15th august... get the property sealed...

1508
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:00,792
...and it should be livable
in about a year.

1509
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:03,125
Uncle... you plan to...
stay in the mansion?

1510
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:07,292
Who's this chap?
And why is he calling me uncle?

1511
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:09,875
That mansion has a lot of tenants..
uncle...he's one of them.

1512
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:11,167
Alright...ok.

1513
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,083
Give him some space
in the servant quarters...

1514
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,708
...that are being constructed
behind the mansion.

1515
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,042
- Alright.
- Ok.

1516
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:17,000
See you.

1517
01:35:20,542 --> 01:35:21,750
(Mumbling)

1518
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:25,042
Get the bricks tested
in the lab... real quick.

1519
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:27,083
Alright... got it.

1520
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:29,250
I'm not going to stay
in the servant quarters.

1521
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,250
Listen you... just accept
what you're being offered...

1522
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:33,625
...else you'll end up
with nothing at all.

1523
01:35:33,917 --> 01:35:36,083
{Gyaanesh}These are called the LIG flats!

1524
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:53,042
- {Receptionist} Sir is busy.
- You can go in now.

1525
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:54,042
Ok.

1526
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:04,667
- North facing and south...they're both equally.
- [Knock on the door]

1527
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:08,875
This better not be a bogus case
like the last time?

1528
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:12,042
Not at all...this time we've got
all the papers in place...

1529
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:13,792
...there's a duplicate copy...
right outside.

1530

Do you need any help... kidnapping?

1531
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:16,458
No... no no.

1532
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:18,667
- Need goons?
- Not required...

1533
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:23,167
You know the Begum...
she won't be around for too long.

1534
01:36:23,667 --> 01:36:26,875
And then Mirza...he's a dimwit...
the one sitting outside.

1535
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:28,500
Mirza's sitting outside?

1536
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:31,250
What's with you?
Get up and sit properly.

1537
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:34,458
When is the deal happening...?

1538
01:36:35,375 --> 01:36:36,500
Max... Two to three days.

1539
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:37,792
Let's do it in two days.

1540
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,625
2 days... sounds doable.

1541
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:42,750
What about my commission?

1542
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,000
Just shut up... commission, my foot.

1543
01:36:53,792 --> 01:36:56,167
Mun Mun ji...
he maybe a big shot builder.

1544
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,917
But am no less... I told him very clearly...Mirza is my closest buddy.

1545
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,167
I won't take him for a ride.

1546
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,542
He asked me what should we do?

1547
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:05,042
I told him to organise
the advance quickly.

1548
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:06,708
Now?, he asked.

1549
01:37:07,292 --> 01:37:08,417
{Chuckles} He really respects me.

1550
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:10,042
I said take your time.

1551
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:13,292
The moment Mirza hands over the
original papers...you pay the advance.

1552
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:17,500
Now, you get the original papers,
as soon as you can.

1553
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,208
I'll organise the bulldozer.

1554
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:22,125
Like Now? Where will we go?

1555
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:26,750
Not like right now Ms. Guddo...
Let's first get the advance.

1556
01:37:27,667 --> 01:37:30,250
- How much money will I get?
- 5% share.

1557
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:31,917
How much would that be?

1558
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:33,500
Rs,500,000/-

1559
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:35,875
Get the papers ready...

1560
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:38,667
I'll begin at my end too.

1561
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:41,083
Come on, Guddo.

1562
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:44,750
Mirza... you're forgetting your file.

1563
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:52,542
One...ten...hundred...thousand...
one hundred thousand.

1564
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:57,375
Five hundred thousand!!!

1565
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:00,750
That's five hundred thousand?!

1566
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,208
Mirza... are you alright?

1567
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:05,083
Huh?...one...

1568
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,708
Should we drop you home?

1569
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:08,125
Ten... Hundred...

1570
01:38:10,042 --> 01:38:12,917
Five hundred thousand!

1571
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:18,167
You come from dust,
and to dust you shall return.

1572
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:21,583
You come from dust,
and to dust you shall return.

1573
01:38:21,708 --> 01:38:25,542
Five hundred thousand!

1574
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:34,125
You come from dust,
and to dust you shall return.

1575
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,125
All I am saying is that be it LIG...
or an apartment...

1576
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:46,042
...we'll stay together only wherever we go.

1577
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:48,292
Have you ever wondered

1578
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:50,542
about this fragile body?

1579
01:38:51,042 --> 01:38:53,167
The Gurus shed light,

1580
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:55,542
but you could never comprehend.

1581
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:57,542
Start stop, start stop,

1582
01:38:58,042 --> 01:39:00,042
the rhythms of breath

1583
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:04,375
And when it does stop, what would
you have lost, what would you have gained?

1584
01:39:05,667 --> 01:39:10,167
You come from dust,
and to dust you shall return.

1585
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:15,125
You come from dust,
and to dust you shall return.

1586
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:17,958
Dear friend...

1587
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:22,917
You come from dust,
and to dust you shall return

1588
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:24,708
{Tenants} Let Baankey talk.

1589
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:27,042
That's the first property deed...

1590
01:39:27,167 --> 01:39:30,500
...and this is the second one,
after increased rent...

1591
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:32,292
-...these are the receipts.
- Okay.

1592
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:34,292
Let's show all these papers to Baankey.

1593
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:36,208
- Everyone's ready?
- Yes.

1594
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,667
- And papers are in place?
- By when will they be here?

1595
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:39,792
They'll be here... ok?

1596
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:41,292
[Car engines revving]

1597
01:39:41,417 --> 01:39:42,375
Ya... right here.

1598
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:47,750
- This way sir.
- Sir, may I put up the board?

1599
01:39:47,917 --> 01:39:50,000
Once I'm done with
reading the notice, then.

1600
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:52,292
I really look forward to this part
of my job...

1601
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,375
-One of you cops come with me.
-Ok sir.

1602
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,750
This way sir...

1603
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:58,417
Those guys are here, Baankey.

1604
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,167
This way sir.

1605
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,208
Mom...they are here...

1606
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,833
[Indistinct murmuring]

1607
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:10,542
- Do you see this place, sir?
- Hello.

1608
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,792
I'm presuming everyone is here...come...

1609
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:15,208
Yeah we're all here...
and ready...

1610
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:16,875
Come, let's go.

1611
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:21,042
MIRZA CHUNNAN NAWAB, are you...?

1612
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,875
As if you didn't know my name.

1613
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,042
Give me the notice.

1614
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,667
Pay attention here.

1615
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:32,083
This is an official notice.

1616
01:40:33,667 --> 01:40:38,292
After using and completing various
scientific methods of investigations...

1617
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:40,250
...we, the archaeology department,
have come to a conclusion...

1618
01:40:40,458 --> 01:40:42,500
...that this 100 year
old mansion is not only...

1619
01:40:42,625 --> 01:40:44,500
...dangerous for the habitants of this place...

1620
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:51,375
...but is of an extreme
historical importance as well.

1621
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:54,958
Therefore keeping in mind its possible
social and cultural contribution...

1622
01:40:55,083 --> 01:41:03,042
...we hereby declare that all the tenants
vacate this mansion at the earliest.

1623
01:41:03,292 --> 01:41:04,792
- By order.
- What is he saying, Baankey?

1624
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:06,917
We have to leave? Where will we go?

1625
01:41:07,042 --> 01:41:09,500
[Crying]

1626
01:41:09,625 --> 01:41:11,292
[Chaotic screaming]
What about our rights?

1627
01:41:11,417 --> 01:41:16,000
Wait I am asking...wait...
can you guys...shut up...I am talking!

1628
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:18,625
Mr.Shukla, I went around
the whole town with you, for this?

1629
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:19,500
Is this how you pay us back?

1630
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:21,917
What about the LIG-MIG
apartments you had promised us?

1631
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:23,458
Or was it part of your deceit plan?

1632
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:26,042
Hand over the official notice to him
and put up the board outside.

1633
01:41:26,125 --> 01:41:27,208
I've no interest in this drama.

1634
01:41:27,333 --> 01:41:28,083
Drama?

1635
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,542
Is this drama?

1636
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:34,708
What the hell are you saying?
{Tenants}[Indistinct screaming]

1637
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:37,250
{Baankey} Shut up all of you.

1638
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,250
You committed for LIG
MIG accommodation for us.

1639
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:41,333
Why is it missing in the notice?

1640
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:43,458
Why isn't it mentioned here?
We want it in writing.

1641
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:45,875
Where do you reckon we'll go from here?
And what about this Mirza?

1642
01:41:46,042 --> 01:41:48,167
Why would he go anywhere...
he's the owner...

1643
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:52,292
I get it...he's the owner so he stays...
And we're thrown out...

1644
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:57,250
...and we...we are the doofus dogs
who fell for the bone you showed us...

1645
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:59,625
...if I could throttle you just now.

1646
01:41:59,792 --> 01:42:02,375
You can't deny us those LIGs.

1647
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:03,625
Put that stick away.

1648
01:42:03,917 --> 01:42:06,792
LIG comes under another department...
not mine...

1649
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:08,417
But you never mentioned that earlier.

1650
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:10,208
It's not as if we're
asking you to vacate now.

1651
01:42:10,417 --> 01:42:11,583
2 months notice is a good period.

1652
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:15,333
Not good enough to find
a new accommodation!

1653
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:19,792
No no...these pests can not
infest my mansion anymore...

1654
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:22,667
And you guys leave too.

1655
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:25,458
I've already sold off this mansion toMun Mun ji builders...so go...

1656
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:27,958
And Christopher made it
all happen...now do you get it...?

1657
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:29,042
We'll get a flat.

1658
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:31,750
How can you sell it...?
It's utter rubbish...

1659
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:34,292
Say what you may...
this place is sold!...

this property, we are entitled...

- Very nice.

- You've really done superb this time around.
- Thank you.

1668
01:42:59,042 --> 01:43:02,208
- We can build up to 25 floors at least.
- Hold on...hold on.

1669
01:43:03,042 --> 01:43:04,667
You can't construct any building here.

1670
01:43:05,042 --> 01:43:06,417
This mansion is getting sealed.

1671
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:08,750
- They are from archaeology department.
- Yeah that's ok you can seal it for now...

1672

...once our cranes and bulldozer arrive,
we'll remove that seal.

here, neither now nor in the future...

...we will be locking the gates.

1676

Yes that's a good idea.

take the keys from them.

- Just buy them out...
