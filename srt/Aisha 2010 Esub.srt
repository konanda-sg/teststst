1
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,040
Lots of chatting.

2
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:18,915
Such are our days and nights.

3
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:23,874
There something
going on every moment.

4
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:30,207
People call us mad.

5
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,582
Are you ready now?

6
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,499
Here we go.

7
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,957
By the way. All the way.

8
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,082
The life that we have got.

9
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,665
It sings. It laughs.

10
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,749
Its a bit crazy.

11
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,332
We fight. We kiss and make up.

12
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,290
Its new every moment.

13
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,957
Its moody. Its stubborn.

14
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,124
I have no idea what to do about it.

15
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,999
You cant stop us.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,749
We fly like the breeze.

17
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:31,582
That's our life.

18
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,207
That's our style. What to do?

19
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,165
If someone minds, what to do?

20
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,957
Everyone's upset with us now.

21
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,207
Just forget it.

22
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,374
Exchange the rings.

23
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,207
'So romantic.'

24
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,790
'Isn't my aunt looking hot? '

25
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,707
'Actually, she always was.'

26
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,082
'She was Miss. India in 1 982.'

27
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,457
'And the best is, she
never let us miss mom.'

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,999
'Look at my colonel uncle.'

29
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,915
'He's so handsome, isn't it? '

30
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,207
'But Those moustaches.'

31
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,249
'He looks like the
villains from the 1970s.'

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,665
'You know, I introduced uncle
and aunt for the first time.. '

33
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,415
'.. at the Gymkhana club.'

34
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,499
'I made them sit at
the same bridge table.. '

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,582
'.. and uncle lost the
game but won aunt's heart.'

36
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,374
'Aaliya, my elder sister.'

37
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,915
'She had the same
boyfriend from school to college.'

38
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,582
'And she also married him.'

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,165
'So boring.'

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,374
'You know what? These days,
she only thinks about food.'

41
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,332
'Because she's six
months' pregnant.'

42
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,832
'All thanks to her one
and only boyfriend.. '

43
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,249
'.. and now my brother-in-law,
Karan Burman from Mumbai.'

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,082
'How will Aaliya ever
fit into her jeans again? '

45
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,582
Congratulations, Colonel.

46
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,332
'And that's my papa.'

47
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,790
'He's so cute, isn't he? '

48
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,540
'His small happiness
turns into a big party.'

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,165
'Add a few tears,
drama and butter.. '

50
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,499
'.. and anyone can be papa's guest.'

51
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,499
'Everyone's so happy.'

52
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,999
'It looks so nice, doesn't it?'

53
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,290
'I planned all this.'

54
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,082
'You know what? '

55
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,332
'When everything goes as planned,
it feels so nice.'

56
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,999
The story of the heart..

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,624
..I want to tell openly now.

58
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,040
You cant forget if you hear it once.

59
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,332
Hear it once.

60
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,165
'Pinky, my best friend.'

61
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,332
'We've been together
since kindergarten.'

62
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,499
'I would eat her lunch
and she would eat mine.'

63
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,624
'I would do her homework
and she would do mine.'

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,665
'Pinky does like boys.
But love? No chance.'

65
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,374
'Whatever. We're friends forever.'

66
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,957
"By the way. All the way."

67
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,915
When the friendship
is from the heart..

68
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,290
..both my heart and I..

69
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,999
..took this vow.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,124
Whatever happens now
we wont be afraid ever.

71
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,832
I've decided. I want
to be a weather girl.

72
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,999
Read out the weather report..

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,957
..and collect a fat cheque.

74
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,957
It's so cool.
- It is.

75
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,665
Okay, aren't there
any cute guys here?

76
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,040
No way.

77
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,332
'Randhir Gambhir.
He's such a loser.'

78
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,790
'Total Yuppie.'

79
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,707
'He's always following me around.'

80
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,332
'His family owns
Ever Supreme Sweets.'

81
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,624
'The confectionary kings of India.'

82
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,790
'And he's their darling prince.'

83
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,332
'These days organising weddings.. '
- '.. has become a real pain.'

84
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,832
'Lt's seasonal, after all.'

85
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,374
'The real satisfaction comes
when two people come together.'

86
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,540
'I mean perfectly
matching two perfect people.'

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,499
I'd like to propose a toast.

88
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,374
Here's to aunt and my new uncle.

89
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,665
May you have all the
happiness in the world.

90
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,790
That's beautiful.

91
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,749
I'd like to propose a toast.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

92
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,457
'Who is she? '

93
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,874
'Right -That's Shefali.'

94
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,874
'Aunt told me that her aunt
and uncle brought her here.. '

95
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,374
'.. to get her married.'

96
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,957
'Did you see what I just saw? '

97
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,082
'They look perfect together.
Perfect.'

98
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,332
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make a toast.

99
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,915
Shut up, Randhir. Do
you know what a toast is?

100
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,749
I know it, Pinky.

101
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,749
So sweet..

102
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:29,582
Ladies and gentlemen. To Aisha.

103
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:37,332
Actually, Aisha's the one
who has done everything.

104
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:43,457
There was something
between aunt and sir..

105
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,415
I mean there was..

106
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,582
They had something going on.

107
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,957
But Aisha brought them together.

108
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,790
I mean, if it wasn't for Aisha..

109
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,540
..then aunt would've never met sir.

110
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,374
Aisha, you're a great girl.

111
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,165
Your heart..

112
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,457
Aisha, I.. - Aisha, you'll
certainly progress in life.

113
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,749
No one will be able to stop you.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,457
I love my life.

115
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,999
Your..

116
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,499
Aisha, I'm saying something.

117
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,790
Cheers to you, Aisha.

118
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,207
Come on. Aisha's left.

119
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,457
It rained.

120
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,499
'What can I say about him? '

121
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,749
'He's been my
neighbour since I was a child.'

122
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,040
'At times, my best friend.. '
- '.. and at times, my worst enemy.'

123
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,915
'My Brother-in-law
Karan's younger brother.. '

124
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,790
'.. and our new family member.'

125
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,790
'He's so irritating.'

126
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,957
Arjun Burman, get your eyes checked.

127
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,290
Have you gone squint-eyed?
- It's not my fault.

128
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,665
I've got to look at you squint-eyed.

129
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,207
There happens to be a front
door to get in to the house.

130
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,457
Really? You've
become so smart, Aisha.

131
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:35,124
Oh, God. Why are you
always dressed this way?

132
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,874
Designer suits. Designer shoes.

133
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,374
Stuck up corporate snob.
- Hey, whatever it takes.

134
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,374
Sant Ram.

135
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:49,082
Sant Ram.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,415
Who is creating a racket?

137
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:56,582
It's none other than Arjun.
- Oh, Arjun.

138
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,082
When did you arrive?
- Just now, Uncle.

139
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,082
Aisha, let him in.

140
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,207
You shouldn't treat
guests like this, dear.

141
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,832
Exactly.
- What?

142
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,790
Guest? Since when?

143
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,249
Who gets 'Rasgulle'
(sweetmeats) From London?

144
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,999
You don't have a clue, Arjun.

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,124
I was passing by this shop.
There, I saw these 'Rasgulle.'

146
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,790
It reminded me of your face.

147
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,624
I grew slightly emotional. So,
I bought them for you.

148
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,332
That's pathetic.

149
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,082
Aunt's wedding was three days ago.

150
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,332
What is the point of coming now?

151
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,749
You said I'm a corporate snob.

152
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,999
You know I have work.
Emergency meetings.

153
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,540
But I'm here now.

154
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,582
And yes, one of my
friends is getting married.

155
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,374
I needed to get some
arrangements done.

156
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,749
You know tents, music bands,
and etcetera.

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,790
You've started some
wedding business, right?

158
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,540
Event management.

159
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,957
Are you making fun of you?

160
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,957
No, I'm not making fun of you.

161
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,540
All I want to say is that..

162
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,707
..everyone has their personal taste.

163
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,415
And it's not right to
interfere in their personal lives.

164
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,665
Give me one reason why
I should listen to you.

165
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,790
Because I'm bigger.

166
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,249
What?

167
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,665
Only your stomach's bigger.
- Hey, it's a 16-pack, okay.

168
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,165
Don't hold your breath
too long. Or you'll faint.

169
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:33,624
Aisha is jealous.
- No, I am not, Arjun.

170
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,999
Show yourself out. You
know where the door is.

171
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,207
So irritating,
annoying and self-involved.

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,374
It's okay to think
positively about yourself.

173
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,957
But to consider yourself the best?

174
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,915
What does he know about life? So
what if he's a Wharton graduate.

175
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,915
Who cares!

176
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,040
Lousy investment banker.

177
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,499
I was completely shocked yesterday..

178
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,415
..when aunt handed me your call.

179
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,957
Our uncles are such good friends.

180
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,207
So, it was obvious that
I'd invite you. - Aisha.

181
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,957
Where have you been? I've
been looking for you everywhere.

182
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,665
Pinky, Shefali. - Shefali,
Pinky is my best friend. - Hello.

183
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,332
Hi. - Hi. - By the way, the drawings
are really nice, aren't they?

184
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,999
Drawing?
- Thank you.

185
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,582
You know, I'm an artist as well.

186
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,582
That's why I did a
course in home decoration..

187
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,082
..at Bahadurgarh.
- Wow.

188
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,707
But I had to come here.

189
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,499
Time to get married.
Time to get married.

190
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,665
My aunt is completely tensed.

191
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,999
You're here to get married?

192
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,457
It'll be real chaos if we
don't find a boy in Delhi.

193
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,457
And that too hi-fi (modern).
- Hi-fi.

194
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,540
So, you haven't found a boy yet?
- No.

195
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,082
Families come. They have
snacks and then leave.

196
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,665
And you know they
don't even send me a reply.

197
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,249
But there aren't any good guys left.

198
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,207
All the good guys
either are gay or.. Arjun.

199
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,374
I like this one.
- Him?

200
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,957
But don't worry, I will
find a nice boy for you.

201
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,082
You want to meet my friends.

202
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,832
That's Randhir.

203
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,457
Every mother in Delhi..

204
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,415
..wants her daughter to marry him.
- Really?

205
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,874
Randhir.

206
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,207
Hi.

207
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,290
Aisha, this is just too good.
- Thank you.

208
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,249
Sold. Sold.

209
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,249
We're constructing a
new hotel at Dariyaganj.

210
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,124
I'll put up all your
drawings in the lobby.

211
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,624
What finishing!
- Okay.

212
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,082
Randhir, meet Shefali.

213
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,582
She's a good artist as well.

214
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,499
Remember, at the wedding..

215
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,332
..you spilled wine on me.
- Oh, yes.

216
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,832
So sorry, really sorry.

217
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,332
My hair was messed up that day.

218
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,749
But I also wiped it.
- Sure.

219
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,332
Are you coming from
Chaddha's wedding?

220
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,124
You know Chaddha? I know Chaddha.

221
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,832
He's getting married today.
- Seeing your clothes..

222
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,540
..I could guess that you're
coming from Chaddha's wedding.

223
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,124
You're coming from the wedding.
- Randhir, hi. - Hi.

224
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,624
Congratulations, the artist.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,832
Hi, I'm Arjun.
- Shefali.

226
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,624
So, what do you think?
- You know what?

227
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,457
Very impressive.

228
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,082
If you keep practising like this..

229
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,999
..someday you'll
surely be a professional.

230
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,957
I.. I hope you lose your
polo match. - We'll see.

231
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,540
Aisha, you are coming, aren't you?
- Of course, I'm coming.

232
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,499
And Shefali is coming as well.
- Yes, please come.

233
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,915
You must come.

234
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,082
The dress code is western,
but you can wear anything.

235
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,040
Summer dress. Hat..
You can wear a hat.

236
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,040
Randhir, go get us some drinks.

237
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,082
Sure, sure.
- Thank you.

238
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,249
By the way, do we need to
wear something special..

239
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,999
..for the polo match?

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,415
Don't worry, we'll go shopping.

241
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,124
You've come to the right place.

242
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,707
I'll.. I'll see you later, bye.

243
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,499
Idiot.

244
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:29,707
Om.

245
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:34,874
Aisha, why are you getting
into this problem? - What problem?

246
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,624
Intentional interfering.

247
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,207
Poking your nose.

248
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,082
Why are you trying to
match two mismatches?

249
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,957
We can never turn this
pumpkin into Cinderella.

250
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,207
Aisha, why do you
want to do something..

251
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,749
..that no one else wants to?
- Let's do the 'Suryanamaskar' now.

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,540
I hate this yoga teacher's voice.

253
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,540
Isn't Mallika Sherawat a babe?

254
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,290
I mean she's from Hariyana as well.

255
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,499
There's something
called as grooming.

256
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,082
And Mallika Sherawat has something.

257
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,957
What does she have?

258
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,124
Just imagine what will happen..

259
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,624
..if we make her wear
Victoria's Secret thongs..

260
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,790
..and make her lie
on Venice Beach in LA?

261
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,624
What will happen?

262
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,124
Victoria Secret will shut down.

263
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:09,290
You're one in a million, Aisha.

264
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:13,874
You're so gorgeous, you
make others look pretty.

265
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:18,457
You think there should be
no evil in the world, Aisha.

266
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:22,374
You want to fill every
life with some colour.

267
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,582
Fill it.

268
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,749
You've set out to change
someone's life, Aisha.

269
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,290
Just tell us what this new hobby,
this obstinacy is.

270
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:45,874
You try to solve the
problems of others, Aisha.

271
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:50,332
Try to solve one of
your own problems.

272
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:55,249
Listen, Aisha. Try to understand.

273
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,874
Listen, Aisha. No matter
how much you desire it..

274
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:04,415
Listen, Aisha. No
matter how hard you try..

275
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:09,207
Listen, Aisha. There
won't be anyone like you.

276
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,415
She's easy to persuade.

277
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,665
She gets emotional.

278
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:41,249
First, try to
understand what love is.

279
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,582
It's crazy.

280
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,832
You do as you please.

281
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:50,457
You don't care about the world.

282
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,957
Aisha is one in a million.

283
00:18:54,958 --> 00:19:00,540
She enters your
heart through your eyes.

284
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:06,124
Listen, Aisha. Try to understand.

285
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:10,707
Listen, Aisha. No matter
how much you desire it..

286
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:15,332
Listen, Aisha. No
matter how hard you try..

287
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,874
Listen, Aisha. There
won't be anyone like you.

288
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,790
Aisha.
- Yes.

289
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,957
What is this?

290
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,165
Credit card bill, Papa. - Yes, I
know it's the credit card bill.

291
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,499
But why is it so high?

292
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,707
If you spend money, they're
bound to send the bill, Papa.

293
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:28,374
So much?
- Rs.53,476.43 only.

294
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,540
Only! And what is 'Zest? '

295
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,999
'Zest', Papa. It's a nightclub.

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,040
I wanted Shefali to
experience the nightlife of Delhi.

297
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,582
So, I took her there. - But why
are you giving me sleepless nights?

298
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,874
And what is 'Ensemble? '

299
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,499
'Ensemble', Papa.

300
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,165
It's an exclusive boutique.

301
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,624
If you want to go to
a place like 'Zest'..

302
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,582
..you need to wear good clothes.

303
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,332
And poor Shefali
doesn't have good clothes.

304
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,540
I know, Papa, I should
understand the value of money.

305
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,082
Money doesn't grow on trees.

306
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,165
It's hard to earn.

307
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,915
It's difficult to earn money.

308
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,374
I know everything, Papa.

309
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,540
But for the last time..

310
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,707
..for the sake of Shefali.
Think of her as your daughter.

311
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,582
No, no, thank you very much.
- Two daughters are enough for me.

312
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,165
And if you keep
spending money like this..

313
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,624
..then there won't be any
money left for the wedding.

314
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,999
I don't want to get married.
- What?

315
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,665
I just want a live-in relationship.
- What?

316
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,999
I need to go now, Papa. Love you.

317
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,790
I know you love me but
I need to talk to you.

318
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,749
I hate this..

319
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,874
Yesterday, my aunt..

320
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,499
My aunt.

321
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,165
The one I came here with.

322
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:53,832
The one that was sitting
besides me at the wedding.

323
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,415
What's wrong with her?
- Oh, no. She's absolutely fine.

324
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,124
I was just saying that..

325
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,332
..she showed me
photographs of boys yesterday.

326
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,957
And you know some of
them were really sweet.

327
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,374
Tell me something..

328
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:11,249
..have you seen 'Kabhie Khushi
Kabhie Gham? ' -Yes, I have.

329
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,249
Why? - The dress Kareena
Kapoor has worn in that..

330
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,832
Its neither red nor maroon.

331
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,374
It's some amazing colour in-between.

332
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:23,290
I'll wear the same, exact
dress on my wedding day.

333
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:28,624
Will you help me get it?
- Of course, I will help you.

334
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,290
Thank you.

335
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,290
Only for me, though.
- Okay.

336
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,915
Promise.

337
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,165
Yes. Hello, girls.

338
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,457
I'll get the papers to you.
- Okay.

339
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,832
By evening.
- Okay. Thanks.

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,957
Bye.
- Yeah.

341
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,957
Excuse me.
- Excused.

342
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,499
Someone's got a
serious case of bitchitis.

343
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,790
The polo match passes.

344
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,082
The polo match passes.
- Yes.

345
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,290
Yes, in my office.

346
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,707
So, what do you think?

347
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,915
Isn't she looking cute?

348
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,707
I think, Aisha, let's
change Shefali's name.

349
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,624
Why?

350
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,249
You've changed her completely.

351
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,124
When you've given her a
personality like yours..

352
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,124
..then she should have
a similar name as well.

353
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,249
Let's think.

354
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,874
Aisha, Zaisha, Waisha.

355
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,124
Aisha. How about that?

356
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,832
Are you mocking me?

357
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:50,040
No, you're making fun of Shefali.
- How is that?

358
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,957
That is once upon a
time there was a Shefali.

359
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,582
And now, there's just
another copy of you.

360
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,165
What's wrong in that?

361
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,207
One of you is
enough to take on Delhi.

362
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,082
Stop it.

363
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,665
Get a job.
- What does that mean?

364
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,832
Are you satisfied by matchmaking?

365
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,290
Yes, I believe in social work.

366
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,499
What could be better than
making someone's life better?

367
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,624
And anyway, I don't
even take money for that.

368
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,999
What do you know about girls
anyway? - No, just about women.

369
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,415
Come on, Randhir.

370
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,124
Isn't he looking like the
Maharaja (King) of Jodhpur?

371
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,957
His pants are really strange.

372
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,332
They don't fit right.

373
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,624
They're called 'Jodhpuris.'

374
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,957
And he's looking very nice.

375
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,249
Well done, Arjun.

376
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,374
I'm fine, I'm fine.

377
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,665
Idiot

378
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,749
Its okay, it often
happens in polo matches.

379
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:01,499
Here. - Yes. - Thanks so much,
Shefali. Thanks.

380
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,790
Really.

381
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:07,040
Did you play hockey on the
horse for the first time?

382
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,457
No. Polo.
- Really?

383
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,124
Pinky, don't do that.
- Stop that noise.

384
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,832
You stop torturing animals,
otherwise I'll call PETA.

385
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,874
Come, meet my friends.

386
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,249
Pinky, let's go to the bar.
- Yes, let's go.

387
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:38,832
Everyone. Meet my friend
and colleague from New York.

388
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:42,374
Aarti.
- Aarti, this is.. everyone.

389
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,040
Well, hello, everyone.
- Hi.

390
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,624
How are you feeling now?
- Little injured.

391
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,332
There's a recession
going on in New York, right?

392
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,832
That's why people are
leaving New York and coming here.

393
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,749
Is that why you're here..
Ankita, right?

394
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,999
Ankita.
- No, it's Aarti.

395
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,832
Sometimes people return..

396
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,957
..because they miss their
family and friends. - Excuse me.

397
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,499
Okay.

398
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,499
Shefali, it's done.
- It's done? - Yes. - Are you sure?

399
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,124
Yes. Thanks, thanks.

400
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,457
Take care, Randhir.
- Thanks, Aisha.

401
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,665
Poor guy.

402
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,124
Aisha, will we die single?
- Please, Pinks.

403
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:28,665
We three. I'm single as well.

404
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:42,582
You lost.

405
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,957
You never told me
that we were racing.

406
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,749
You cry so much when you lose?

407
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,957
Come on, Arjun. Come on, Arjun.

408
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,707
What?

409
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:06,040
That New York returned.. Anita.
- No, it's Aarti.

410
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,790
Yes, whatever.

411
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:15,957
Something's burning.

412
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,457
What?

413
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,540
I can't believe this.

414
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,290
Aisha, are you mad?

415
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:26,665
This time around, I think you've
totally lost it. - Chill, Pinky.

416
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:29,499
You have to do it. - What do
you mean You have to do it?

417
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,915
Your plan is really risky, Aisha.

418
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,457
This is so going
to work, Pinky Bose.

419
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,999
Just watch.

420
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,999
Bye.
- Hello.

421
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,207
Bye.

422
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,124
What's the name of the restaurant?

423
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:51,374
It must be around here.
It's a very nice restaurant.

424
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,082
It was right here.
- How long ago?

425
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,582
Two years ago, Randhir.

426
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,207
I'm going to kill her?
- Who?

427
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,457
She came here two weeks ago.

428
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:25,124
God. Oh, no. Oh, no.

429
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,207
Aisha, how can you
ever listen to Pinky?

430
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:30,999
You know her.
- Because she's my best friend.

431
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,665
Behave yourself, Randhir.

432
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,290
Best friend. Look.

433
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,582
There's no network.
- Can you please take a look inside?

434
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,124
Fine.
- Thank you.

435
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,832
But what's the name
of the restaurant.

436
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,832
Randhir, you'll know
that if you go inside.

437
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,249
Okay. Stay inside the car.
Aisha, close the doors.

438
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,207
Don't worry, go.
- Okay.

439
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,082
No network.

440
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,374
Wonder why Randhir
is taking so long.

441
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,957
Yes.

442
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:12,207
Shefali, go inside and take a look.
- I should go too?

443
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,165
Yes, go.
- Okay.

444
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,999
Go, Shefali.
- I'm going. - Yes.

445
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,290
There's no restaurant here.

446
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,082
You will only find
rooms in a guest house.

447
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,999
But.. there was one last week.

448
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,332
Sir, I can guarantee
you there hasn't..

449
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,165
..been one since
the last four years.

450
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,332
Ask why.
- Why?

451
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,832
Because for the last four years..

452
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,624
..I've been doing the
same job in this same place.

453
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:56,290
Pinky Bose.

454
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,124
If I don't teach you a lesson..

455
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,040
..my name isn't Randhir Gambhir.

456
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,290
There's no reception here.

457
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,790
Shefali, please call Aisha.
- Yes.

458
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:09,874
Please. - Fine, fine. -
This is too much. - Excuse me.

459
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,999
Excuse me.
- Yes.

460
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,957
Are you Randhir Gambhir?
- Yes. Why?

461
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:25,665
Restaurant. Here. 504,
there's a booking for you.

462
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,332
I have a booking?
- You're Randhir Gambhir? - Yes.

463
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,249
Look, we've a booking in your name.

464
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,290
Why would I book a room?

465
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,582
You would know that, sir.
- How would I know?

466
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,332
You don't know?
- I don't know.

467
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,832
You don't know?
- What don't I know?

468
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,124
Fine, pay up Rs.2500.

469
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:48,790
What for?
- Sir, I blocked the room for you.

470
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,790
Just a minute, just a minute.
- Learn to speak respectfully first.

471
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,582
Do you know who I am?
- Who are you?

472
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:58,082
The owner of Ever Supreme Sweets,
okay. - So, what should I do?

473
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,999
Do you want to open up a
branch here? Quietly pay my Rs.2500.

474
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,790
Saurabh.
- Saurabh.

475
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,290
Randhir. Randhir.

476
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,665
Aisha isn't outside.
- What?

477
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:08,874
I wonder where she went.

478
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,290
Where is she? - I don't know,
I looked everywhere for her.

479
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:12,707
What should we do now?

480
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,040
I have some money.
- It's okay.

481
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,207
Madam is with me right now.

482
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:28,290
I'll come again tomorrow. - Sir,
you're needlessly getting annoyed.

483
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,999
The room was booked.
- You could've used it for an hour.

484
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,124
Oh no.

485
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,082
Yes.
- I've a flat tyre.

486
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,499
Where?
- What do you mean Where?

487
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,290
Here, in Defence Colony.

488
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:04,249
Near the park close to aunt's house.

489
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,415
I'm in C.P. It'll take me at
least 45 minutes to reach there.

490
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:10,124
C.P.? What are you doing in C.P.?

491
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,874
What do you mean by What I am doing?

492
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,165
I don't know. Please come
here right now. Quickly.

493
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,457
Okay, look, that area isn't safe.

494
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,749
Just lock the doors and
stay in the car. I'm coming.

495
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,790
Listen, Arjun, I'm not going
to wait here for 45 minutes.

496
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,124
I'm walking to aunt's house.
- Aisha.

497
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,457
Is there something wrong?
- Yes, Aisha..

498
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:35,207
I have to go, do you mind?
- Okay.

499
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,790
Where did he hide?

500
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:46,832
He's almost left me behind.

501
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:52,374
Walk faster, Shefali.
- Fine.. fine.

502
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,749
Shefali, please.

503
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,082
Please. No one can walk that slowly.

504
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,749
I mean.. what do you think I am?

505
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,374
I'm wearing high heels and
mosquitoes are biting me.

506
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,915
And it's so late in the night.
- Relax, don't yell.

507
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,874
Aisha left me alone as well.
- Please.

508
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,499
I mean.. I want to go home. - I
mean.. - I want to go home as well.

509
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,040
I don't have any feelings,
isn't it? - No, no.

510
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,999
No emotions, isn't that it?

511
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,332
Just like that..
- Okay, fine.

512
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,624
Let's walk slowly.
- I don't want to go with you.

513
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,832
No. - I can understand.

514
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,124
I can understand everything.
- Please don't scream.

515
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,665
This is a dangerous place.

516
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,332
I surrender.

517
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,707
You can take whatever you want.

518
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,749
My Aunt?

519
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,124
Aisha?

520
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,999
Dhruv?

521
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,415
'Dhruv Singh,
colonel uncle's only son.'

522
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,832
'As a child, studious, spectacled,
bookworm and very boring.'

523
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,790
'And now, hello, hottie.'

524
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,832
Wow.

525
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,874
You were supposed to
come next week, isn't it?

526
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,332
Ok, I can always leave.

527
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,582
And come back next week?
- No, I didn't mean that.

528
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,624
I just meant that you know..
- Should I leave?

529
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:32,082
No. I mean..
- Kidding.

530
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,249
Aunt's asleep. Dad too.

531
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,874
Thankfully. We'll
get a chance to talk.

532
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,415
Come in.

533
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:45,915
Actually, Dhruv, I need your help.

534
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,790
I can't believe that you..

535
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,082
You're the same Dhruv that
would weep in grade school..

536
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,790
..for coming in second.

537
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:04,832
How do I convince you?
- I don't know.

538
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,040
So?

539
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,374
After all that hard work..

540
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,332
..will you at least
buy me a cup of coffee?

541
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,415
Sure.

542
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,624
So, is this our first date?

543
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,582
Do you want this to
be our first date?

544
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,165
Do you want me to want
this to be our first date?

545
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,832
I don't know.

546
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:48,457
Do you want me to want that you..

547
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,040
..want this to be our first date?

548
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,665
Absolutely.
- Okay.

549
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,165
Oh, you're alive.

550
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,332
Very funny.

551
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,707
Sorry.

552
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,332
You know who I met last night?
- Who?

553
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,832
Dhruv. At aunt's house.

554
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:38,040
We went for coffee.

555
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:41,415
After he changed my flat tyre.

556
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,249
Unlike others who
don't come on time.

557
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,374
Fine. Next time, call your
Dhruv when you need help.

558
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:51,874
I came there leaving my party.

559
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,582
By the time I reached,
you had already left.

560
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,915
Party?

561
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:01,499
Please. You're fast asleep
at 10 o'clock every night.

562
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,624
Hey.

563
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,790
Give me the remote.

564
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:19,082
Give me the remote.
- No.

565
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:23,957
Hi, Shefali.

566
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,040
Hi.
- Hi.

567
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,415
We're going to the
animal rights centre.

568
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,582
Animal rights centre?

569
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,207
What happened with you
and Randhir last night?

570
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,499
Nothing.

571
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,249
We couldn't find the
restaurant and you left as well.

572
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,790
We kept walking all night.
- Really.

573
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,499
How romantic.

574
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,165
Middle of the night,
beneath the stars.

575
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,457
It must have been fun.

576
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:01,499
It was fun, but my feet are hurting.

577
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,124
We're here. We're here.
We're here. Move.

578
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,874
We're here. We're here.
- Doctor, a bike..

579
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,207
Saurabh.

580
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,665
Saurabh..

581
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,124
Shefali, you?

582
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,957
What are you doing here?

583
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:30,749
A bike ran over that poor thing.

584
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,790
So, I brought him here
at the Animal shelter.

585
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,624
Not Animal Shelter, its ARC.
- Yes, that.

586
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,624
You look like a true
Delhiite (Delhi resident).

587
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:50,874
And you? Have you
started modelling? - No.

588
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,790
Shefali.

589
00:39:56,041 --> 00:40:00,999
Saurabh, I'll have to go.
- Yes.

590
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,874
Take care.

591
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,624
Who was he?
- Him.

592
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,415
He's my uncle's friend's son.

593
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,790
Saurabh Lamba.

594
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,040
What does he do?

595
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,165
He works in the BPO sector.

596
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,540
Oh, the people who
call us in the afternoon..

597
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,915
..and ask us whether we
need a credit card or a loan.

598
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,457
Come here.

599
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,415
How middle class..

600
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,790
Come on.

601
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:49,499
What is the animal rights centre?
- ARC.

602
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,999
I thought I should do
something for the animals.

603
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,124
Please. At least,
leave the animals alone.

604
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,249
No, nothing. I'm proud of you.

605
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,499
I love animals.

606
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,957
The poor things can't
stand up for their rights.

607
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,415
So, I thought I should
do something for them.

608
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,457
Maybe I should turn vegetarian.

609
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,582
Listen, Randhir is
organising a river-rafting trip.

610
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,290
Are you coming?

611
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,999
I don't know. I'll see.

612
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,957
Randhir is such a
nice boy, isn't it?

613
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,374
Poor Shefali will
look so good with him.

614
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,749
Both the poor things will
be so happy with each other.

615
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:38,999
Everyone is unfortunate for you.
- What?

616
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,499
I mean did you ask poor Randhir..

617
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,832
..and poor Shefali whether
they like each other or not?

618
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:49,374
Of course, they do. I know it.

619
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,749
You know everything.

620
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,499
What does that mean?

621
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,040
You're just dumping
your liability on Shefali.

622
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,374
Are you trying to say
that I am manipulative?

623
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,749
I just want to help them.

624
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,832
You need help, not them.

625
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,999
Arjun, I know that
you think I'm stupid..

626
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,624
..and that there's
no meaning to my life.

627
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,707
But that does not mean that
you constantly criticise me.

628
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,665
Stupid, fool!

629
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,499
Yesterday, he proposed to me.

630
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,415
Who? That mama's boy.

631
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,624
So soon.

632
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,957
When? How?

633
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:44,165
Last night, he called
and was getting emotional.

634
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:47,040
Last year we went for
a picnic to Manesar.

635
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,124
He was saying..
- Just a minute.

636
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:51,999
Who are you talking about?

637
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,582
Saurabh. The son of
my uncle's friend.

638
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:03,040
He was saying I should
say yes or no, first.

639
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:06,040
And then he'll talk
to aunt and uncle.

640
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:07,665
Saurabh!

641
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:15,749
Tell me what I should do?

642
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,290
It's your life.

643
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,707
Do whatever you want to. Lf
you don't value your life..

644
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,124
..then what can I do?

645
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,749
But where is the comparison
between Randhir and Saurabh

646
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,665
Shall we go home?

647
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:30,915
Aisha.

648
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:34,499
'Elle' magazine,
beauty editor, Pinky Bose.

649
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,499
And the weather report?
- Boring.

650
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,249
That chapter is closed.

651
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,624
Shefali.
- Yes.

652
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:45,124
You know, Randhir keeps
talking about you. - Really?

653
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,540
What was he saying?

654
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,374
He was saying, Shefali
is such a nice girl.

655
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,832
She's so hot, she's so fashionable.

656
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:53,999
Really, he..

657
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,249
Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

658
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,165
Shefali, are you fine?

659
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,665
My foot.

660
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:05,499
Please don't bleed everywhere
- It's nothing, she's gone crazy.

661
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,582
Drama queen.

662
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,665
Get some ice.

663
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,957
Sant Ram. Sant Ram.
- Aisha, it's hurting.

664
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,040
How will I go to boating now?

665
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:19,082
Don't worry Shefali,
everything will be alright.

666
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,957
The boat will come
here to pick you up.

667
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:34,540
Randhir, stop it. I hate this song.

668
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,749
Shut up.
- Shut up.

669
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,874
Yes, shut up.

670
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,540
You know, Randhir, Shefali
twisted her ankle badly..

671
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:47,457
..but she still came.
- Really?

672
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,790
Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine now.

673
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,707
It was a slight sprain.

674
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:54,249
Yesterday..
- She fell five days ago.

675
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,790
Even if she had broken her
leg it would've healed by now.

676
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,624
Pinks, stop.
- It's true.

677
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:06,749
"This heart's made me useless."

678
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,707
Randhir, do you know the way?
- No.

679
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,082
No, I don't know anything.

680
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:15,082
I don't know the way. I even
don't know to drive a car.

681
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:17,707
You only know to
make sweetmeat balls.

682
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,957
Pinky, don't insult my family.

683
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,499
I bet, you.. - I don't know
to make sweetmeat balls.

684
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,374
If we reach there,
there won't be any camp.

685
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,415
Randhir, stop the car!

686
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:27,332
What's going on here?
- Why are you in my car?

687
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,207
Randhir, we're lost.

688
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:42,999
For the past one hour, we've
been going around in circles.

689
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,082
We're going to die here,
and it's all your fault.

690
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,374
You're a fool.
- Shut up, you ham.

691
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,124
You know, Pinky, you
look like a bouquet.

692
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,290
Where do you get your clothes from?

693
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,624
Do you make your
clothes from circus tents?

694
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,124
You're responsible
for all the problems.

695
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:59,957
I can't sit anymore -I need to pee

696
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,207
My back's killing me
- And you're driving me insane

697
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,707
Will it make you any less of a man..

698
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,040
..if you ask someone for directions?

699
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:07,540
Enough, Pinky. That's all.

700
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,749
Guys, I've got the directions.

701
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,957
I was begging you.
- Guys, I know the directions.

702
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:16,249
And Aisha, what are you doing?

703
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,582
Talking to
strangers in such a place.

704
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,124
It's dangerous.

705
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,665
Just a minute.

706
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:26,040
Here.

707
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,040
For your protection. Pepper spray.

708
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,290
My brother got it for everyone.

709
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,040
It's really good. It's very good.

710
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:33,707
Are we enacting a scene from a
period drama here? - Let's go.

711
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,165
Randhir, you could've
given this in the car.

712
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,832
Nonsense.
- Idiot.

713
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,165
I'm leaving, Pinky.

714
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,165
Sit in the car if you want
to otherwise I'm leaving.

715
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,999
Oh, boys.

716
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,874
Finally some fun in this jungle.
- Is it?

717
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,499
That's not a boy, that's Arjun.

718
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,457
Welcome Girls..

719
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,790
..And Randhir, hello.
- Hi.

720
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:04,499
Hi. - Hi.
- Hi, everyone. - Hi.. Ashima.

721
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:08,707
It's Aarti.
- Sorry.

722
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,249
You know what? I'll
see you in the tent.

723
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,040
All right, bye.
- Bye.

724
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,165
So, what are you doing here?

725
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,540
Lost your way to the mall?
- What?

726
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:23,499
You're looking nice, Shefali.
- Thank you.

727
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,957
Ready for the rapids?
- Rapids?

728
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,582
I'm a bit scared.

729
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:32,749
Don't be scared. It's very easy.
- I'll show you. - Okay. Come.

730
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,707
Don't worry. I am with you.

731
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:46,707
Randhir.
- Aisha, you left your bag.

732
00:47:54,250 --> 00:48:00,290
Actually, Randhir.. this is for you.

733
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:03,707
Hey, that's me.

734
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,790
This is Shefali, isn't she?

735
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,999
Wow, Aisha. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

736
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,457
See you at the camp.

737
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,165
Game, set, match.

738
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:44,124
The evening's like a flowing river.

739
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:47,290
It's flowing like the waves.

740
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:55,082
It's narrating an untold story.

741
00:48:55,875 --> 00:49:03,332
Somewhere.. desires are awakening.

742
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:11,082
Somewhere.. you and I are lost.

743
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:27,915
We both are intoxicated.

744
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,624
The ambience is serene.

745
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:35,749
The eyes are speaking.

746
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,582
The ambience is serene.

747
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,915
Isn't it?

748
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,165
What is this moment?

749
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:20,415
What is this ambience?

750
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,499
The evening is fading away.

751
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,999
Everything's so beautiful.

752
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,415
Everything's so alive.

753
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,374
Life is bubbling.

754
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,957
There's a glittering
dream in every eye.

755
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:46,915
The winds hum a wonderful song.

756
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,665
We both are silent.

757
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:03,915
We both are intoxicated.

758
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:07,499
The ambience is serene.

759
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:11,749
The eyes are speaking.

760
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:15,624
The ambience is serene.

761
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,540
Isn't it?

762
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:49,290
Aisha, is Saurabh
really not the right guy?

763
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:57,124
Shefali, it's your
choice to say yes or no.

764
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:59,540
But you tell me, Aisha. Please.

765
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:03,832
Shefali, you're a sensible girl.

766
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,290
It's your decision.

767
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,999
Fine, I'll say no to Saurabh.

768
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,374
Go back to sleep.

769
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,749
Okay, I'll say no to Saurabh.

770
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,415
Anyways, what
difference does it make.

771
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,790
What is your problem?
- What?

772
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,832
Shefali is going to
say no to Saurabh.

773
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,540
Who are you to
interfere in her personal life?

774
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:57,749
She asked me for my opinion
and I gave her, that's it.

775
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,374
Yes, but you're ruining her life.

776
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,249
The poor thing needed my help.

777
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,957
So, I just helped her.

778
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:06,415
God, Aisha, Poor thing, poor thing..

779
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,957
She isn't unfortunate.

780
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,790
She's not unfortunate,
understand that.

781
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,582
I'm not your project.

782
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:15,415
Just leave me alone.

783
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:24,999
So, you think that
spineless Randhir is right for her?

784
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,165
Nice.

785
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,165
You're an expert, aren't you?

786
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,707
A man who runs after a
New York returned wannabe.

787
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:35,040
You're so straight. So
straight that you can't even bend..

788
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,957
..down to tie your shoe laces.

789
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,915
So are you, Aisha.

790
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,749
And yes, better tell that
New-York-returned that..

791
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,207
..it's bad manners to eavesdrop.

792
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:47,790
Oh, my God. Shefali, Shefali.
- Randhir. Randhir, save her.

793
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:49,957
Do something.
- Why are you hitting me?

794
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,665
Randhir, go after her.
- Arjun's got her.

795
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,665
Shefali, don't worry.
Grab my hand. Don't worry.

796
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:58,332
She's fine, she's fine.
- Are you a fool?

797
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,665
She's all right. The water
is just three feet deep.

798
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,540
Relax, almost there.

799
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:09,874
I kept drifting, and
drifting and drifting afar.

800
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:14,040
And my entire life
flashed before my eyes.

801
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,290
I thought I'm going to die.

802
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:21,040
And all I thought was, God save me.

803
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:24,415
Please save me and I'll..
I'll completely change myself.

804
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:30,665
I'll.. turn into a really
nice person, promise. Really.

805
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:34,957
Finally, now, I've
learnt the value of life.

806
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:41,749
Such experiences
completely change life, don't they?

807
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,374
Yes, of course.

808
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:46,290
It's such a deep philosophy.
- Yes.

809
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,415
Deeper than the water she fell into.

810
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,290
Wrap this around you
or you'll catch a cold.

811
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:56,457
Arjun..

812
00:55:56,875 --> 00:56:01,874
..you're braver than everyone
in the whole of Bahadurgarh.

813
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,707
You're my hero.

814
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,207
Guys, cheers.

815
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:14,332
Oh, no.

816
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:16,957
Are you okay?
- Yes. - Sure?

817
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,165
So The entire social scene of
Delhi is having a ball here.

818
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,040
Hi, everybody.

819
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:24,582
Hi, Aisha.
- Hi.

820
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:25,999
How are you?
- Good.

821
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,665
When did you get here?

822
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,999
I got it, I got it. I got it.

823
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,415
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

824
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,832
Lucky shot.

825
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:49,832
I got it, I got it. Good job.

826
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:52,957
Yes. Yes. Go and sit there.

827
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:56,165
Why are you threatening me?

828
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,832
Aisha.

829
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,499
Come on. Come on.

830
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,540
Come on.

831
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:13,957
Caught you! - This is too much.
Are you mad, Pinky?

832
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:15,624
Have you gone crazy?

833
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:19,332
I'm not playing with this idiot.
- Randhir, let it go.

834
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:22,165
Forget it. She's crazy.

835
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,457
You play alone.
Nobody will play with you.

836
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,249
Aarti, want to join us?

837
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,582
Me?
- Yes.

838
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,332
Sure.
- Break her face.

839
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,249
Yes, yes, come on. Make
our team better-looking.

840
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,499
What the hell.

841
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:38,374
She can't play.
- Why not?

842
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:41,624
It is girls versus boys.
- And.

843
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:45,415
Let her play. We'll
teach her a lesson.

844
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:47,165
What's wrong? Scared?

845
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,665
Let's just play.

Pinky.. get water for me.
- Forget it, dear.

00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,582
It's a game. Come on.

You okay?
- Perfect.

852
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,165

00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,749
..beating you on the
volleyball court.. Come on.

854
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,624
No smiles left.

855
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,999
This is me.

856
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,165
I was thinking.. You know, we get..

What's up, Dhruv?

Hi.. Shall we go?

Aisha, just mind your head. Okay?

863
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,040
Actually, Aisha.

864
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:41,874
I was thinking of telling you
something for a long time, but..

865
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:44,749
Randhir, I know what
you're going to say.

866
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,124
And I'm very happy for you.

867
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,874
Really?
- Really.

868
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:53,790
Wow.

869
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:05,499
Randhir, what are you doing?

870
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,957
Randhir, are you crazy?
- Yes, Aisha.

871
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:16,124
But I'm crazy for you.

872
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,582
Aisha, I love you.

873
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,124
No, you love Shefali.

874
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:26,749
Shefali? No, Aisha. I love only you.

875
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,082
I always follow you.

876
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,832
I do so much for you.

877
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:32,874
You never felt anything?
- Felt.. what?

878
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:34,624
What's wrong with you, Randhir?

879
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:37,999
You even took that sketch from me.

880
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,999
I took that sketch
because you made it for me.

881
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,957
Of me. Finally, you
made something for me.

882
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:47,207
And.. Shefali?

883
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,999
What have I got to do with Shefali?

884
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,499
She's so uncool.

885
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:54,040
What do you mean uncool? '

886
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,707
She's got more style than you.

887
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,790
Don't be an idiot, Randhir.
- Aisha.

888
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:59,249
Aisha.

889
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:01,124
Aisha, please.

890
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:04,915
Aisha, I know you love me
just as much as I love you.

891
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:08,457
Tonight, under these stars
and amidst these valleys..

892
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,082
..we should be one, Aisha.

893
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,332
Let's just do it.

894
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:17,624
Randhir, I won't do
anything with you..

895
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,582
..even if you are
the last man on earth.

896
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,957
God Aisha, my eyes!

897
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:34,249
Sorry, did the hero get hurt?
- No, and you?

898
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,165
What happened?

899
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,415
Nothing.

900
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:01,082
Randhir was only asking
about the fuel expenses.

901
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,332
I see.

902
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,957
Didn't he say anything else?

903
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:08,707
What else could the poor guy do?

904
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,999
He was tired.

905
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,665
He just went off to sleep.

906
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:21,957
Goodnight.

907
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,332
I was thinking..

908
01:02:34,541 --> 01:02:37,707
..why didn't he jump
into the water to save me?

909
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:52,874
Come out whoever's inside.

910
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,582
If you're suffering from
diarrhea then come out and do it.

911
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:58,915
I need to go now!
- It's me.

912
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:00,624
Randhir!

913
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:03,832
Oh, no. It'll take 40 minutes now.

914
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:07,749
What's wrong?
Suffering from constipation?

915
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:12,165
Fine, don't tell me.

916
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:14,749
Pinky.

917
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:20,874
She said no.
- Who?

918
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:23,540
Shefali?

919
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,165
Shefali. Shefali. How does
her name come up every time?

920
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:37,957
Aisha. I love Aisha.

921
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,415
Sorry.

922
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,332
Come on, it happens.

923
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,040
It happens.

924
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,832
Everything will be fine.

925
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:06,790
Nothing's going to
be fine, Pinky. Okay?

926
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,999
No one likes me.

927
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:18,957
I'll remain single
all my life, that's it.

928
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:26,707
Join the club.

929
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,624
Did you check the tent?

930
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:33,332
I didn't check your tent.
- You should've told me.

931
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,665
Keys.
- Yes, thanks.

932
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,415
Shefali.
- Yes.

933
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,707
You're coming with us.
- No, but Arjun..

934
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:43,415
These are your bags, right?
- But.. - That's my bag.

935
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:51,957
Come on.
- Aisha. - Get inside.

936
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:54,915
I'm going with Dhruv.

937
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:56,749
There are already
two people in that car.

938
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:00,165
Sit in. - Aisha, come back.
- See you in Delhi, Pinks.

939
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,957
You go in the other car.

940
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:04,915
You're coming with me?
- Yes.

941
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,415
Oh, yes.

942
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,082
Just a second.

943
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:17,999
So, Pinky, it's just you and me.

944
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,790
Come on.
- It's destiny.

945
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,582
Hey, you like R.D. Burman as well?

946
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:51,957
Me too.

947
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,415
Are you fine?
- Absolutely.

948
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,665
Absolutely fine.

949
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:20,707
I can't believe Randhir
did that to me in Rishikesh..

950
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,124
Poor Shefali.

951
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:28,582
Oh, God. Aunt, I'm such a big idiot.

952
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,165
What now?

953
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:31,999
Why didn't I see it before?

954
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:35,457
But I always felt it.
- Really?

955
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,540
At times, things are right in
front of us but we don't see it.

956
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,374
It's okay, honey. Don't worry.

957
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,499
What's done is done,
Aunt, but I've decided..

958
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,665
..I'm not going to
do matchmaking again.

959
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,415
Don't blame yourself.

960
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,624
You just wanted to
do good for someone.

961
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:56,957
I know, Aunt.

962
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,290
But Arjun is
fighting with me as well.

963
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,165
So, what's new in that?

964
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,499
What will I tell Shefali now?

965
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:12,207
Tell her the truth.

966
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:16,290
Just be gentle, okay.

967
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,624
Shefali.

968
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,665
Shefali, Randhir's an idiot.

969
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:35,957
Shefali, I made a mistake.

970
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:45,624
In fact.. a big one.

971
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:49,874
Oh, my God.

972
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:00,457
It's okay.

973
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:05,082
I'm so sorry.

974
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:09,082
Did you see the photographs..
- Chopsuey.

975
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:12,249
It's Randhir's favourite, isn't it?

976
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,290
The American one.

977
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,790
Oh, my.

978
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:22,957
Blue.

979
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:27,165
That's Randhir's favourite colour.

980
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:47,207
That's.. Aisha, isn't that Randhir?

981
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:48,790
That's Randhir on television.

982
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,874
Poor Juliet.

983
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:54,832
Romeo ran away in
the first Act itself.

984
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,707
Hi, Arjun.

985
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,874
Hi, Shefali, Pinky.
- Hi.

986
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:08,499
Where's uncle?
- In the backyard.

987
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,582
Can I have some popcorn?

988
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:22,082
Why are you ignoring me?

989
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:26,332
Ignore? Who's ignoring you?
- You are.

990
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:27,749
Are you a kid?

991
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,624
Actually, I'm not a child.

992
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,749
But you've grown up.

993
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,415
Don't think I've
come here to apologise.

994
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:37,374
I didn't think that
you're here to apologise.

995
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:40,707
What if I am?

996
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:42,957
Then you can.

997
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,165
Sorry.

998
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:54,707
Aisha, I can't ignore
you even if I want to.

999
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,249
Because you're always in my face

1000
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:00,707
What can I do? Where are
you taking me? I've to work.

1001
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,665
Beautiful.

1002
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:26,832
What colour is it?
- Green.

1003
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:31,540
Mine?
- Red.

1004
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,957
Mine is better than yours.

1005
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:38,457
Really.

1006
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,624
Aisha, I met Saurabh.

1007
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:46,332
The one I keep talking about,
Saurabh Lamba.

1008
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:50,832
Where?
- I was crossing the road..

1009
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,999
..when suddenly a bus appeared..

1010
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,082
'Aunt. I.. '

1011
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:02,957
'Oh, no.'

1012
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,874
'Careful.'

1013
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,332
'Your.. sandal is safe.'

1014
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:24,040
I swear I thought I'd
surely lose my sandal that day.

1015
01:11:24,416 --> 01:11:25,624
But then I said..

1016
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:27,665
'Thank you, Saurabh.'

1017
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,415
'You know it's my favourite sandal.
- Really? '

1018
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,457
'I bought it at Janpath.
- I see.'

1019
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,665
'Yes!

1020
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,749
'Thank you.
- No, it's a very nice sandal.'

1021
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:41,540
'Buy one for me too if you
find one for boys. - Yes.'

1022
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:46,665
'I play football here everyday.
- Really? '

1023
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:48,290
'With my friends.'

1024
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:52,374
Aisha, isn't he sweet?

1025
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,040
He's also romantic.

1026
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,249
Look. Shefali..

1027
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:02,124
..just because a stupid
boy didn't appreciate you..

1028
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,832
..it doesn't mean
you walk away with..

1029
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,457
..the next guy that comes around.

1030
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:08,457
You will find a nice boy.

1031
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:12,499
There surely is a sweet and
lovable boy for you somewhere.

1032
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:17,499
You just have to be patient.
- Really?

1033
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,749
For sure.

1034
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:29,124
I want to play squash..
- Do you have an insurance?

1035
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,124
Give me one more like this.

1036
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:34,290
Paste it in it.

1037
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:36,040
I like this.

1038
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:37,874
Aisha!

1039
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:41,249
Should we talk to
Randhir about the website?

1040
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,124
He has done web-designing.

1041
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:45,499
Pinky, there's a huge difference..

1042
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,999
..between operating a
deep fryer and a website.

1043
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:50,665
Just imagine what would be written..

1044
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:51,874
..on the poster that he designs.

1045
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:54,499
Come one come all
- Elastic pants a must.

1046
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,624
That's really nice.
- Is it? I made it.

1047
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,124
There's a party at
Chaddha's farmhouse tomorrow night.

1048
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:07,999
Shall we go?
- Of course.

1049
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,790
Dancing is always fun.
- Yes, I like dancing too.

1050
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,415
But we had planned a
girl's night out tomorrow.

1051
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:17,249
Aisha, shall we
invite Arjun as well?

1052
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,707
Then we'll have to
invite Aarti as well.

1053
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:20,832
But Aisha..

1054
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:23,874
Guys.
- So what, Pinky?

1055
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:28,165
If we all go together it
will be fun. - It will be fun.

1056
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:31,957
What's wrong with you?
- Spit it out. Are you a dog?

1057
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:36,707
Sorry, I can't come tomorrow.
- I've a lot of work to do.

1058
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:37,832
Interviews, you know.

1059
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:39,957
You got a job at 'Elle.'

1060
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,874
Look, I'm going to go now.

1061
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,290
What's wrong with her?

1062
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:57,165
She's strange, isn't she? - She
always seemed a bit strange to me.

1063
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:00,040
A bit jealous.

1064
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,957
And she wears such
strange clothes, doesn't she?

1065
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,124
Where should we put this up?

1066
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:08,332
Here?

1067
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,499
Only.. only..

1068
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:08,499
Those capricious eyes
make my heart restless.

1069
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,499
So this is love.

1070
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:17,457
The wait.. makes me impatient.
So this is love.

1071
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:22,665
Memories torment the heart.
The breath feels heavier.

1072
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:25,999
Eyes are filled with dreams.

1073
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,790
You're scared to say it.

1074
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:29,499
Nights are sleepless.

1075
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,249
Frantically you feel
like its slipping away.

1076
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,665
Let it happen.

1077
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:46,790
Fall in fall.

1078
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,290
"Just move it."

1079
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:32,540
If your eyes search
for a beautiful face.

1080
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:35,165
With a desire.

1081
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,374
So you're destination is love.

1082
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:42,582
With your heart in tow.

1083
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:46,249
The heart seems like melting away.

1084
01:16:46,583 --> 01:16:49,665
The body smolders.

1085
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:51,874
The heart beats and
gives rise to desires.

1086
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:56,707
You lose your senses once you
fall in love. - Let it happen.

1087
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:05,499
Fall in love

1088
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,582
Those capricious eyes
make my heart restless.

1089
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,957
So this is love.

1090
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:17,499
The wait.. makes me impatient.
So this is love.

1091
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:22,707
Memories torment the heart.
The breath feels heavier.

1092
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,999
Eyes are filled with dreams.

1093
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,415
You're scared to say it.
Nights are sleepless.

1094
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,790
Frantically you feel
like its slipping away.

1095
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:38,915
Let it happen.

1096
01:17:41,458 --> 01:18:00,915
Fall in fall.

1097
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,040
Thanks.

1098
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:14,790
Give me a drink.

1099
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,124
Hi.
- Hi.

1100
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:23,999
I hope you're serious about Aisha.

1101
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:27,540
Why are you so concerned?

1102
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,624
If it concerns Aisha,
it concerns me.

1103
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,915
Don't play with her feelings

1104
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:45,540
Come on, Arjun. We both
can share her as well.

1105
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:51,707
Oh God..

1106
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,582
What's up.

1107
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,124
Oh my God, Dhruv.
- Is he okay? - Dhruv..

1108
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,832
You act as the most
sensible one around.

1109
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,374
What's wrong with you, Arjun?

1110
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,749
Are you okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

1111
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:22,499
Thank you, Aunt.

1112
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:27,957
Don't worry, dear.
It's a minor wound.

1113
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:30,124
I know, aunt.

1114
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:36,374
Do you like Dhruv?

1115
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:41,957
He's just a good friend.
- That's all.

1116
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,624
Nothing more.
- Aunt.

1117
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:55,124
Aunt, you know..

1118
01:19:57,375 --> 01:20:02,915
..I thought when I start liking
someone it'll change my world.

1119
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:05,790
It'll change me.

1120
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:12,415
Aisha, love is not a tempest..

1121
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:14,707
..that will change worlds.

1122
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:18,249
It's in the little touches of life.

1123
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,290
It is good, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

1124
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,249
I didn't have any training
but everyone says that I give..

1125
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:28,374
..the best massages in the world.
- First-class massage.

1126
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:34,040
Very nice. - Want me to
do it harder? - A little.

1127
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:42,749
Want some salad?

1128
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:47,124
Yesterday.. Shefali
and I were with Dhruv.

1129
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:49,999
And Shefali was applying
ice on Dhruv's forehead..

1130
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,124
..and he was smiling so much.

1131
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,665
He was looking so cute.

1132
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,249
Papa, no..

1133
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,749
Dhruv couldn't come. - He had
to go for golf. - Hello, Uncle.

1134
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,999
Hi.
- How are you doing? -

1135
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,540
Hello, son.
- Aunt Chitra.

1136
01:21:03,916 --> 01:21:07,290
Aisha baby. - Late again.
- Yes, I'm really sorry.

1137
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:09,207
Aisha invited me to
lunch for the first time..

1138
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:11,624
..and didn't even wait for me.

1139
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:14,332
You're a part of our
family and not a guest.

1140
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,040
You didn't bring Aarti along.

1141
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,457
You didn't ask me
to bring her along.

1142
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:20,957
Anyway, she's busy.

1143
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,165
The poor thing must
have lots of work.

1144
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:29,082
Sant Ram, get some white
butter for Arjun Baba.

1145
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,582
Baba Arjun -Little Arjun.
- Right away. - Get it quickly.

1146
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:33,999
Uncle.

1147
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:38,124
Aisha Baby doesn't like it
when someone else gets importance.

1148
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:44,832
What do you mean?
- Let him eat, dear.

1149
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,332
Arjun, why don't
you bring Aarti home?

1150
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,457
Why not tomorrow for
'Diwali' (festival) dinner?

1151
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:52,957
Yes, yes.
- That's good.

1152
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:54,790
We'll get to meet her.
- Yes, yes.

1153
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,332
This is a good idea.

1154
01:21:56,333 --> 01:22:02,707
Beloved keeps me awake all night.

1155
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,249
He troubles me.

1156
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:10,249
My beloved troubles me,
doesn't listen.

1157
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,999
He troubles me.

1158
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:20,040
Beloved keeps me awake all night.

1159
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:23,999
Wonderful.

1160
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:28,499
Excuse me.

1161
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:00,540
She sings well, doesn't she?

1162
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:05,999
Please. It seems like some parents..

1163
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,874
..are showing off their
child who's in kindergarten.

1164
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,124
Baby, read out a poem for uncle.

1165
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:13,665
Baby, dance on the 'Kajra Re' song.

1166
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,582
Baby, go drown
yourself in the river.

1167
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,832
What's wrong with the
ever-optimistic Aisha?

1168
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,874
I've never seen this
cynical side of yours.

1169
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,415
You haven't seen anything yet.

1170
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:36,415
Arjun, ask the
driver to drop me home.

1171
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:38,790
I'll drop you.
- No, it's okay.

1172
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:41,582
I'll drop you. It's Delhi, Aarti.

1173
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,790
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1174
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,457
Where did these two go?

1175
01:23:57,875 --> 01:23:59,540
Is there a curfew in Delhi..

1176
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:00,957
..that she can't go home alone?

1177
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:06,790
Why didn't Pinky come?
- I don't know, Aunt.

1178
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,374
Pinks, I didn't tell you earlier..
but I really, really love you.

1179
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:21,665
Me too.

1180
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,249
Come in.

1181
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:36,957
Look what you made me do.

1182
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:38,874
What?

1183
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:41,457
Sorry.

1184
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:42,915
What do you want?

1185
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:47,457
I want to apply that
pink nail polish. - What?

1186
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,665
I'm here to talk to you, what else?

1187
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:55,374
Why? Did you find some time
from selling Aarti's CD's?

1188
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:59,665
That's what I'm here to tell you.
- You buy one as well.

1189
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:01,790
Why not? I believe in charity.

1190
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:04,290
I can donate 200 Rupees for charity.

1191
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:07,957
You're so smart, Aisha.

1192
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:10,582
I heard that Dhruv
is going to Mumbai.

1193
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,499
What will you do now?

1194
01:25:14,166 --> 01:25:15,290
What do you mean?

1195
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,665
Who will you play squash with?

1196
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:24,082
You were here to say something.
- Yes.

1197
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:28,915
I want to talk to you.
- What?

1198
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,707
Randhir got engaged.

1199
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:36,374
Really?
- Who's the unfortunate one?

1200
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:39,790
Why did you hide it from me?

1201
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:42,915
Because you aren't
interested in my life.

1202
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:45,124
You've other
important projects in life.

1203
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:48,540
Shefali. Dhruv.
There are so many people.

1204
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,457
I'm not interested.

1205
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:52,540
What should I be
interested in, Pinky?

1206
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:56,332
That my best friend
hid the truth from me..

1207
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:59,499
That she's going to
marry a person..

1208
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,874
..she kept insulting every time.

1209
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:05,999
No, no, just stay. - I'll
just be back from the bathroom.

1210
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,707
See, that's why I
didn't want to tell you.

1211
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:15,290
Why do you feel that
only you are right?

1212
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,207
Instead of being
happy for your friend..

1213
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,957
..you're being judgemental.

1214
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,207
I'm being judgemental?

1215
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:24,207
But isn't this what you wanted?

1216
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:28,790
The only difference
is that this South..

1217
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:30,374
..Delhi circus
tent is marrying him..

1218
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:31,749
..instead of that
villager from Haryana.

1219
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,957
What nonsense are you talking?

1220
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,999
Little Ms. Perfect, Aisha.

1221
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,999
Who roams around
with her ugly friends..

1222
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:42,457
..to make herself look better.

1223
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,290
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

1224
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,249
At least..

1225
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,332
..I don't control others'
lives to assert my rights on them.

1226
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,290
Now, please, you may leave.

1227
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:11,624
Hey, are you okay?

1228
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:14,499
Pinks, why are you crying?

1229
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:18,082
I was being insulted. So,
why are you crying?

1230
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,665
First, you did it,
and now she's doing it.

1231
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:22,874
Come on, come on.

1232
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,874
Randhir is getting married now..

1233
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:32,624
..so I have some of
his memories, few things.

1234
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:34,832
But I want to forget him.

1235
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:39,082
I want to destroy everything.
- Okay.

1236
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,832
Which memories do you have
with Randhir? - No, please.

1237
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,457
Stay close to me.

1238
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:44,957
Anyhow.

1239
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:57,332
What is this?

1240
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:07,957
This umbrella.

1241
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:11,124
It was in his drink
on the polo ground.

1242
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,957
It's very difficult to
forget all this, Aisha.

1243
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:31,415
You know, this is from
the river-rafting camp.

1244
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:34,165
He was scribbling something alone.

1245
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:36,915
I kept it safely.

1246
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:40,624
Look, it's so beautiful, isn't it?

1247
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,207
Look.

1248
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,915
And this CD.

1249
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,790
When we were
traveling to Rishikesh..

1250
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,790
I took it from his car.

1251
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:06,249
Shefali, calm down.

1252
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:09,415
Dhruv is going to Mumbai
tomorrow and we're going as well.

1253
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:11,790
You didn't tell me
anything about our plan..

1254
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,124
..to go to Mumbai.

1255
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:18,832
Saurabh.
- Hi, Shefali.

1256
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,707
Papa.
- Yes, dear.

1257
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:24,624
Aisha, he's Saurabh.

1258
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,665
Our Accountant's son.
- Hello. - Hi.

1259
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:28,957
Papa, Shefali and I
are going to Mumbai.

1260
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:32,082
Mumbai? - I want to stay with
Aaliya till she goes into labour.

1261
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,999
Labour? Aaliya?

1262
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:36,207
Papa, not now.

1263
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:41,457
This girl keeps
scaring me all the time.

1264
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:51,624
Hey, sit down.

1265
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,415
Shefali.

1266
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,332
You are going to like it.

1267
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:39,790
They know everything.

1268
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,207
What is this?

1269
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:51,415
Hey Aisha! Where are you going?
We are coming along.

1270
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:53,207
You guys carry on.
I'll be right back.

1271
01:30:58,875 --> 01:30:59,999
Tell me something.

1272
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:07,290
Dhruv is a nice boy, isn't he?
- He is.

1273
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:11,874
And handsome too.
- Yes.

1274
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:17,707
Any girl would be very happy
with him? - Yes, any girl.

1275
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:26,332
Make an exception.

1276
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:27,915
More difficult thing to do.

1277
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:29,999
Good morning, Sleeping Beauty.

1278
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,624
Surprising, you
woke up before midday.

1279
01:31:33,916 --> 01:31:36,624
Arjun, you are here?

1280
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:39,957
Did you get bored
in Delhi without us?

1281
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,457
Aisha, say hello first.

1282
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:46,165
Then ask me how am I doing
to which I'll reply I'm fine.

1283
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:47,832
Let's start from there.

1284
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:51,499
Hello, Arjun. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1285
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,749
Perfectly fine.

1286
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:57,665
So, Arjun, did you get
bored in Delhi without us?

1287
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:02,082
That's not it.
- I'm going to be an uncle as well.

1288
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:03,457
I won't miss this for the world.

1289
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:04,707
It is full.
- Excuse me, guys.

1290
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,374
Shefali, how do you like Mumbai?

1291
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:08,665
I'm having fun.

1292
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:11,915
And especially, your apartment.
It's really nice. - Thank you.

1293
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,999
Yes, Aaliya. Dhruv is
spending so much time with us.

1294
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,457
We're having a lot of fun.

1295
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:20,457
You know, today, we're going
for lunch with Dhruv to the Taj.

1296
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:23,665
And then we're going to
the mall for shopping.

1297
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:28,165
Good morning, everyone.
- Morning.

1298
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:32,832
Shefali, let's go.
- But let me finish breakfast.

1299
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,290
Hi. - Hi. - How are you?
How is the baby?

1300
01:32:37,291 --> 01:32:38,915
Can I pour you some coffee?

1301
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:42,332
By the way.. - Yes. - The
client cancelled. - Why?

1302
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:54,124
Come on.

1303
01:32:57,958 --> 01:32:59,165
Five down.

1304
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:01,457
Five more.

1305
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:05,082
No, no.
- Yes, yes, yes,

1306
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:06,707
Enough, enough.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1307
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,249
Are you okay?

1308
01:33:13,916 --> 01:33:15,374
I need to go to the bathroom.

1309
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,540
Okay.

1310
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:32,332
Hi, guys.
- Hi.

1311
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:40,499
Are you okay, Shefali?
- Toilet.

1312
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,499
Aarti, I'll just be back.

1313
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:52,957
Better?

1314
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:04,999
Are you okay?

1315
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:10,624
Aisha.

1316
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:14,124
Can I say something?
- Yes.

1317
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,957
I'm in love.
- I know.

1318
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:26,415
Really? - Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

1319
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,415
Leave everything to me.

1320
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:30,499
Should we leave?

1321
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,540
How am I looking?

1322
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:34,915
Perfect.

1323
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:37,332
I'll take her to the car.
- Fine.

1324
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:38,665
I'll be right back.
- Yes.

1325
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:46,957
Dhruv.

1326
01:34:58,625 --> 01:34:59,790
I liked you.

1327
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:03,290
But you didn't show
any interest in me.

1328
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:06,249
It's okay.

1329
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:08,582
Life moves on.

1330
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,582
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

1331
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:16,457
I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

1332
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:38,832
Shefali.

1333
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:41,124
I want to tell you something.

1334
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:51,249
Shefali, Dhruv's an idiot.
- What?

1335
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:55,207
First, he tried to flirt with me.
- And when I didn't respond..

1336
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,499
..he went straight for Aarti.

1337
01:35:59,666 --> 01:36:04,290
We'll find a better guy for you..
- No, Shefali. I'm so sorry.

1338
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,707
First, Randhir, and now, Dhruv.

1339
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:09,957
But it isn't your mistake. It's
okay. - It's entirely my fault.

1340
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:12,957
How could I think that
Dhruv and you would be happy?

1341
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,624
Dhruv and I?

1342
01:36:16,541 --> 01:36:19,082
I thought you and
Dhruv would be happy.

1343
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:29,082
Aisha, I love someone else.
- Who?

1344
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,749
The one who is the best.

1345
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:37,915
The one I danced with for
the first time in my life.

1346
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:40,290
The one who looks after me.

1347
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:43,957
And has a dimple here, just like me.

1348
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:48,249
He also saved me
from drowning, my hero.

1349
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:50,207
Arjun?

1350
01:36:57,166 --> 01:37:00,499
But Shefali, you and
Arjun are different.

1351
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,082
He's not your type.

1352
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:04,249
Why?
- You two are so different.

1353
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:06,915
You're not his type, Shefali.

1354
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,499
I need to brush.

1355
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,165
What do you mean by different?

1356
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:17,374
Aisha, what do you
mean by different?

1357
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:23,707
Because I don't wear
good clothes like you do.

1358
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:27,957
Because I don't speak
English like you do.

1359
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:31,540
My father isn't as rich as you are.

1360
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:35,332
I'm middle-class.
- No.

1361
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:38,082
Because I'm a villager, right?
- No, I..

1362
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:41,082
What are you saying?
- You're misunderstanding. - No.

1363
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,832
I understand everything, Aisha.

1364
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:47,915
You never considered me your friend.

1365
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:51,374
What are you talking about,
Shefali? - I'm just a project.

1366
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,540
Cut that poor thing's hair.

1367
01:37:56,958 --> 01:37:58,457
Give that poor thing some clothes.

1368
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,249
Take that poor thing to Mumbai.

1369
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,999
What?
- Shefali, Randhir is nice.

1370
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,457
No, Shefali. Randhir isn't nice.

1371
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,582
Shefali, Dhruv is nice.

1372
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,499
No, Shefali. Dhruv isn't nice.

1373
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,082
Enough, Aisha.

1374
01:38:13,166 --> 01:38:17,499
You never considered
me an equal to you.

1375
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:19,540
Isn't it, Aisha?

1376
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:24,165
One more thing.

1377
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,207
Arjun loves me as well.

1378
01:38:30,083 --> 01:38:31,207
What?

1379
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:36,249
If you don't believe me
then you can ask him..

1380
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:57,957
Aisha. Aisha.

1381
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:00,249
Aisha, get ready. We're
going to the hospital.

1382
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:08,082
Congratulations, it's a baby girl.
- Really.

1383
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:17,874
I have to go to the hospital.

1384
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:20,415
But don't worry, the
driver will drop you.

1385
01:39:31,958 --> 01:39:33,707
She's so cute.

1386
01:39:36,916 --> 01:39:39,874
Anushka, that's nice.

1387
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:42,749
Take good pictures of Anushka.

1388
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:44,999
Anushka or Sameera?

1389
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,457
Didn't I say Sameera?

1390
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:48,457
But Ann is cuter than Sam.

1391
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:52,124
Hi, guys.

1392
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:54,249
Hi.
- Hi. - Hello.

1393
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:56,665
And here comes uncle Arjun.

1394
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:04,874
Smile, Arjun.

1395
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:07,749
Ann hasn't peed on you yet.

1396
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,082
Why are you sulking?

1397
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:10,832
May I?
- Please.

1398
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:21,707
So cute.

1399
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:23,915
Welcome to the family.

1400
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,332
You sent Shefali back to Delhi.
- I didn't send her back.

1401
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,832
It's not like you think it is.

1402
01:40:58,333 --> 01:40:59,999
You had found a new hobby.

1403
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:02,707
A new game..

1404
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:04,915
..other than shopping and
spending your daddy's money.

1405
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,665
Why are you favouring Shefali?

1406
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:11,874
Because Aarti left you?

1407
01:41:13,416 --> 01:41:15,124
You stay in your own
little bubble, don't you?

1408
01:41:17,666 --> 01:41:19,082
Shefali is my friend.

1409
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:20,332
She's my friend.

1410
01:41:21,083 --> 01:41:23,915
You use your friends, understand.

1411
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:27,540
That's not very nice. - I was
just trying to help her. - How?

1412
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,082
By making her shallow like you.

1413
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:34,540
Shallow.

1414
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:37,582
You think I'm shallow.

1415
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,999
You've so much potential, Aisha.

1416
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:45,415
There's so much you can do in life.

1417
01:41:45,916 --> 01:41:48,832
But everyday, you
develop a new hobby.

1418
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:51,124
Social service or animal rights.

1419
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:54,124
Have you ever taken
anything in your life seriously?

1420
01:41:55,416 --> 01:41:56,957
Your life is very deep, isn't it?

1421
01:41:57,916 --> 01:42:00,624
The way Shefali is
my project, I'm yours.

1422
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:04,582
Have you ever thought
anything about nice about me?

1423
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:08,082
You know what? I
don't know you anymore.

1424
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:11,290
I thought I understood you..

1425
01:42:11,791 --> 01:42:13,915
..but now, I feel I
can never understand you.

1426
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:20,582
No, Arjun. You
understand only Shefali.

1427
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:53,749
Get in.

1428
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:08,665
I'm going to Delhi.

1429
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:48,082
I'm so lost.

1430
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:54,415
Why is my heart in such a condition?

1431
01:43:55,833 --> 01:44:00,082
The dreams have faded.

1432
01:44:01,958 --> 01:44:06,499
Thoughts are confused.

1433
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:12,082
The flowers have withered.

1434
01:44:12,625 --> 01:44:18,832
But their colours
still prevail in my memory.

1435
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:24,457
All the sand-castles..

1436
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:31,249
Were washed away by the waves.

1437
01:44:57,208 --> 01:45:01,957
My path was so
enlightened yesterday.

1438
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:08,415
My path was filled with flowers.

1439
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:11,207
Who do I say it to?

1440
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:14,415
There's no one to listen to.

1441
01:45:15,333 --> 01:45:20,165
Why did I choose pain?

1442
01:45:21,541 --> 01:45:26,707
Why have I lost dreams?

1443
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:33,207
But my pain is still alive.

1444
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:41,374
The flowers have withered.

1445
01:45:41,875 --> 01:45:48,582
But their colours
still prevail in my memory.

1446
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:53,707
All the sand-castles..

1447
01:45:54,250 --> 01:46:00,415
Were washed away by the waves.

1448
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:50,332
My first grandchild.

1449
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:55,957
My heart is sad.

1450
01:46:57,291 --> 01:47:02,207
No one's close or far.

1451
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:08,290
It's not the same anymore.

1452
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:14,290
The days and nights
don't feel the same.

1453
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:21,082
The past seems like a dream.

1454
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:27,582
My heart is restless.

1455
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:35,582
The flowers have withered.

1456
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:40,790
But their colours
still prevail in my memory.

1457
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,124
Hello.

1458
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:46,624
Thank you, thank you very much.

1459
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,582
You've got the job.

1460
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:52,082
You've to join next week.

1461
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:23,874
Pinky, I..
- Aisha, I..

1462
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:30,415
May I speak first?

1463
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,790
Pinky, you're my best friend.

1464
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:39,582
And I don't want to lose you.

1465
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:41,874
I really miss you.

1466
01:48:44,125 --> 01:48:45,874
I know you'll never forgive me.

1467
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:52,124
I'm very selfish.
- Yes.

1468
01:48:52,916 --> 01:48:57,124
And self-centred too.
- Yes.

1469
01:48:58,291 --> 01:49:01,499
And slightly arrogant.
- Slightly?

1470
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:06,999
I missed you too, Aisha.

1471
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:11,040
I was absolutely wrong.

1472
01:49:11,416 --> 01:49:12,957
I'm very sorry.

1473
01:49:14,583 --> 01:49:15,999
It's okay, Aisha.

1474
01:49:16,375 --> 01:49:17,707
I was wrong as well.

1475
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,540
I should've told you.

1476
01:49:21,375 --> 01:49:25,624
Randhir is a really nice guy.
- I Know.

1477
01:49:27,958 --> 01:49:30,415
Actually, I'm not the most
beautiful girl in the world.

1478
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:33,290
I'm not the smartest as well.

1479
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,707
But for him, I am.

1480
01:49:40,125 --> 01:49:41,624
You're very lucky.

1481
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:44,457
You don't know how lucky you are.

1482
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:50,332
Aisha, life isn't that simple.

1483
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:54,540
This isn't a fairytale, it's Delhi.

1484
01:49:56,166 --> 01:50:00,332
They are no rainbows, only smog

1485
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:06,249
If you can see one clear
star in the sky at night..

1486
01:50:07,875 --> 01:50:09,665
..then that's more than enough.

1487
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:13,457
Okay.

1488
01:50:13,791 --> 01:50:15,832
I'm sorry.
- Me too.

1489
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:30,040
Hi, Saurabh.
- Hi, Aisha.

1490
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,957
These papers are for sir..

1491
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,124
I'm sorry.

1492
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,582
Sorry for what?

1493
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:48,040
Just like that.

1494
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,165
You're very nice.

1495
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,665
Thanks.

1496
01:50:53,666 --> 01:50:54,999
Saurabh.
- Sir.

1497
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,124
Give it, give the papers quickly.

1498
01:50:57,125 --> 01:51:00,082
Where are my spectacles?
- Sant Ram, get my spectacles.

1499
01:51:00,333 --> 01:51:01,874
Daddy.

1500
01:51:07,041 --> 01:51:08,332
Aisha, I'm so happy.

1501
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:10,040
Dhruv is getting married.

1502
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,915
Dhruv and Aarti.

1503
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:13,915
It's so surprising.

1504
01:51:15,125 --> 01:51:18,249
But they look very
nice together, don't they?

1505
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,874
It's your turn next.

1506
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:32,415
Aunt. I want to say something.

1507
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:34,165
Yes, tell me.

1508
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,957
Did you meet Arjun?
- Yes.

1509
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:43,040
He's on his way here.

1510
01:51:44,666 --> 01:51:45,957
Why? What happened?

1511
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:50,124
Aunt, I..

1512
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:53,874
Give it to him, son.
- Hi, Aunt. - Hi.

1513
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:55,082
Hi, Aisha.

1514
01:51:59,375 --> 01:52:01,374
Tea.
- No, thanks.

1515
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,499
How was Mumbai?
- Good.

1516
01:52:12,291 --> 01:52:16,582
Aisha, did you meet Shefali?
- No.

1517
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:22,874
Why?
- Just like that.

1518
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,832
Aunt, I have to go.
- Where?

1519
01:52:33,833 --> 01:52:35,332
I just need to go.

1520
01:52:35,333 --> 01:52:37,040
Take care, dear.

1521
01:52:37,041 --> 01:52:38,582
We'll talk whenever you want.

1522
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:40,082
Okay?
- Okay.

1523
01:52:40,083 --> 01:52:41,624
Bye.

1524
01:52:42,166 --> 01:52:44,540
Bye, Arjun.
- Bye.

1525
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,582
Sant Ram.

1526
01:53:06,125 --> 01:53:08,499
Papa.
- Aisha, you?

1527
01:53:15,375 --> 01:53:19,499
Papa, dessert? - I felt
like having something sweet.

1528
01:53:20,916 --> 01:53:22,707
Me too. Give me some.

1529
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:30,332
Don't you want to go to Mumbai?
- No, I do.

1530
01:53:31,375 --> 01:53:34,207
Look, don't go if you don't want to.

1531
01:53:34,625 --> 01:53:37,124
You won't get such
delicious dessert there.

1532
01:53:38,041 --> 01:53:39,999
No, Papa. That's not it.

1533
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,374
Then what is it?

1534
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:45,624
12 o'clock in the night
sharing a dessert with papa.

1535
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:49,957
Hey, is everything
all right with you?

1536
01:53:51,583 --> 01:53:54,624
Papa, I think I'm in love.

1537
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,874
You think, or you are?

1538
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:02,624
I don't know. I don't know.

1539
01:54:02,875 --> 01:54:05,790
I really, really don't know.
- I really, really don't know.

1540
01:54:06,166 --> 01:54:08,207
It's 100% love.

1541
01:54:08,791 --> 01:54:11,082
Now, tell me who is he?

1542
01:54:11,708 --> 01:54:13,207
Who is he?

1543
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:18,040
It's Dhruv, isn't it? That dude.
- No, Papa.

1544
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:20,249
Then who is he?

1545
01:54:20,583 --> 01:54:21,915
School friend?

1546
01:54:22,666 --> 01:54:24,374
Someone you met in Mumbai.

1547
01:54:25,166 --> 01:54:26,499
Then who is it?

1548
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,874
No. It can't be Randhir Gambhir.
No, no. Impossible..

1549
01:54:29,875 --> 01:54:33,374
No, Papa.
- Then who is it?

1550
01:54:34,458 --> 01:54:35,790
Arjun.

1551
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:39,915
Arjun? Our child.

1552
01:54:40,166 --> 01:54:42,999
Wow! Wonderful!
What a correct choice!

1553
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,457
Very good. I'm very happy.

1554
01:54:44,458 --> 01:54:46,832
Tell me when did this happen.

1555
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,915
Just now.
- Just now?

1556
01:54:51,416 --> 01:54:54,665
Did you tell him?
- No.

1557
01:54:54,666 --> 01:54:56,415
Then call him right away.

1558
01:54:56,791 --> 01:54:58,749
But Shefali?
- Shefali?

1559
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,790
That Bahadurgarh girl.

1560
01:55:01,083 --> 01:55:04,290
Come on, I've known
Arjun since his childhood.

1561
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:06,165
If you aren't made for Randhir..

1562
01:55:06,166 --> 01:55:09,290
..then Shefali can't be
made for Arjun as well.

1563
01:55:09,291 --> 01:55:13,374
Call him. - But Papa, he's at
Dhruv and Aarti's engagement.

1564
01:55:13,375 --> 01:55:15,707
Then you go along as well. Go on.

1565
01:55:19,583 --> 01:55:20,915
No.
- Look..

1566
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:23,957
..it's very important to
express your feelings, honey.

1567
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:25,915
You have to, honey.

1568
01:55:25,916 --> 01:55:27,415
I know, Papa.

1569
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,790
But what if he.. says no?

1570
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:36,332
A beautiful,
compassionate, kind, caring..

1571
01:55:36,333 --> 01:55:39,582
..and sweet girl like you.

1572
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:43,040
Only a fool would say no.

1573
01:55:43,041 --> 01:55:44,207
Look, honey.

1574
01:55:44,708 --> 01:55:46,165
Kapoors don't brood.

1575
01:55:46,166 --> 01:55:47,915
We believe in action.

1576
01:55:47,916 --> 01:55:49,374
Get up, my brave girl.

1577
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:52,457
And go tell him that you love him.
- Okay.

1578
01:55:52,458 --> 01:55:55,124
Go. Get up. Run.
- Okay, okay.

1579
01:55:56,916 --> 01:55:58,665
"Are you ready now!"

1580
01:56:01,791 --> 01:56:03,749
"Here we go!"
- Keys.

1581
01:56:13,375 --> 01:56:14,582
I love Arjun.

1582
01:56:14,583 --> 01:56:17,374
"By the way. All the way."

1583
01:56:17,375 --> 01:56:20,124
"The life that we have got."

1584
01:56:20,125 --> 01:56:22,832
"It sings. It laughs."

1585
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:25,790
"It's a bit crazy."

1586
01:56:25,791 --> 01:56:28,665
"We fight. We kiss and make up."

1587
01:56:28,666 --> 01:56:31,499
"It's new every moment."

1588
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,957
"It's moody. It's stubborn."

1589
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:37,249
"I have no idea
what to do about it."

1590
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:39,999
"You can't stop us."

1591
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,832
"We fly like the breeze."

1592
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:47,790
"That's our life."

1593
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:51,290
"That's our style. What to do?"

1594
01:56:51,291 --> 01:56:54,040
"If someone minds, what to do?"

1595
01:56:54,458 --> 01:56:58,207
"Everyone's upset with us now."

1596
01:56:58,208 --> 01:56:59,957
..will sing next song..

1597
01:56:59,958 --> 01:57:03,499
I welcome on to the
stage Rocky Bhatia.

1598
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:04,665
Don't want to run..

1599
01:57:04,666 --> 01:57:05,790
Excuse me.

1600
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,999
Sorry, it's urgent.

1601
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:11,082
Arjun.

1602
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:14,624
Arjun, I know you're here.

1603
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:17,915
And you don't want to talk to me.

1604
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:20,165
But I want to tell you something.

1605
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:24,832
For myself and my peace of mind.

1606
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,624
Remember when I
broke the hotel window..

1607
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:32,457
..with the cricket ball at Kasauli.

1608
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:35,790
You said it's your fault.

1609
01:57:36,875 --> 01:57:39,457
When I broke papa's golf clubs..

1610
01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:41,832
You said it's your fault.

1611
01:57:43,166 --> 01:57:45,040
When I failed in chemistry..

1612
01:57:45,791 --> 01:57:47,749
You said It's all right.

1613
01:57:48,166 --> 01:57:50,415
And you turned my 'F' into 'A.'

1614
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,624
And during Aaliya's wedding..

1615
01:57:55,708 --> 01:57:59,457
..when I mixed
vodka into the punch..

1616
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:03,415
..you took the blame.

1617
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:07,040
You would cover up all my mistakes.

1618
01:58:08,541 --> 01:58:11,790
And scold me when we would be alone.

1619
01:58:14,583 --> 01:58:16,249
And I would quarrel with you.

1620
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:26,874
But Arjun, you were with me
in every mistake, every game.

1621
01:58:28,416 --> 01:58:29,957
You alone were with me.

1622
01:58:33,375 --> 01:58:36,457
Arjun, you've shown me
the right path in life.

1623
01:58:38,458 --> 01:58:40,707
You've shown me the
difference between wrong and right.

1624
01:58:42,541 --> 01:58:45,124
You taught me to
endure and to understand.

1625
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,374
You taught me to
abide by friendship.

1626
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,290
And also to love.

1627
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:58,332
Arjun, if I lose you,
I will lose myself.

1628
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:01,332
Please.

1629
01:59:01,333 --> 01:59:03,457
Please don't let me lose myself.

1630
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,332
This is called love.

1631
01:59:21,333 --> 01:59:23,374
You've made me emotional.

1632
01:59:23,375 --> 01:59:25,790
If only people could
understand love the way you do..

1633
01:59:25,791 --> 01:59:28,374
..then everything will
be fine, it'll be perfect.

1634
01:59:28,375 --> 01:59:31,290
By the way, you've given us
the best wedding gift ever.

1635
01:59:31,291 --> 01:59:32,624
The Best.

1636
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:36,665
By the way.. Who are you?
- Aisha?

1637
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,790
I'm Bunty Kumar and
this is my wife Gurpreet.

1638
01:59:43,083 --> 01:59:46,124
By the way, are you
from his side or mine?

1639
01:59:47,666 --> 01:59:49,082
Whose marriage is this?

1640
01:59:51,875 --> 01:59:53,415
Call Arjun.

1641
01:59:53,416 --> 01:59:54,749
Arjun is here.

1642
01:59:56,208 --> 01:59:57,957
Call Arjun.

1643
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:00,499
I'm Arjun.

1644
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:01,957
Your Arjun is right here.

1645
02:00:08,416 --> 02:00:10,082
I'm Arjun as well.

1646
02:00:19,083 --> 02:00:26,290
Aisha.

1647
02:00:29,416 --> 02:00:31,624
I heard everything you said.

1648
02:00:32,333 --> 02:00:37,874
I saw you entering the wrong room.
I followed you, but..

1649
02:00:37,875 --> 02:00:39,749
I'm so sorry, Shefali.

1650
02:00:40,708 --> 02:00:42,540
For all I've done.

1651
02:00:44,125 --> 02:00:48,082
I hope.. I hope you
two stay happy together.

1652
02:00:49,125 --> 02:00:53,749
Aisha, it's very
difficult to find love.

1653
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,957
But if you do find it,
then you shouldn't let it go.

1654
02:01:04,208 --> 02:01:06,665
Shefali, let's go. The
car is here. Quickly.

1655
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:10,874
Bye.

1656
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:55,749
You're going to Mumbai tomorrow?

1657
02:01:58,708 --> 02:02:00,290
You should've told me.

1658
02:02:01,958 --> 02:02:03,249
Why didn't you tell me?

1659
02:02:06,875 --> 02:02:09,582
Will you come down
or should I come up?

1660
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:13,957
Poor neighbours.

1661
02:02:15,291 --> 02:02:17,124
Why?
- Why?

1662
02:02:18,583 --> 02:02:20,790
Because this ladder
has rotted in the rain.

1663
02:02:21,333 --> 02:02:24,124
If I slip, I'll land on my head.

1664
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:28,207
Why, Arjun?
- Because I want to say something.

1665
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:30,457
What?

1666
02:02:31,375 --> 02:02:32,665
Aisha..

1667
02:02:35,666 --> 02:02:39,165
..you taught me to laugh and cry.

1668
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:44,249
You taught me to
endure and to understand.

1669
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:50,540
You taught me to abide
by friendship and to love.

1670
02:02:54,208 --> 02:02:55,624
You know.

1671
02:02:56,375 --> 02:02:57,915
You won't come down, will you?

1672
02:03:00,666 --> 02:03:02,082
Fine, I'm coming up.

1673
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:08,790
But Shefali..
- Shefali left with Saurabh.

1674
02:03:13,625 --> 02:03:14,999
How?

1675
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,999
I've learnt some
matchmaking from you.

1676
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:21,832
But you love Shefali, don't you?

1677
02:03:24,666 --> 02:03:27,499
I love someone else
with my heart and soul.

1678
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,790
It's you. Only you.

1679
02:03:34,416 --> 02:03:38,915
And it always was you.
- Really?

1680
02:03:39,708 --> 02:03:40,874
Really.

1681
02:03:41,541 --> 02:03:43,040
I loved you..

1682
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:47,040
..when you broke your
papa's golf clubs in Nehru Park.

1683
02:03:48,583 --> 02:03:49,999
I loved you..

1684
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:53,874
..when you made everyone's
life a mess with your acts.

1685
02:03:56,291 --> 02:03:59,749
Even when you got rude
because of your jealousy for Aarti.

1686
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,915
And even when..

1687
02:04:02,916 --> 02:04:05,874
..you fought with me on
the sofa for the remote.

1688
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:11,582
Even when we danced the
whole night in the party.

1689
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:14,082
And also when I gave
you a lift in my car..

1690
02:04:14,083 --> 02:04:15,915
..on the rainy night in Mumbai.

1691
02:04:16,583 --> 02:04:23,332
That day, today and always..
i've loved only you.

1692
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:29,915
I love everything about you.

1693
02:04:30,916 --> 02:04:32,624
Your eyes.

1694
02:04:36,666 --> 02:04:38,499
Your piggy nose.

1695
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,624
Your hands.

1696
02:04:50,875 --> 02:04:52,457
Everyone makes mistakes.

1697
02:04:54,458 --> 02:04:59,790
We fight so that we
can make up later.

1698
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,999
My existence depends on you.

1699
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:13,457
If I lose you, I'll lose myself.

1700
02:05:24,125 --> 02:05:26,624
I love you.
- I love you too.

1701
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,582
Want to go?
- Let's go.

1702
02:05:30,583 --> 02:05:33,082
'And a year later, on
Dhruv and Aarti's marriage.. '

1703
02:05:33,083 --> 02:05:35,749
'.. I grew a year older and wiser.'

1704
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:39,415
'So, Shefali got Saurabh,
Dhruv got Aarti.. '

1705
02:05:39,416 --> 02:05:40,957
'.. and Pinky got Randhir.'

1706
02:05:40,958 --> 02:05:42,957
'And me. I realized.. '

1707
02:05:42,958 --> 02:05:45,124
'.. that love cannot
be planned by anyone.'

1708
02:05:45,375 --> 02:05:48,249
'You cannot assert love on someone.'

1709
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:50,124
'You just fall in love.'

1710
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:52,124
'Anywhere, anytime.'

1711
02:05:52,375 --> 02:05:54,707
'And with anyone.'

1712
02:05:54,708 --> 02:05:57,540
Let the drums play.

1713
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:00,124
Say something sweet.

1714
02:06:00,125 --> 02:06:01,999
Let me hear it.

1715
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,874
Let the drums play.

1716
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:05,707
Fill my life with joy.

1717
02:06:05,708 --> 02:06:09,124
Come, dance with me.

1718
02:06:09,416 --> 02:06:12,832
Love's unique.

1719
02:06:13,041 --> 02:06:14,957
The heart's invaluable.

1720
02:06:14,958 --> 02:06:17,832
Don't compare it with wealth.

1721
02:06:20,458 --> 02:06:26,749
Let me adorn you with
the glitter of the moon.

1722
02:06:27,625 --> 02:06:34,457
Let me bring you
home in a palanquin.

1723
02:06:35,166 --> 02:06:37,040
Say something sweet.

1724
02:06:38,916 --> 02:06:41,790
Let me hear it.

1725
02:06:42,583 --> 02:06:45,415
Let the drums play.

1726
02:06:46,291 --> 02:06:49,040
Come, dance with me.

1727
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:07,249
Your fatal attitude.

1728
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,999
It's mesmerizing.

1729
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:16,790
Your vibrant skin
shines like the moonlight.

1730
02:07:17,208 --> 02:07:20,290
I can't get enough of you.

1731
02:07:20,916 --> 02:07:23,915
It makes me restless.

1732
02:07:23,916 --> 02:07:25,749
I would steal you
away from the world.

1733
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:30,624
Surrender my life to you.

1734
02:07:30,625 --> 02:07:32,499
Say something sweet.

1735
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:34,332
Let me hear it.

1736
02:07:34,333 --> 02:07:36,165
Let the drums play.

1737
02:07:36,166 --> 02:07:37,999
Come, dance with me.

1738
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,374
Fill my life with joy.

1739
02:07:41,666 --> 02:07:44,957
Love's unique.

1740
02:07:45,333 --> 02:07:47,207
The heart's invaluable.

1741
02:07:47,208 --> 02:07:49,665
Don't compare it with wealth.

1742
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:58,957
Let me adorn you with
the glitter of the moon.

1743
02:07:59,958 --> 02:08:06,790
Let me bring you
home in a palanquin.

1744
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,957
I love you.

1745
02:08:23,666 --> 02:08:26,665
Look at me once.

1746
02:08:26,666 --> 02:08:32,832
If you look at me once I
will thank God thousand times.

1747
02:08:32,833 --> 02:08:35,832
Look at me once.

1748
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:39,624
I will dedicate my life to you.

1749
02:08:39,625 --> 02:08:45,374
I love you so much. You
couldn't know it till now.

1750
02:08:46,208 --> 02:08:48,082
Say something sweet.

1751
02:08:48,083 --> 02:08:49,999
Let me hear it.

1752
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,915
Let the drums play.

1753
02:08:51,916 --> 02:08:53,707
Fill my life with joy.

1754
02:08:53,708 --> 02:08:57,332
Come, dance with me.

1755
02:08:57,333 --> 02:09:00,790
Love's unique.

1756
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:02,957
The heart's invaluable.

1757
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:08,124
Don't compare it with wealth.

1758
02:09:08,458 --> 02:09:15,082
Let me adorn you with
the glitter of the moon.

1759
02:09:15,625 --> 02:09:22,499
Let me bring you
home in a palanquin.

1760
02:09:23,208 --> 02:09:37,749
Say something sweet.

1761
02:09:53,041 --> 02:09:54,790
"Are you ready now?"

1762
02:09:57,833 --> 02:09:59,249
"Here we go."

1763
02:10:10,541 --> 02:10:13,165
"By the way. All the way."

1764
02:10:13,416 --> 02:10:16,249
"The life that we have got."

1765
02:10:16,250 --> 02:10:18,832
"It sings. It laughs."

1766
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,874
"It's a bit crazy."

1767
02:10:21,875 --> 02:10:24,790
"We fight. We kiss and make up."

1768
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:27,540
"It's new every moment."

1769
02:10:27,541 --> 02:10:30,165
"It's moody. It's stubborn."

1770
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:33,290
"I have no idea
what to do about it."

1771
02:10:33,291 --> 02:10:36,124
"You can't stop us."

1772
02:10:36,125 --> 02:10:39,290
"We fly like a free bird."

1773
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:43,957
"That's our life."

1774
02:10:44,416 --> 02:10:47,415
"That's our style. What to do?"

1775
02:10:47,416 --> 02:10:50,165
"If someone minds, what to do?"

1776
02:10:50,541 --> 02:10:54,040
"Everyone's upset with us now."

1777
02:10:54,041 --> 02:10:56,124
"Just forget it."

1778
02:11:19,125 --> 02:11:21,957
"The story of my heart.."

1779
02:11:21,958 --> 02:11:24,499
"..I want to tell openly now."

1780
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:28,957
"You can't forget it
if you hear it once."

1781
02:11:30,416 --> 02:11:33,124
"This age is dangerous."

1782
02:11:33,125 --> 02:11:35,790
"It drives you crazy."

1783
02:11:35,791 --> 02:11:39,957
"You will know if you will
think why we chose this path."

1784
02:11:40,791 --> 02:11:43,749
"By the way. All the way."

1785
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:46,457
"When it's the
friendship from the heart.."
