1
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,650
Where's Shiv?

2
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,400
It's been 2:30 minutes.

3
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,400
God's impressed.
You can come out now.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,520
If you want to drown,
do it in Budapest.

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
We'll miss our flight.
Hurry up.

6
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,190
3:21.

7
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,270
Congratulations to you too!

8
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,770
No-no...the company's given
him a house.. car... luxuries.

9
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,850
Yes...

10
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,020
Now Kakkads will take over Europe.
Budapest is near London.

11
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,600
The old man is cuckoo, putting London
and Budapest next to each other.

12
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,600
Soon he'll claim that Queen
Elizabeth is his daughter-in-law.

13
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,940
Quiet!

14
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,520
Forget about him and listen to me.

15
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,900
You're not going to drink there.

16
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,940
If you do drink, you won't drive.

17
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
If you drink and drive..

18
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,810
..then you won't date a foreigner.

19
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,270
And if you do date a foreigner..

20
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't marry her!
- Yeah..

21
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,100
Bye, mom.
- Bless you.

22
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,230
Tell Gurmeet Singh I said goodbye.
- Take care, son.

23
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Listen. Come here.

24
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,190
Take your father's blessings as well.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,810
He's an embarrassment.
- Shut up!

26
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,440
Bless you, son.
- Take care.

27
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll get a handsome
foreigner for you as well.

28
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,400
Shut up.

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,770
Insecurity, huh!

30
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,310
See you.
- Let's go, or we'll miss our flight.

31
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,900
Bye... See you.

32
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,480
'Exactly 800 years later..'

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,230
'..the comet Lovejoy is
heading towards Earth.'

34
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,190
'The entire world is quite
excited about this event.'

35
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,770
'Because when the comet will pass...'

36
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,850
You see, bro..my score's 47.

37
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,600
But I am getting hungry for more.

38
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,600
We're not coming back
without scoring a century.

39
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,150
And even the girls
out there are like me.

40
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,020
Free.

41
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,400
Well, they don't charge
a penny here either.

42
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,940
By the way, this is happening
for the first time in 800 years.

43
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,350
Yeah..
First time in 800 years..

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,900
..someone from the Kakkad
family is going abroad.

45
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
What are you saying?

46
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,310
Hey pauper Kakkad..

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,060
Look here..at what
they're saying on the news .

48
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,440
What?
- A comet is heading towards us.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,770
That's not a big deal.

50
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,020
Gurmeet Singh fires a
comet after every meal.

51
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,310
It's the comet Lovejoy
that's coming back..

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,650
..and that too after 800 years.

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,400
And it's going to
pass so close to Earth..

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,310
..that there's going
to be fireworks in the sky.

55
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,150
So give it a 'like'.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,350
Astrology is nonsense.

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,900
Astrology is not nonsense.

58
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,440
They say it's a super
lucky month for lovers to meet.

59
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,400
This month..I'll find
my true love as well.

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,520
What's more, they claim that a month
later it can be seen with naked eyes.

61
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,900
I've always had 'naked-eyes.'

62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
Thank you.
- What thank you?

63
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,900
Where were you?

64
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,230
You took so long.

65
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,480
I've been waiting for a 1000 years.

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,060
Sorry, I don't follow.
- Then follow me on Twitter, baby.

67
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,770
Did you just say that?

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,480
Do you know what day it is today?

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,850
Love-month is starting, baby.

70
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,150
Lovejoy is coming.

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,230
See..

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,560
Comet passes the earth.

73
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,650
Comet!
- Yes, comet!

74
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
It passes the earth.

75
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,730
And love rains only
once in 800 years.

76
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,060
Really?
- I swear, Nancy.

77
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,650
Nancy?
My name is Melisa.

78
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,560
Hi, Melisa. I am Radha.
- Nice to meet you.

79
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,560
Nice to meet you too.

80
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,480
We're going to Budapest,
for our honeymoon.

81
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,480
Accent, huh!
Get lost.

82
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,060
Believe me, I am totally single and..

83
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,940
And just like your beautiful hair,
straight.

84
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,150
Thank you.

85
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,100
No.
- What?

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,270
You...
- It can't be true.

87
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,900
Is this a sign, baby?

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,770
"My move.."

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,770
"My move.."

90
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,480
"My move.."

91
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,440
"Watch my move."

92
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,560
"Watch my move."

93
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,730
There's no way she's falling for you.

94
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,440
Let's make a bet..10 Euros.

95
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,850
750 rupees.

96
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,020
Your loss.

97
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,440
"Little love.."

98
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,900
"Little coaxing."

99
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,400
"Some more.."

100
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,440
"Some more.."

101
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,850
"Watch my move."

102
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,770
"Watch my move."

103
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,020
"Watch my move."

104
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,980
"Watch my move."

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,100
Hey, hold this.

106
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,560
Come on.

107
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,520
Wha.. What are you doing, Shiv?

108
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,350
You can't just jump
off some random bridge.

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,810
It will be illegal.

110
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,060
These guys will throw you behind bars.
- **** them..

111
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,810
We're middleclass people.
We'll die middleclass.

112
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,730
Marry some Sunita,
Name our kids Sunil, Kishore..

113
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,900
..and when they grow up,
they will be bankers too.

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,560
If I keep being 'legal' all my life..

115
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,190
..what stories will I tell my kids?

116
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,270
Don't stop me today my love!

117
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,270
Wimp!

118
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,310
You made me a wimp!

119
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,900
The same nightmare again.

120
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,850
The same weird one.

121
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,850
It's all your fault.

122
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,730
Really, I mean..
who's scared of water?

123
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,400
I can't even drown myself in shame.

124
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,190
Thanks.

125
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,940
"Om.."

126
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,190
So what if I am a wimp..

127
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,270
I am also hot.

128
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,310
Hi.

129
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,810
So what was the poisoned
sweet that 'Ranjha' ate?

130
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,980
Laddoo (Sweetmeat).

131
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,560
Laddoo?
- Indian Laddoo..the Indian Sweet.

132
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,600
Balls.

133
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,230
You're so hot.

134
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,900
You need to tell me one thing.

135
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,480
Is this a sign, baby?

136
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,060
Yes, the neon sign.
- Neon sign..

137
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,020
You're so cute, my tubelight...
I'm saying you're very intelligent.

138
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,350
Come, I'll treat you
to some sweet balls of love.

139
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,190
But why is nobody..

140
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,940
Lots of chocolates.

141
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,480
Huh?

142
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,480
So many chocolates.
- Yeah..

143
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,900
Just.

144
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,310
When did you arrive?
I didn't see you.

145
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,350
Been a while.

146
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,310
I didn't realize, I'm sorry.

147
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,150
No, its okay.

148
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,480
I want milk chocolate.
- Yeah..

149
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,350
What's good here?

150
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,020
Well, you must try
our liquor chocolates.

152
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,900
I swear they'd melt in the mouth.

153
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,100
And our sea-salt caramel
chocolates are just..

154
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,020
Actually,
I just made them this morning..

155
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,940
..so they are very fresh.

156
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
Ah-huh!

157
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,560
And if you like dark chocolates..

158
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,690
..our beans are actually from
Guatemala, so they are really special.

159
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,100
Shiv. I want milk chocolate.

160
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,560
No-no-no..baby, you must
try sea-salt caramel truffles..

161
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,440
They are like..

162
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,980
You just made them
this morning, right?

163
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,940
She just made them this morning.

164
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,770
And the dark chocolates
are very special. They are from...

165
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,940
Guatemala.

166
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,730
Guatemala.
- Shiv!

167
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,520
I want plain milk chocolate.

168
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,270
But baby..Guatemala is very good.

169
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,520
Baby, please sea-salt caramel..
- No.

170
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,190
Baby..liquor.

171
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,350
Baby gone.
- What?

172
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,810
Baby..gone!

173
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,560
Yes.

174
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
For me?

175
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,100
For her.

176
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,520
By the way, where's Guatemala?

177
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,190
I've been trying so hard to find it.
- What happened?

178
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,900
She kicked you out so
you came straight to me?

179
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,350
I would've come anyway...
Now that I've found you.

180
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,440
Hold on.
- How many times have you used that line?

181
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,310
A lot, that's how I got this far.

182
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,730
Can I say something?

183
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,100
Hold on.

184
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,230
You sell sweets but I can see
Your broken heart in your eyes.

185
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,230
Why?

186
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,190
Don't you see the
chocolate bill, as well?

187
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,900
Pay up my 10 Euros.
No fooling around with my livelihood.

188
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,730
Hello.

189
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,230
Hello.

190
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,350
Just 10 Euros for
your sexy livelihood?

191
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,190
You're so cheesy.

192
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,600
Thank you.
- Thank you.

193
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,600
Baby, a part of me
is chocolaty as well.

194
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,480
I didn't say that, he did.

195
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,770
Wait..

196
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,100
You see..this has never
happened with me before.

197
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,480
I swear, this is completely new.

198
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,520
Do you know about Love-Joy?
Once in 800 years..

199
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,060
Hey..I've sold 200 kilos of chocolate
since morning over 'Love-Joy'.

200
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,350
So don't try to use the
'comet' line on me.

201
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,400
For the first time
in my life I am not trying.

202
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,650
I'm just speaking my heart.

203
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,400
So tell me, Pushpa...
- Forget it, Rajesh.

204
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,310
You're just like me.

205
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,150
I am Shiv.

206
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,060
Saira Singh.

207
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,400
Well...you don't know me Saira Singh.
I'm a lady killer.

208
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,600
And enough of this
'playing hard to get'.

209
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,650
Do you know how you were staring at
me? I'm irresistibly handsome right?

210
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,810
You see...I am a player.

211
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,730
Date..coffee..dinner..home..

212
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,060
And, you know.
- Yeah, I know.

213
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
Goodnight.

214
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,520
Why don't you make it a goodnight?

215
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,770
Let's put in a lift in this building.
There are too many steps to climb.

216
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,310
Listen..can't we work something out?

217
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,730
Wait...I'll help you.

218
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,810
Why don't you keep
things in their place?

219
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Hey..hello.

220
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,440
Uninvited guests are not welcome.

221
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,560
You're the uninvited
guest in my heart.

222
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,400
After you.

223
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,310
Have you noticed how
touchy-feely we're getting?

224
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,400
See?

225
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,690
What are you doing?

226
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,900
Coming towards you..slowly.
- Why?

227
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,060
I want to take it slow, baby..please.

228
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,400
Are you done?

229
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,810
What?
- Now leave.

230
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,480
But..I was just..trying
to make you laugh.

231
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,100
Goodbye.

232
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,350
Bye.

233
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,480
So my love..what's up with Kiara?

234
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,650
Don't know.

235
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,810
She threw me out.

236
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,730
Your cheap tricks won't work here.

237
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,020
And anyway,
she's way beyond your league.

238
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,400
Well..something's special about her.

239
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,190
I didn't feel like
it was our first meeting.

240
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,020
Mr. Casanova..don't
forget what your mom said.

241
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,650
No dating foreign chicks.

242
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,650
She's 100 percent Indian..like me.

243
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,600
10 Euros.

244
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,850
Claira... Indian?

245
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Now he is in my dreams as well.

246
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,560
24 hours..

247
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,650
..how can you keep smelling so nice?

248
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,060
Which soap do you use?
- Shower gel.

249
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, that.

250
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,520
You're back again.
- Hold on..why wouldn't I be?

251
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,400
After last night I don't
believe in one-night stands.

252
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,020
I am not that kind of a boy.

253
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,560
I deserve at least two.

254
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,350
That kiss was a mistake.

255
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,900
So let's kiss and makeup today.

256
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,850
Tell me about your family.

257
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,270
You're so random.
You just changed the topic so easily.

258
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,270
You can try, but can't avoid me today.

259
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,020
And anyway, doesn't really matter.
There's no one at your house.

260
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,940
Yes, I don't have parents.

261
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,650
Sorry... Sorry...

262
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,480
Why are you sorry?

263
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Don't know.

264
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,850
One second..

265
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,100
Uncle.

266
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,310
Hello..how are you?

267
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,310
Money.

268
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,190
I want this.
You like this?

269
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,900
Great, you like it.

270
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,270
Oh.. I get it.

271
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,850
Lonely girl..

272
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,440
Planning to get married when
she sees an ideal bachelor.

273
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,900
Well..let me tell you
about my family tree.

274
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,350
I've a lying father..Gurmeet Singh.

275
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,270
A drama queen mother..Gurmeet Kaur.

276
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,100
And I'm their one and only..
- Hero?

277
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,100
Only by looks.

278
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,480
Actually I am a banker.

279
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,650
Banking runs through my veins.

280
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,350
So let's do it now..

281
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,190
You talk too much.

282
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,100
I like the silent types.
- Hold on.

283
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,020
Silent types are scoundrels.

284
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,940
How do you know?

285
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,850
Actually, I'm silent types myself.

286
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,480
Really?
- I swear.. I swear..

287
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,600
Do you know how to spell 'Silent'?

288
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,440
Realy..I don't speak at all.

289
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
I swear.

290
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,850
You know,
I can't stop talking since I met you.

291
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,940
But I swear.. I am enjoying it.

292
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,100
Will you make chocolates?

293
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,690
Now I know why you
chose this profession.

294
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,310
Chocolate is loaded with Kamasutra.

295
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,150
It fills you with lust.

296
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,520
Lust?

297
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,690
Add this.

298
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,690
What are you adding?
- Jaggery.

299
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Mom used to add it.

300
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,690
For energy. Have.

301
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,190
On a serious note,
does this even have any future?

302
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,980
I mean if you had to
be a lifelong Halwai (cook)...

303
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,400
...you could've stayed in Punjab.

304
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,060
Did you just call me a Halwai?

305
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,480
Oh yes, I did.

306
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,060
What's wrong with that?

307
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,690
Why did you leave Punjab?

308
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,810
For you.

309
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,520
Did this line work there as well?

310
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,810
In Punjab,
the line used to begin with me.

311
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,980
Wanna see?

312
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,900
Obviously, she'll need to see.

313
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,350
Hold on.
I'll show you.

314
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,560
Play.

315
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,350
"Oh my cruel beloved,
my temporary cook..."

316
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,600
"You call this a date,
but you keep making chocolate."

317
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,100
"Look at my fate!"

318
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,440
"From the time she
has entered my life..."

319
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,690
"Oh my cruel beloved,
my temporary cook..."

320
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,100
Psycho!

321
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,650
What are you doing?

322
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,690
You've come too close
in just two days.

323
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,900
With you..
I'm different.

324
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,060
I've never done this before, you know?

325
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,560
I know...

326
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,770
I know baby, I'm a catch.

327
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,730
Yeah?

328
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
That's true.

329
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,270
Big eyelashes.

330
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,350
Perfect sharp nose.
Let me see...

331
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,940
Great jaw line.

332
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,810
You are so like the model kind.

333
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,310
Sorry, for being so good-looking?

334
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,730
I am so disappointed.

335
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
Wait a second...

336
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,810
I know why you are with me.

337
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
Why?

338
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,600
This is what you want, right?
My Badan (body)?

339
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,730
Okay, take it.

340
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Badan?
Who says that?

341
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,690
You've got a hot body, hottie!

342
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,480
This youth will be of no good dead.

343
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,100
Come into my arms, sweetheart.

344
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,730
No, let go of me.
Leave me, for God's sake.

345
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,980
Let me get a good hold first.

346
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,310
You're being very dominating,
Shakti Kapoor.

347
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,100
Come here, my Bindu!

348
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,190
Hey Badan, what's happened here?

349
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,900
Where?

350
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,940
And how did I miss this?
- Oh, this... this...

351
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,650
Well, you were busy.
- Oh yeah, yeah.

352
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,690
What happened?

353
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,440
I was shot.

354
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,650
In a bank?

355
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Birthmark.

356
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,310
Sorry.

357
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,770
One second.
Oh yes.

358
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,730
What are you doing?
- Follow me, follow me.

359
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,520
Okay...

360
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,770
Just feel the moment?

361
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Okay.
- Okay?

362
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,440
Slightly intense please.
- Okay.

363
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,480
Go for it.
- Go for it.

364
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,480
Yes.
- Yes.

365
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,020
Yes.
- Yes.

366
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,400
What are we doing?

367
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,270
I don't know about you
but I'm having fun.

368
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,560
It's vibrating down below.

369
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,690
What?

370
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,150
Your phone.

371
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,940
Move, you idiot. Where is it?

372
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,600
Hello?

373
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,810
Hi Maanav!
- Maanav?

374
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,900
Nothing.

375
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,850
Now?

376
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:12,900
Movie? Dinner?

377
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,980
Of course, I remember.

378
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,560
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, you can...

379
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,810
Maanav?
- What? I'm not going anywhere.

380
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,560
Sorry.

381
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,150
Second lane, third house on the right.

382
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,850
You wouldn't have to
hunt if you'd help me shift.

383
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,900
Hello?

384
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,350
What are you doing!

385
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,270
Stop using me!

386
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,150
Why do you keep throwing
me out of your house?

387
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,060
And this time I'm naked.
I feel used!

388
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,940
Shiv, I have a boyfriend.

389
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,310
Boy...
- And he is coming over.

390
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,650
What am I doing!

391
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,480
What are you doing!
- I...

392
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
The same thing you did
with your Milk Chocolate chick.

393
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,850
Bye now.

394
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,440
This is wrong.
Everything was out in the open for me.

395
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,730
Okay, sorry.
Now please, get out of here.

396
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,150
Let's go and tell
him everything about us.

397
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,310
What's the problem?

398
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,400
Tell him? What will we tell him?

399
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,520
That I know you for only two days?

400
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,900
I've seen sunrises with him.

401
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,730
He takes me on long drives.

402
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,520
We have had candlelight
dinners together.

403
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,480
Just a second.

404
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,810
Are you saying this
to me or to yourself?

405
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,730
Tell me.

406
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,690
Hello?

407
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,480
Excuse me,
is this third house second street?

408
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
You think I'm Google... stupid?

409
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,440
Yeah?

410
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,350
I'm Google? Come search.

411
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,020
Go in.

412
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,770
Hello, Radha?

413
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,730
There is no such
thing called love-joy.

414
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,730
It's all rubbish.

415
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I understand, Shiv.
- How will you understand?

416
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,480
She used me and threw me out.

417
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,560
She's definitely not the one.

418
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,560
Correct.
She is not the one. She is you.

419
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,730
She is just like you.

420
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,020
I mean, how many girls
have you done this to?

421
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,520
You are sc**wed.

422
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,690
Shiv, for the first time,
you've met your match.

423
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,560
Shiv Kakkar,
I am proud of your choice.

424
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,900
"I am proud of your choice."

425
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,600
Look at yourself, Mr. Proud.
You're 30 and still without a girl.

426
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,100
Get out of the closet
and accept that you are gay.

427
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,560
Hey Shiv... what do you mean?
- Forget it.

428
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,480
Look, she is wearing such
skimpy clothes and going with him.

429
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
You know what Shiv would have done?

430
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,150
What?

431
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,150
He would have stripped
that guy off his underwear.

432
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,270
See, you are focused
on that guy's underwear.

433
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,810
Come on, now...
- Are you serious?

434
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,350
Let's follow that underwear. Come on.

435
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,400
Dude! What's up, man!

436
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,810
David, my favorite number please.

437
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,520
Oh, you are sitting
on my regular table man. ??

438
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,480
I'll have a pina-colada... virgin.

439
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,690
And what about you, love?

440
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,310
I'll... I'll have a...

441
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,650
Sairu! We meet again!

442
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Badan! Remember me?

443
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,060
Baby, you mind joining them?
They are insisting. Please?

444
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,270
Hello.
Sit, sit, sit.

445
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,480
Say hi.

446
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,400
Hey, how are you?
- Hello.

447
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,810
What a coincidence!

448
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,690
Such a long time.
- What are you doing?

449
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,480
Where have you been?

450
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,060
Still like Champagne?

451
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,400
Sit. Where have you been? Join us.

452
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,400
Waiter!

453
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,850
Champagne, please.
The one with bubbles?

454
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,020
And what is this?

455
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,600
I mean seriously, what is this?

456
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,810
Where's the ambience?
Where's the mood?

457
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,100
Where's the romance?

458
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,350
Come on, guys. I'll fix it.

459
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,690
Waiter!

460
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,100
Two candles please.
The smelly ones.

461
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,770
Scented, you mean?
- Yeah, those ones.

462
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,650
And menu, please. Fast.

463
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,520
I am in a hurry.
I'm very busy, you know.

464
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,730
Keep your volume
down a little, please?

465
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,900
Why?
- Everyone's looking at us.

466
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,690
Excuse me, but get used to it.
I'm a crowd puller.

467
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,770
Tell him, baby.

468
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,350
Sir...
- Oh, right on time.

469
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,480
Very good.

470
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,270
Superb!

471
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,690
Excuse me, where's the washroom?

472
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,900
Okay.

473
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,270
Guys, hold on, I'll be back, okay?

474
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,060
Thank you.

475
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,770
I'll just come from the washroom.

476
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,730
What?

477
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,350
You've never worn such
skimpy clothes with me.

478
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,560
You are seducing him.

479
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,560
What are you doing?

480
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,270
You intend to break us up?
- Hmm.

481
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,520
That too for free.

482
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,480
You can pay me in kind.

483
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,850
Look, it's very important.

484
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,650
When I see you like this,
I get those dirty, obscene thoughts.

485
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,850
Like Saira, the huntress.

486
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,020
Shiv, the Tarzan.
I am getting these kinds of thoughts.

487
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,560
But because I am very
decent boy from a good family...

488
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,020
I am not allowed to think like that.

489
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,150
So what do I do?

490
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,020
Can I be honest?

491
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,770
Yes.

492
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
I swear, I too get
the same kind of thoughts.

493
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,650
Really?

494
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,770
Let's go.

495
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,730
Where?

496
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,020
Loo.

497
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,690
Yeah.

498
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,690
Now I know how decent a
boy you are from how good a family.

499
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,650
Pervert.

500
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,310
Saira...
- Sorry.

501
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,560
You took quite some time.
Shall we order?

502
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,020
You can buy her dinner but
I'll be the one taking her home. Okay?

503
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,730
Saira, who is this lunatic?

504
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,270
And what is he talking about?
- What are you talking about?

505
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,310
What am I talking about?

506
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,100
Yes! Listen carefully.

507
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,400
This girl... she is using you.

508
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,730
What?
- Yes.

509
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,230
What nonsense is he talking about?

510
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,350
Okay ask her, from where
did this other man come from.

511
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,560
Ask her,
where did the first one go wrong?

512
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,770
Ask her.

513
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,440
Maanav... - Don't bother asking her.
She is very confused.

514
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,310
These girls use us.

515
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,190
They stay confused and mess us up.
I'll tell you, dude, they are all the same.

516
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,940
Oh my God,
there are two guys in my life!

517
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,230
She treats one and cheats the other.

518
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,600
Wow, that rhymed

519
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,940
I have gone crazy.

520
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,600
I'm reciting poetry now.

521
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,730
Look, she made you
Majnu and me a Devdas.

522
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm picking up random girls
from streets now.

523
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,060
Baby, you must be thirsty. Take it.

524
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,690
Shiv, it's not funny anymore.
- What?

525
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,770
I didn't promise you anything.

526
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,560
I don't know what happened.

527
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,020
I felt good when I met you.

528
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,270
I had never felt like this.

529
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,980
Hey...
- What?

530
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,810
Since when do you know Saira?

531
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,480
Since my previous life. Yeah, so?

532
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,440
Only since two days.
- What are you saying?

533
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,600
Two days?

534
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,100
We have been friends
since the last two years.

535
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,060
We are in a relationship
since the past three months.

536
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,940
I know her quite well.

537
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,400
I know her mood swings,
her choices, her tastes.

538
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,350
What are you,
a boyfriend or a shopkeeper?

539
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,900
Saira, is this guy crazy?
- Yeah, crazy about her.

540
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,980
Idiot.

541
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,560
You know her since two years, right?

542
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,520
Then let me tell you something,
She's beyond you. Got it?

543
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,770
You show her sunrises, right?

544
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,560
She is the go crazy on
a full moon kind of a girl.

545
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,190
And she snoozes through
your candlelight dinners.

546
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,730
Tell me something, what's
the use of going on long drives..

547
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,310
..to just watch the road?

548
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,730
Yeah?

549
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,810
How can you look away from her face?

550
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,230
She doesn't need long drives,
she needs long walks...

551
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,480
...that too with a lunatic
who falls into a f**king ditch...

552
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,600
...because he didn't
take his eyes off her.

553
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,770
Saira...

554
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,440
Saira!

555
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,440
He's talking rubbish, right?

556
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,730
If he was, I'd have stopped him.

557
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:33,940
Maanav, I'm really sorry, but if I
can feel this then this is wrong, no?

558
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:34,980
Fine!

559
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,850
Saira, you should get this straight.

560
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,560
Your love story is exciting
because I was in the middle.

561
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,770
Really? We didn't realize
it yesterday, right Sairu?

562
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,770
What did you say?
- Nothing, I was just joking.

563
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,770
Okay.

564
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,350
Look Saira, all this
is exciting because it is new.

565
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,650
If I move out of the way, all
the problems and conflicts will arise.

566
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,730
Same old story.

567
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,440
What will you do then?
Call me?

568
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,230
Maybe I'll accept you?

569
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,350
Listen!
- What are you doing?

570
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,980
Baby, follow me.

571
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,230
Before you go, listen to me.

572
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,900
Can you drop my girl to Buda Castle?
She doesn't have any cash on her.

573
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,480
Baby, sorry this has become a
Romeo-Juliet kind of a situation.

574
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,150
He'll drop you home.

575
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,480
Go!

576
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,400
I'll miss you too.

577
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,480
What are you doing?

578
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,900
What a breakup that was!

579
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,350
Poor guy!

580
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,600
"Poor guy!"

581
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,650
Shall I call him back?

582
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,230
"Maybe I'll accept you."

583
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,400
Let me tell you something.

584
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,480
You couldn't have done this alone.

585
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,810
You are the kind of a girl
who keeps stretching a relationship.

586
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,650
Like a chewing gum.

587
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,980
You won't even chew it
hard because you fear hurting it.

588
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,730
I was feeling a little guilty.
- Right?

589
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,900
I too am feeling a little guilty.

590
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,940
Why?

591
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:15,020
Because I am again imagining
you in a huntress' costume.

592
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,730
"Then let's go, my Tarzan."

593
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,690
"Then let's go, my Tarzan."

594
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,270
Now I know exactly how
guilty you're feeling.

595
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:42,770
"You feel like...someone
right out of my dreams."

596
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:48,980
"You're always on my mind."

597
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,730
"Like a gift bestowed
out of the blue."

598
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:05,270
"You're like a sweet craving."

599
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,270
"Feels like you're always around me."

600
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,980
"The sensation that stays on my lips."

601
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:24,270
"I'm crazy... Crazy about you."

602
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,690
"I'm addicted... Addicted to you."

603
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,730
"Why do I keep crossing my limits..."

604
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,270
"...little by little for you?"

605
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:43,810
"You're the melody
that echoes in my breath."

606
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:50,020
"The secret hidden in my heart."

607
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:55,600
"You're my future and my present."

608
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,650
"You're my future and my present."

609
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,100
" It often happens"

610
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,060
"After losing my heart to someone "

611
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,020
"Everything seems so beautiful "

612
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,350
"Now that I've fallen for you.."

613
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,650
"..the effect is such that.. "

614
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,600
"I keep smiling all day through"

615
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:59,190
"Actually...you're love..."

616
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:05,230
"You keep showing up in my stories."

617
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:11,100
"You're the acceptance
hidden behind the denials."

618
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,270
"You're the acceptance
hidden behind the denials."

619
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,940
"You're the acceptance
hidden behind the denials."

620
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,150
Hey Queen, don't come any closer.

621
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,350
You might fall in love with me.

622
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,730
King, you too shouldn't
be looking at me like this.

623
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,940
I am no ordinary thing.

624
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,150
Then what are you?

625
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,940
I am something you should
forever and forever keep with you.

626
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,650
Okay, very good.

627
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:06,940
Tell me something,
isn't one forever good enough? It is.

628
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,980
Come on now, striptease.

629
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,230
Okay, as you say.

630
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,020
"Oh my love..."
- Yeah baby!

631
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,940
"You got me hooked to your love..."
- Why aren't you stripping?

632
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,150
"Where are you going
after making me..."

633
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,350
Strip. What are you doing?
Hey! - Hey!

634
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,980
What have you done!

635
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,190
You killed me.
Your queen just...

636
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,150
Sorry.

637
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,980
Hey, hey, hey!

638
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,690
What!
- Sorry.

639
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,440
Are you crazy?

640
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,190
Give me that.

641
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,400
It was just a story.
Stop being so emotional.

642
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,900
Don’t laugh.

643
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,940
Just a second. Just a second. Wait...

644
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,230
Are you crazy?

645
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,730
Shut up.

646
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,440
Who's Radha now?

647
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,060
You have a thing going
with her as well?

648
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,060
Since childhood.

649
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,650
Talk to me, Radha.

650
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,270
Shiv, have I ever told
you how much I love you?

651
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,270
B**tard, tell me, where are you?

652
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,980
Jewish Quarter,
last house on the third road.

653
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,690
Come over.

654
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,230
Well...come on in, darlings.

655
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,980
She completes me, dude.

656
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,980
I used to feel so incomplete.

657
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,900
Rascal, I knew you are into men.

658
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,730
Where did you find this Hidimba?

659
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,400
Please Shiv, love ignores such things.

660
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,310
But you won't understand.
- Why?

661
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,310
You don't have that kind of depth.

662
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,310
Forget the depth, look at her width.

663
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Where did you find her?

664
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,150
At the Budapest fair.
- What are you saying?

665
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,980
My future got set.

666
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,020
Why is she staring at my girlfriend?
Is she like you?

667
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,940
You sleep at night,
but something keeps you awake.

668
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,980
Yes.

669
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,730
I get nightmares.

670
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:04,060
Of someone drowning,
of blood, water, a stuck chain...

671
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,810
I feel out of breath.

672
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,980
Two bodies? Maybe my mom and dad?

673
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,150
When did this happen?

674
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,480
When I was two.

675
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,150
My mom, dad and I were traveling
In a car… and we met with an accident.

676
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,690
The car fell into water
And mom-dad...

677
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,230
Ever since then I cannot sleep.

678
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,730
I get scared of water.
I get strange dreams and I...

679
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,400
I really miss them.

680
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,690
Wow!

681
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,690
Your life is so deep,
intense and sexy.

682
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:11,850
I mean, there can't be a
story more interesting than this.

683
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,230
I just can't get
more dramatic than this!

684
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,810
And look at me! I am a banker.

685
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,980
My father is a banker.
His father is also a banker.

686
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,520
I mean, I have such
a common man's life.

687
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,690
And my parents are so ordinary.
They aren't going anywhere.

688
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,810
I am so ordinary and boring.
I hope you won't leave me...

689
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,270
Are you crazy?

690
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,650
Stay just as you are.

691
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,100
You don't look good when sad, Sairu.

692
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,650
No...

693
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,270
You know how to win a heart, huh?

694
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,520
King of hearts.

695
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,810
You were once a king.

696
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,150
Yeah, how do you know?

697
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,900
There was once a king and a queen,
but their death came in between.

698
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,020
I'm getting the drink,
you go get cold water to mix in.

699
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,060
Damn that fatso... baby,
don't listen to her.

700
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,020
Okay.

701
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,350
Ask whatever you want to ask.

702
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:18,400
What?

703
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,020
What's your question?

704
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,310
Actually, I've just met Shiv.

705
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,480
We hardly know each other.
But I feel as if...

706
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,440
I was wondering if...
- If he's the one?

707
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,690
Come.

708
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,270
Full moon...

709
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,810
Sun, water, rain...

710
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
First rain after sunny days.

711
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,850
Everything in your
life is about to change.

712
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,600
Someone is going to come.

713
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,900
A prince.

714
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,770
A prince?

715
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,230
Karma.

716
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,480
Things come back to you.

717
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,020
They repeat.

718
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,150
What had happened will repeat.

719
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,310
Only you can change it, Saira.

720
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,100
Who is going to come?

721
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,650
I've already met this lunatic.

722
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,310
Then what was that Hidimba saying?

723
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,310
Holy shit!

724
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,900
I knew it! You are a psycho!

725
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,190
What are you doing?

726
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,650
Come here, I'll introduce you.

727
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:49,560
Introduce?

728
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,150
Come here.
- To whom?

729
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,730
Mom, dad... Shiv.

730
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,350
Shiv... Mom, dad.

731
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,810
Hello, uncle.

732
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,850
I seek your blessings, aunty.

733
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:08,980
Talk to them.

734
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,850
What do I say? Did they ask something?

735
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,100
Yeah.
- What?

736
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,980
They are asking how
much do you make in a year?

737
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,270
I get 22 in hand after TDS.

738
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,100
Sairu, can we talk later?

739
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,560
What happened, lady-killer?

740
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:24,940
Got scared?
Yeah?

741
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,020
Look carefully.
- At what?

742
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,560
Nose, it's like mom.

743
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,980
Smile, it's like dad's I think.

744
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,650
I'm an awesome combination, yeah?

745
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,350
Yeah?

746
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,650
Absolutely awesome.

747
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,060
Wait, uncle is staring at me.

748
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,690
Don't worry, uncle.

749
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,900
I'll handle your defective
piece with utmost care.

750
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,100
Okay? Don't worry.

751
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,690
What are you doing, you stupid girl!

752
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:37,940
She's very beautiful.

753
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,650
Who is she?
- Your daughter-in-law.

754
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,270
It's 10 and she is still sleeping.

755
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,060
Had too much to drink last night?

756
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,270
She is an alcoholic, mom.

757
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,020
She and Gurmeet Singh will
get along so well, I can't tell you.

758
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,020
Good morning.

759
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,730
Good morning.

760
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,850
Gurmeet, Saira. Saira, Gurmeet.

761
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,350
My mom.

762
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:00,940
I seek your blessings, mom.

763
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,060
She also pays respect!

764
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,400
That's enough, drama queen.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

765
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,400
Are you alright?

766
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,100
I'm done for.

767
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:17,600
What happened?

768
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,650
Look at your hand.

769
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,060
What's happening?

770
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,270
Quick to jump into bed,
quick to propose.

771
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,230
Awesome.
- Then what!

772
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,190
Yesterday we met your parents.

773
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,150
Today we met mine.

774
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,940
So now we are kind of engaged, huh?

775
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,440
Are you asking or telling me?

776
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:44,690
Do you have full on attraction?

777
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,100
Yes.

778
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,900
Has this ever happened before?

779
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:49,850
No.

780
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,190
You've answered your own question.

781
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,020
But what if this
'Happily ever after'...

782
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,520
...becomes 'Happy never
after' after some time?

783
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:02,730
You are right.

784
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,770
And you have a great track record too.

785
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,940
What if you get bored?

786
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,730
You are no Ms. Virtuous either.

787
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,850
Correct.

788
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:18,730
Okay so the issue is,
how do we trust each other?

789
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,400
So the issue is,
is this feeling enough?

790
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
No..
- Then..

791
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,480
The issue is, do we get this
feeling with someone else or not.

792
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,900
Oh...

793
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,060
It's like a buffet out here. So find
some new fancy dish for yourself..

794
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,350
..and I'll find someone
for myself. And we'll know.

795
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,230
Hold on.
Ideal bachelor, great catch.

796
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,600
What are you doing?
This is too risky. - Please.

797
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,230
Shiv.

798
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,310
Hi..

799
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,690
I'm leaving. The things
I've to do for her. Just watch.

800
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:55,730
Same here.

801
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,480
That was a big mistake.
Letting him loose.

802
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,440
Somebody looking for me?

803
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,440
I can smell something
burning out here.

804
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,100
Oh you! Hi!

805
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,230
Having fun?

806
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,850
Keep going. My turn now.

807
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,350
Call me.

808
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:43,900
One apple juice, please.

809
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,100
How rude!

810
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,190
I'm not used to people
not turning around to look at me.

811
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,810
So you are one
of those silent types.

812
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,230
You come to a party and
then stand alone in a corner...

813
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,350
Waiting for a girl.

814
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,810
What does someone turning to look
at you, have to do with your beauty?

815
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,520
So that means you are
interested in me. Right?

816
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,150
Right.

817
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,690
Actually,
I have come with someone else. So...

818
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:35,270
Oh. I hope he won't
mind if I hold your hand?

819
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:41,480
Or put my hand around your waist?

820
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,150
What happened?

821
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,350
Oh...

822
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:50,900
You can't dance.

823
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,600
This is a problem tall girls face.

824
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,270
Excuse me! - Yeah?

825
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:58,560
Let's see.

826
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,810
It didn't seem like you
are here with someone else.

827
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,190
What about you?

828
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,400
Me?

829
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,060
I was alone...

830
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,600
Until now.

831
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,520
Openly flirting?

832
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,560
Have you never seen
a pretty girl in your life?

833
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,060
No, I was waiting for you.

834
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,060
Do you do anything else
other than charm people?

835
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,100
Juggling.

836
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,520
Hey,
we have just met, okay? - Okay.

837
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,600
Slow down.

838
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:28,650
Spend some time with me
and you will find out everything.

839
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,230
Oh, mystery.

840
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,270
You guys think that
if you speak less..

841
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,600
..hide a few things then
the girl will stay interested.

842
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,100
Your smile itself is mysterious.

843
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,150
If you can spare a
moment from looking at me..

844
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,600
..then let me
know what you'll drink.

845
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,560
Whatever you want.

846
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,560
Why do you do this to yourself?

847
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,060
Why do you do it?

848
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,270
You got jealous, right?

849
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,730
I mean... you are drinking
alone to drown your sorrows.

850
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,440
You could have joined me.
Stupid girl.

851
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,440
That isn't my drink.

852
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,900
And I am not alone.
Who told you that?

853
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,350
So who's with you?
- I've found someone.

854
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,270
Who? - My kind of guy.

855
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,900
You are such an unfaithful,
characterless woman... - Me?

856
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,230
Him?

857
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,560
Dude, I swear. Thank you so much.

858
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,150
What would have happened
if you hadn't showed up.

859
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,850
Sorry, sorry.
Shiv. Nice to meet you.

860
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,810
It feels as if we go way back.

861
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,440
Me?

862
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,310
No, people generally feel so.
But it isn't so.

863
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,400
So, why are you being so intense?

864
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,480
Okay,
we are childhood buddies. Happy?

865
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,600
We are childhood buddies.
Happy? Okay?

866
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,560
Sorted?

867
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,100
Oh. - Thanks.

868
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,100
Aww. - Cheers.

869
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:50,980
Cheers.

870
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,310
How cute!

871
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,650
You can buy her a drink but
I'll be the one taking her home.

872
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,480
Guys?

873
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,190
It was a joke.

874
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,520
He gets serious very quickly.

875
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,850
Just loosen up, okay?

876
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,900
Baby, I'm thirsty.
Give me your drink. Please.

877
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:16,900
One sip.

878
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:17,900
It's poison.

879
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,400
It was a joke.

880
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,650
Okay, he..
He caught me on that.

881
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,560
But everyone copies my style, baby.
- Please.

882
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,770
Everybody.
- You can flaunt your style...

883
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,400
But I'll be the
one taking her home.

884
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,310
Wow!
You're learning pretty quick...

885
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,730
I like him. - Yeah?

886
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:43,770
He's learning pretty quickly.
Very very quickly.

887
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,520
Zak a.k.a. Zakir Merchant.
Multimillionaire.

888
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:57,900
Excuse me.
Thank you.

889
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,230
I have found out everything.

890
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,940
Are you thinking about him?

891
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,060
Are you drunk?

892
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,520
It's a ladies' loo.
You'll get beaten up.

893
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,690
No, I am not going anywhere.

894
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,770
I am missing you a lot.

895
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:16,230
Anyway, I won't be
able to meet you for a week.

896
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:17,810
Why a week?

897
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,480
Bankers' conference,
Vienna. Sorry.

898
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:24,400
You couldn't tell me any sooner?
- Sorry, I forgot.

899
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,560
Okay. Let's go outside and talk.

900
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,480
What is this?

901
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,770
It's quite noisy outside.

902
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,310
What silent kind of a
conversation do you want to have?

903
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,270
We talk a lot, don't we?

904
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,060
But we don't listen to this.

905
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,770
I think they are both
conspiring against us.

906
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,730
We have no control.

907
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,100
So what now?

908
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:16,770
So now, let's leave them alone.

909
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,520
They are acting smart.

910
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,810
It's all about trust, right?

911
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,400
So let's see what they
do when they are alone.

912
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,100
One week.

913
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,810
Away from each other.

914
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,940
And what if they
don't mend their ways?

915
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,230
Next level?

916
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,770
Do you really have to go?

917
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,560
It's good in a way.

918
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,230
If you don't fast,
you don't enjoy the feast.

919
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,190
"Come to me, my love..."

920
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,730
"Come to me..."

921
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,520
"This helpless soul awaits you."

922
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:25,100
"Come to me..."

923
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,190
"Come to me, my love..."

924
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,690
"Come to me..."

925
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,730
"This helpless soul awaits you."

926
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:40,520
"Come to me..."

927
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:44,480
"The day is about
to come to an end..."

928
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,060
"My heart belongs to you,
my friend."

929
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:55,480
"It is used to your company."

930
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,270
"I am a moon and you are a star."

931
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,560
"Come to me..."

932
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,690
"Come to me, my love..."

933
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,810
"Come to me..."

934
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:32,520
"This is the limit of love.
It has started testing me."

935
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:40,190
"My love has started
to cross all limits."

936
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:47,600
"My restless heartbeat
pleads you."

937
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:55,400
"To embrace me,
so I find peace."

938
01:01:55,810 --> 01:02:02,730
"My only job is to love you."

939
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:10,060
"My idleness has started
serving a purpose."

940
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,270
"On top of that,
even the weather is lovely..."

941
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,810
"Come to me..."

942
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:21,310
"Come to me, my love..."

943
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,020
"Come to me..."

944
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,690
"I've been in love before."

945
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:47,230
"But with you it's different."

946
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,520
"This bond that we share."

947
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,190
"Is the journey of this life."

948
01:02:55,310 --> 01:03:02,560
"Or do we share
an old connection?"

949
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:09,770
"Come to me..."

950
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:17,520
"Come to me..."

951
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,940
How rude!

952
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:04,810
Even I am not used to people
not turning around to look at me.

953
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,650
Using my pickup line on me?

954
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,060
Yes.
- Liquor baron Zakir Merchant.

955
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:21,350
Awesome.
Must have been quite an impression.

956
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:26,100
You did research on me?

957
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,900
Are you following me?

958
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:40,310
That day you bought me a drink
so now you want chocolates for free?

959
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,310
Disgusting.

960
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,440
You are such
a big business tycoon.

961
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,270
I'd think you'd be able to afford them.
- Afford?

962
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,850
I can even afford a car.

963
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:53,810
But then how would I
enjoy this walk with you?

964
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:03,060
How will this work
if you too keep quiet?

965
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,270
I am already the silent type.

966
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,440
Who comes to a party and...

967
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,440
Personality problem.

968
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:16,100
Mysterious smile?

969
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:23,350
And I want to make chocolates.

970
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,060
Have our personalities exchanged?

971
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,100
You're damn strange, man.

972
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:30,310
It's hard to figure you out.

973
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:34,350
That means you are
trying to figure me out.

974
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,350
Actually, yes.

975
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,480
Yes?

976
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,400
I think we should
do business together.

977
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,520
What say?
- No.

978
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,350
But liquor and
chocolates get along.

979
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,400
They do.
- So then?

980
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,810
It'll be difficult to focus.

981
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,100
For you.

982
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,480
Doesn't that
sound like a Hindi song?

983
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:08,520
"A girl walking in the rain."
- Yeah!

984
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,310
"Sleepless on a sleepy night."

985
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,310
"She met a stranger."

986
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,520
"Unaware of the danger."

987
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,150
"Tell me, how is that fair?"

988
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:22,600
Oh shit!

989
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,270
You see...

990
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,020
You are lucky.
- Yeah.

991
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,190
You got yourself a date
With me in the rain.

992
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,440
A walk with me feels
like a date to you?

993
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:39,310
No, not really.

994
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,190
There should be a
sunset for a proper date.

995
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:47,650
And flowers.

996
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,350
A light drizzle...

997
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:55,400
Soft music...

998
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,350
A long walk...

999
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,100
And endless conversations.

1000
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,310
Conversations.

1001
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,980
And what if it starts
pouring down heavily?

1002
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:08,810
Then?

1003
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,480
What happened?

1004
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,100
This car can accommodate
your dilemma, as well.

1005
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,730
Sorry. Take your time.

1006
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,400
Keep getting wet.

1007
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,230
Dilemma.

1008
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:45,190
"She's completely
drenched from head to toe."

1009
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:50,310
"She's definitely a little crazy."

1010
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:52,900
Are you alright?
- Yes..

1011
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:55,150
Hey.

1012
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,480
My friend Saira. - Hi.

1013
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,190
Wine. - Sure.

1014
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,190
Yeah...perfect.

1015
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:08,440
Did you hear that? - What?

1016
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,730
Drinks are on the house.

1017
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,270
It was planned?

1018
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,310
Don't tell God.

1019
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,020
I made it rain.

1020
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,520
Honestly.

1021
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:26,520
Shut up.

1022
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,310
I sleep with one light on.

1023
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,060
I sleep with all lights on.

1024
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,560
Really?
- Yeah.

1025
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,150
I talk to my plants.

1026
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,480
I didn't talk
till the age of seven.

1027
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:44,150
What?
- Yes.

1028
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,400
Not even a word.

1029
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:47,310
That's weird.

1030
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:48,770
Yeah.

1031
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:55,480
I think I have
seen you in my dreams.

1032
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,440
Same here.

1033
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:58,940
Just shut up now, please.
- No!

1034
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:01,810
I think you are the most
beautiful girl in the world.

1035
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,270
You're hungry?

1036
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,900
I never thought
I'd be here with you.

1037
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,270
Seriously.

1038
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,310
I have never felt this way.

1039
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,940
I would have never
known if I hadn't met you.

1040
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,400
I'm soaring!

1041
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,230
You know you totally get me.

1042
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,520
It's weird.

1043
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,440
You are so my type.

1044
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,230
Mysterious.

1045
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,440
Stylish, cool.

1046
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:50,190
A little crazy, but not bad.

1047
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,270
This is the kind of boy I wanted.

1048
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,850
But this...

1049
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:04,810
Actually before I met him,
I didn't know what I wanted.

1050
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:08,150
Now it doesn't listen to me.

1051
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:11,600
It belongs to him.

1052
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,810
Shiv.

1053
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:18,060
Ya.

1054
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,520
Sure?

1055
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,940
About that Shiv?

1056
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,520
Sure?

1057
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:33,730
Sure.

1058
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,730
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1059
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,230
May he die in his sleep.

1060
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,350
Shut up.
- I'm sorry.

1061
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,060
So last one and
I'll drop you home.

1062
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:55,730
"Intoxicated and swaying..."

1063
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,310
"In this lonely rainy night."

1064
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:09,560
"Tell me, how is that fair?"

1065
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,480
Kill him.

1066
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:32,770
Good morning.
- What the hell, Zak?

1067
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,650
What?
- Where am I?

1068
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:35,850
With me.

1069
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,940
In my world.

1070
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,230
What do you mean?

1071
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:40,520
How could you bring me here?

1072
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,020
I asked...

1073
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,560
But you didn't reply.

1074
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:48,810
Obviously, I was drunk, right?

1075
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,230
Just a second.
What did you mix in my drink?

1076
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,730
It took me 25 years to find you.

1077
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:56,770
What?

1078
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,850
What if I tell you
that we've met before?

1079
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:07,100
What if I tell you there was a time
when we loved each other like crazy?

1080
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:09,900
And then someone separated us.

1081
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,600
What would you say to that?

1082
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,560
Then I'd say that you have
gone crazy and you need help.

1083
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:18,690
No. No.
I am not crazy.

1084
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,520
Doctors too used to say the same.

1085
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,440
They were treating me.

1086
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,400
They were trying to erase
the image from my mind.

1087
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,520
But how could I forget you?

1088
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,100
I found you.

1089
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,150
All the questions became meaningless.

1090
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,150
My existence is for you.

1091
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:39,600
This is what the universe wants.
- Just leave me. Let me go.

1092
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,230
Wait Saira, wait! I am not crazy.
- Leave me. Let me go, you psycho.

1093
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,310
I'm not..

1094
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,020
I'm not psycho.

1095
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,650
You don't believe me.
Come here.

1096
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:51,770
Just let me go.

1097
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,900
Look!

1098
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,690
Look at them.

1099
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,520
That's you, age 6.

1100
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,350
Right?

1101
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,060
And this one...

1102
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,650
Look at this..

1103
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:20,850
This is you, age 18.

1104
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:23,770
I tried.

1105
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,230
The nose is a little..

1106
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:29,060
What are you saying?
I have never met you before.

1107
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,350
But the smile is the same.
- You're crazy.

1108
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,060
Saira, am I right?
- I have to go just...

1109
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:35,400
I'm going to call the cops. I'm going to..
- Saira!

1110
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,230
Saira!

1111
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,350
Don't you want answers to your dreams?

1112
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,900
It will take some time.

1113
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,190
But you will understand everything.

1114
01:15:55,690 --> 01:16:01,690
And until then, be my guest.

1115
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,350
It's perfect.

1116
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,810
Dinner will be at 8.

1117
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:16,690
"Come to me, my love..."

1118
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:20,230
"Come to me..."

1119
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:24,150
"This helpless soul awaits you."

1120
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,600
"Come to me..."

1121
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:31,560
"Come to me, my love..."

1122
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:35,060
"Come to me..."

1123
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,900
You really don't know anything?

1124
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,190
She isn't at home and she
isn't even answering her phone.

1125
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,520
What's this?
- Read it.

1126
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,770
You want to fast some more?
Look who finally took her home.

1127
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,020
Girls want princes not paupers.

1128
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,810
Hey, hey, hey!

1129
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:03,730
Brother! Brother! What is it?
- You want money? I have money.

1130
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:19,560
"Come to me, my love..."

1131
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:28,190
"Come to me, my love..."

1132
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,690
Oh! Hi!

1133
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,770
You want something?

1134
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,900
No appreciation.

1135
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:52,980
Don't come any closer.

1136
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:55,730
Saira... what are you doing?

1137
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,520
Come down.

1138
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:01,650
Don't come any closer or I'll jump.

1139
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,520
Oh come on, Saira.

1140
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,520
You know you won't jump.

1141
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:19,900
Saira...

1142
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,730
You stay here.

1143
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,350
No!

1144
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,310
Why did you target my prey?

1145
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:06,020
Because Saiba was confronting
a tiger with a dagger.

1146
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,310
The tiger didn't even
have a dagger, Kaabir.

1147
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:18,770
It's my duty to protect Saiba.

1148
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,060
Paathar belongs to me.

1149
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:31,060
You have to either
drown or fly to reach here.

1150
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,020
I don't want anyone's help.

1151
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,480
It's beautiful.

1152
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:46,440
I fear someone might cast an evil eye.

1153
01:23:55,400 --> 01:24:02,060
Kaabir… there's news that Muraaki
Jilaan has set his eyes on our Paathar.

1154
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:03,350
Jilaan?

1155
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:32,230
Muwaqqit,
we wish to conquer the world...

1156
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,900
Why this sudden move
towards measly Paathar?

1157
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:42,060
A world unseen,
unheard and unapproachable...

1158
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,230
Muraakis are the ones
who conquer them all.

1159
01:24:56,810 --> 01:25:00,850
Muraakis have dared
to set their eyes on our Paathar.

1160
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,520
Whether he rips the sky apart
or makes his way through water...

1161
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,650
Jilaan is destined
to die in Paathar's waters.

1162
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:10,150
If he was born on a no moon night...

1163
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,100
...then we are that dark night.

1164
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,520
The one who dares to confront us,
is headed to his destruction.

1165
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:16,150
Water should stay blue, not turn red.

1166
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,810
Jilaan has sent just
one Muraaki to fight us?

1167
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,650
Just one.

1168
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,270
Muraaki!

1169
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,100
Muraaki!

1170
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:30,400
Either surrender before
the full moon night or die.

1171
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,400
Jilaan.

1172
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,520
Saiba wishes to fight the
war the warriors of Paathar couldn't?

1173
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:36,100
You don't just fight wars,
you also strategize them.

1174
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:23,850
Saiba.

1175
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:31,810
We buried their warriors
so the Paathars sent women?

1176
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,650
It's a woman
who shall kill Jilaan.

1177
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,690
Muraakis give only one chance.

1178
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:45,940
This full moon night,
we shall conquer Paatharghat.

1179
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:03,150
Conquer me,
and you conquer Paatharghat.

1180
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:11,850
Who are you?

1181
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:16,770
Doom.

1182
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:35,600
Barbaric Muraaki, you have never
been this close to a woman, have you?

1183
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,190
Get lost.

1184
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:44,650
I've come to kill you.

1185
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,310
You will have to defeat
me to win me over.

1186
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:22,940
Show me your face.

1187
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:26,020
Why do you need to see
my face to fight with me?

1188
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,350
I need a reason to fight.

1189
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,060
Then lower your gaze.

1190
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:35,980
Why?

1191
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:40,310
Saiba's beauty is like the sun…

1192
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,600
It's wise to lower your gaze.

1193
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,310
You got a reason to fight.

1194
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,650
Now do you have
the courage to fight?

1195
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:24,400
Just her and me.

1196
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,400
Jungle Trap.

1197
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,020
This is your Paathar's dense jungle.

1198
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,900
A huge tree at the end.

1199
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:47,230
And a dagger on the top.

1200
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,900
The first one to get
the dagger gets to draw blood.

1201
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:02,690
If I draw your blood,
you give up on Paathar.

1202
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:12,600
And what if I draw yours?

1203
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,940
My Ghat will belong
to you and so will I.

1204
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,020
Jungle Trap.

1205
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:27,020
100 paths, 100 wrong ones.

1206
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:39,980
Then the wrong one it is.

1207
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,980
When in the jungle, protect your life,
Not your pride.

1208
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:18,150
I'm sharper than the dagger.
Watch your step.

1209
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:34,940
What's your intention?

1210
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:36,100
Doom.

1211
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,350
I knew that Muraakis' brains
are below their waist.

1212
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,560
Accept defeat.

1213
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:55,480
My next strike might kill you.

1214
01:35:58,690 --> 01:36:00,650
Try to not kill yourself.

1215
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:02,940
For me.

1216
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,440
Kill me.

1217
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,730
I cannot stay here.

1218
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,060
I won't be able to go back.

1219
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:52,400
We let Paathar go,
Saiba is now ours.

1220
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,270
He cannot be defeated
even by a beast…

1221
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,600
A Muraaki can be
killed only by deceit.

1222
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,770
Saiba is yours.

1223
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,560
First we marry.

1224
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:26,690
Jilaan loves wars,
then why this marriage?

1225
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:35,730
Oh Muwaqqit, what do you
gain by conquering the world?

1226
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,480
Bodies meet, bodies perish.

1227
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:42,770
Souls meet,
they together forever flourish.

1228
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,310
Kaabir?

1229
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:50,770
Why are you here?

1230
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:53,230
Saiba forgot why she is here.

1231
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,060
Jilaan shall no longer
even look at our Ghat.

1232
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,980
Didn't you get the message?
- I got the message.

1233
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:03,060
But I didn't get Saiba.

1234
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:09,520
I'll take Saiba with me…

1235
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:11,150
After killing Jilaan.

1236
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,310
Nothing can be done now, Kaabir.

1237
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,310
I belong to him.

1238
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,100
But Saiba belongs to me.

1239
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:33,150
Maybe in another life.
Maybe this was destiny.

1240
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:35,940
Father has asked
me to get Jilaan's head.

1241
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:44,150
Then take mine along as well.

1242
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:58,310
My heart shall always
beat with Saiba's name.

1243
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:03,440
Have you ever heard your
name in that Muraaki's heart?

1244
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:06,400
Muraakis only have courage,
they don't have a heart.

1245
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:09,940
Jilaan is a Muraaki.

1246
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:13,310
He has as many wives
as the wars he has won.

1247
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,150
He must have done
this hundreds of times.

1248
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:16,900
He must be having
hundred more Saibas.

1249
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:20,190
I have only one.
- Jilaan loves only me.

1250
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:35,060
Is Saiba happy?

1251
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,690
Then I shall learn to live.

1252
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,400
Only Paathar will feel lonely.

1253
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,230
Don't forget me, Saiba.

1254
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,980
[Prayer]

1255
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:30,190
Jilaan-Saiba. Celestial lovers.

1256
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:35,060
Muraaki! Muraaki!

1257
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:52,690
I am no ordinary thing.

1258
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,230
Then what are you?

1259
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:05,150
I am something you should forever
and forever, keep with you.

1260
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:11,480
Isn't one forever enough?

1261
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,400
No.

1262
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:18,520
For you it will be
another victory tomorrow.

1263
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:27,600
You are my victory.

1264
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:32,940
Then leave the rest
of the world for me.

1265
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:44,770
What, Muraaki?
Can you only fight?

1266
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:50,020
Only the one
who can fight can love.

1267
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:53,150
Can fight for love.

1268
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:55,270
Can die for love.

1269
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:09,100
What is going to happen tonight?

1270
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:11,400
Is the sky going crazy?

1271
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,060
Don't question nature.

1272
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:17,560
This is happening..

1273
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:21,060
..because you are about to
belong to me forever and forever.

1274
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:26,690
Such a ferocious storm happens
only once in a thousand years.

1275
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:32,350
There will be only one Saiba
and Jilaan in a thousand years.

1276
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:15,150
The moon shall yield a sword.

1277
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:18,270
You are the moon and
I am a dark night.

1278
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:39,600
How did I get so attached to you?

1279
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:42,400
Trust your heart.

1280
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:46,480
Does your heart beat to my name?

1281
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,730
How would it?

1282
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,520
Muraakis don't possess a heart.

1283
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,440
Saiba belongs to me.

1284
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,520
And she shall always belong to me.

1285
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,440
I had said so.

1286
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,730
You shall die in Paathar's waters.

1287
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:34,900
So Muraakis don't possess a heart?

1288
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:37,440
We gave you a heart
and then stabbed it.

1289
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:42,270
We killed you with deceit.

1290
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,270
Saiba did.

1291
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:57,600
No trust, no love.

1292
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:09,850
Don't commit this sin, Kaabir.

1293
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:10,900
Don't.

1294
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,520
It is no sin to kill for love.

1295
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:18,060
Die for love,
don't kill for love, Kaabir.

1296
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:21,900
This full moon,
this water, the shadows...

1297
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:26,850
Jilaan, Saiba, such love...
happens once in a thousand years.

1298
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:29,690
Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.

1299
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,270
Here.. I die for you.

1300
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:46,060
No!

1301
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,690
'A stormy sky...'

1302
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:01,730
'A ferocious moon...'

1303
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,440
'Bodies meet, bodies perish.'

1304
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,190
'Souls meet,
they together forever flourish.'

1305
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:24,520
Saiba was never yours
and shall never be.

1306
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,850
Nature shall repeat this story.

1307
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:34,400
Today love has bled into water.

1308
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,150
Then there's no lover greater than me.

1309
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:54,350
'If they do not make it
through the ocean of fire...'

1310
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,520
'One last breath
would forever remain a desire.'

1311
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,190
'Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.'

1312
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:21,560
'No trust, no love.'

1313
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:27,270
'Here... I die for you.'

1314
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:34,940
'Souls meet,
they together forever flourish.'

1315
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:40,690
Karma. Things come back to you.

1316
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:43,850
They repeat.

1317
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:46,850
What had happened will repeat.

1318
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:51,020
Only you can change it, Saira.

1319
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:58,850
You were mine and
shall always remain mine.

1320
01:54:59,770 --> 01:55:00,770
Kaabir.

1321
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:08,560
So you know...?

1322
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:29,940
So now what?

1323
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:38,100
The same old story, this time
I am the king and you are the queen.

1324
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,730
Now I need to decide..

1325
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,060
..whether I should
kill him to get you...

1326
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:54,850
Or shall I get you and then kill him.

1327
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:59,190
He will die and you will belong to me.

1328
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:01,600
It was me who made the mistake.

1329
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:03,100
Spare his life.

1330
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:05,480
So much concern for him?

1331
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:09,770
I have come back only for you.

1332
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:13,060
There is a difference.
- What's the difference?

1333
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:16,980
You took a life and he gave his life
to come back.

1334
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:19,980
You have to also kill to get love.

1335
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:21,270
I want to change this story.

1336
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,900
You want to change it?
How will you change it?

1337
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:24,230
I don't want anyone's
blood on my conscience.

1338
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,400
Blood... Why blood?

1339
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:31,230
He can fall from a tall building.

1340
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:33,520
Or..

1341
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:40,060
..he could get electrocuted,
while making toast.

1342
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:44,900
I promise you,
I'll give you a right to choose.

1343
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:51,020
And what if you can have me?

1344
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:57,980
Then you won't kill him, right? Yeah?

1345
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,810
The one who had disarmed
him is now his armor.

1346
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:09,190
This time he won't die because of me.

1347
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,650
Okay, done!

1348
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:15,980
We get engaged in three days.

1349
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:17,900
Then...

1350
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:22,900
You will fall in love eventually.

1351
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:26,730
Anyway...

1352
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:31,020
The only one...

1353
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:39,230
I am the only one you can love.

1354
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:51,440
Not even a kiss for your fiancé?

1355
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,230
This is quite a strange beginning.

1356
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,600
Hi, good evening.
Glad you could make it.

1357
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:18,230
Hi, welcome.

1358
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:21,600
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1359
01:58:21,850 --> 01:58:22,980
Everyone...

1360
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:25,100
The future Mrs. Merchant.

1361
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,810
Bodies meet, bodies perish.

1362
01:58:38,770 --> 01:58:41,600
Souls meet,
they together forever flourish.

1363
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:50,150
"The heart has confessed to you..."

1364
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:54,850
"Making the eyes speak..."

1365
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:59,100
"A promise of faithfulness was made."

1366
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:06,900
"I have bonded you to myself."

1367
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:11,060
"My prayers got answered."

1368
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:15,060
"My dreams got fulfilled."

1369
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:25,100
"You now dwell in my heart..."

1370
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:34,690
"The eyes express the said,
and the unsaid."

1371
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:39,020
"There is some connection with you."

1372
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:43,190
"There is some connection with you."

1373
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:47,440
"Why it is,
and how it is, you tell me."

1374
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:51,560
"There is some connection with you."

1375
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:23,850
What happened?

1376
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:35,190
"It obliged me while going..."

1377
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:42,980
"A passing moment
fulfilled my wishes..."

1378
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:51,480
"I got to see you.
I got shinning star..."

1379
02:00:51,650 --> 02:00:59,770
"Like I got a sign from fate."

1380
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:08,230
"It looks like the world
has blossomed with your favor."

1381
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:17,600
"I got your sign in my dreams..."

1382
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:22,100
"There is some connection with you."

1383
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:26,230
"There is some connection with you."

1384
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:30,560
"Why it is,
and how it is, you tell me."

1385
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:34,690
"There is some connection with you."

1386
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:44,900
Congratulations, my love.

1387
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:53,730
Remove it, remove it.

1388
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:57,730
Remove it! Look at the size
of the diamond he's holding.

1389
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:02,850
This same old scene
takes place in every story.

1390
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:08,150
One dude makes a last minute entry and
the engagement goes for a six...

1391
02:02:12,150 --> 02:02:14,100
You and your intense look.

1392
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:17,150
Don't worry.
This won't happen to you.

1393
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:18,230
Do you know why?

1394
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:24,230
Because women don't fall for the man,
but the mansion.

1395
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,190
Right?

1396
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,600
You ditcher...

1397
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:44,980
I left for a week and you left me.

1398
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:49,850
Only if you had been
a little more crazy...

1399
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:52,810
...you would never have left me.

1400
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,600
You remember what I had told you?

1401
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:32,770
You can give her a ring,
but I'll be the one taking her home.

1402
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:34,060
Remember that.

1403
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:35,350
Stay for dinner.

1404
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:50,850
I was only playing with destiny.

1405
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:59,600
Anyway, he will die as destined.

1406
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,440
Go find him.

1407
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:11,560
What's the angle?

1408
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:13,100
Why have you come here?

1409
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:14,980
Why did you go there?

1410
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,900
Don't you get a newspaper at home?

1411
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:20,810
You are changing the topic again.

1412
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:22,440
You can try. You cannot avoid me.

1413
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,190
Why did you go there?
- Shiv! What's wrong…

1414
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:25,400
What's wrong with you?

1415
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:26,480
What's wrong with me?

1416
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,560
What's wrong with you?

1417
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:29,770
I am getting married.

1418
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:31,020
Okay?

1419
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:35,400
And he's just the type of guy I want.

1420
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:38,400
Intense, charming..

1421
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,190
Silent.

1422
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:42,350
Silent in bed as well?

1423
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:44,100
Stop your nonsense and leave!

1424
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:46,690
I am the one talking nonsense?
I am the one talking nonsense?

1425
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:49,400
He's just your type?
He's charming?

1426
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:51,100
What were you doing with me?

1427
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,650
What were you doing with me?

1428
02:04:53,770 --> 02:04:56,150
Tell me, what were you
doing with me then!

1429
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:02,100
Tell me something.

1430
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:03,810
Listen… please.
I won't do anything.

1431
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:04,900
Listen to me.

1432
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:08,650
I understand that
economics is important.

1433
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:10,400
I am a banker, I understand.

1434
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:13,730
But doesn't chemistry mean anything?

1435
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:17,560
Doesn't chemistry mean anything?

1436
02:05:26,190 --> 02:05:28,350
Try to understand, please.

1437
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:32,770
Relax!
- I'll kill her.

1438
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,020
Move... Move...

1439
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:38,060
Stay there.
I swear I'm going to kill her.

1440
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,060
What have you done, Shiv?

1441
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:50,190
He will kill you.

1442
02:06:29,190 --> 02:06:32,480
Wait, did you kidnap
me or did I kidnap you?

1443
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:33,980
I don't understand.

1444
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,940
Oh my!
- What happened?

1445
02:06:58,270 --> 02:06:59,310
Uncle and auntie.

1446
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:01,520
What?
- Hello, uncle.

1447
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:03,980
I seek your blessings, aunty.
How are you doing?

1448
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:06,350
Did you see what she was about to do?

1449
02:07:06,730 --> 02:07:09,020
Ultimately, I had to explain
it to her that she cannot marry him.

1450
02:07:09,190 --> 02:07:12,350
And auntie,
after using my body, how could she…

1451
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,520
Don't be stupid, Shiv.

1452
02:07:14,150 --> 02:07:15,060
What are you doing?

1453
02:07:15,190 --> 02:07:16,020
What are you doing?

1454
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:17,270
Just a second, aunty.

1455
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:20,690
You didn't jump into the
pool but you jumped into the sea!

1456
02:07:20,770 --> 02:07:22,060
You know you are the first heroine..

1457
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:23,770
..to go and plank herself
in the villain's den?

1458
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:25,310
And I am looking for
you like a hero turned monkey…

1459
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:27,560
And that b**tard is coming after
my tail with a match in his hand.

1460
02:07:27,730 --> 02:07:28,270
Shiv…

1461
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:31,850
Let's go.

1462
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:41,270
Shiv, we have met before.

1463
02:07:42,940 --> 02:07:43,810
In our past life.

1464
02:07:44,690 --> 02:07:45,480
What?

1465
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:49,600
I was a princess
and you were a warrior.

1466
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:50,940
And we were in love.

1467
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:54,190
What…what…what…

1468
02:07:54,230 --> 02:07:56,230
Zak killed you to make me his.

1469
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:58,100
And the same thing
is going to repeat again.

1470
02:07:58,730 --> 02:08:00,190
Shiv, are you getting me?

1471
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:03,770
You lost your life because of me.

1472
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:07,020
Shiv, we can't be together anymore.

1473
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:09,730
Just…just…just a second.

1474
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:11,940
One second.
Just give me a second, okay?

1475
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:21,650
Listen to me.
- Just a second, okay?

1476
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:22,850
Very important.

1477
02:08:26,730 --> 02:08:29,400
You nitwit! Where is your Hidimba!

1478
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:30,810
That bloody old hag!

1479
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:32,560
You ask why am I cussing?

1480
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,560
She has made my life hell.

1481
02:08:34,690 --> 02:08:35,730
My girlfriend has lost it.
- Shiv!

1482
02:08:35,850 --> 02:08:37,850
Past life, king and queen
and what not she is talking about.

1483
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,690
I'll stab her to death if I see her.

1484
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:40,770
Let her know.

1485
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:42,770
What? I am on the other
side of the island. Wait a second.

1486
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:43,600
Hey!

1487
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:45,940
What's your problem?
- You think I have lost it?

1488
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:47,770
Think about it.

1489
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:50,060
Who are you?
- What do you mean?

1490
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:52,230
I mean why is Zak coming
after a boring banker?

1491
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:54,230
Hold on a second!
Who's boring?

1492
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:55,440
I'm a crowd puller, okay?

1493
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:57,520
Everybody knows that. It's nothing new.
- Shiv, this is not funny!

1494
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,310
What is not funny?
I'm not being funny!

1495
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:00,770
What are you saying?

1496
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:03,310
All of this is connected.

1497
02:09:03,730 --> 02:09:04,560
Okay?

1498
02:09:04,770 --> 02:09:06,520
In fact, even the comet…

1499
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,560
All of this has happened before, Shiv.
You have to believe this.

1500
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:12,190
I have to believe this!

1501
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:14,770
What…what…what are you saying, baby?

1502
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:17,690
You are an educated, English speaking,
modern girl who lives in Europe.

1503
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:19,020
You make chocolates!

1504
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:20,770
Why are you saying
such strange things?

1505
02:09:51,020 --> 02:09:53,100
What do I do, I don't have any proof.

1506
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:58,310
Hey baby, what are you doing?
- Just a second!

1507
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:00,520
Baby, you cannot use
sex to make me believe.

1508
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:01,980
I'm reminding you of your birthmark.

1509
02:10:02,190 --> 02:10:03,400
Just think, why do you have it?

1510
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:04,900
This is where Zak had attacked you.

1511
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:06,730
I have seen it, Shiv.

1512
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:11,850
What happened?

1513
02:10:14,690 --> 02:10:17,940
I am remembering a few things.
Just a second.

1514
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:23,270
It's a classic 70mm
3D Jodha Akbar scenario!

1515
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:24,480
Oh God!

1516
02:10:24,690 --> 02:10:26,850
I look so hot in that costume.

1517
02:10:27,230 --> 02:10:29,440
And Zak was getting beaten
up back then as well. Take a look.

1518
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,810
He looked like a joker
back then too.

1519
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:33,770
And you were so sexy back then too!

1520
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:34,770
Press it again. Press it again.

1521
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:36,520
Go to hell if you
don't want to believe it.

1522
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,900
Baby… slave…
Massage my feet before you leave.

1523
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:40,350
Get lost!
- Farewell my subjects!

1524
02:10:54,190 --> 02:10:55,100
Wow!

1525
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:56,230
Helicopter!

1526
02:10:58,900 --> 02:10:59,730
Who am I?

1527
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:00,900
Osama?

1528
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:02,940
Shiv…
- Yes.

1529
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:04,230
Don't move.
- What happened?

1530
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:05,940
There's a spider on you.

1531
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:07,690
What are you doing!

1532
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:09,480
Where did it go?

1533
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:10,810
I feel ashamed.
- Why?

1534
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:12,900
Back in that life,
you had killed a tiger.

1535
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:14,190
That too without a weapon.

1536
02:11:14,270 --> 02:11:16,100
Baby, in this life,
I am the tiger. Got it?

1537
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:18,190
I'll bite if someone
tries to touch me.

1538
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:19,560
Tiger?
- Yes.

1539
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:04,400
There you go.
- Thanks.

1540
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:05,520
Let's go.

1541
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:08,770
What? Everything's set, right?

1542
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:10,900
Yes, everything is set.

1543
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:13,730
I'll take a plane and
go straight to Budapest.

1544
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:17,190
From there I'll go to the embassy
and then I'll come to get you.

1545
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:19,730
Otherwise,
you'll get stuck in the water.

1546
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:22,900
And no one has seen my face
so there is nothing to worry about.

1547
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:24,020
Everything will be…

1548
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,560
You are scared.
- Very scared.

1549
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:28,900
Scoundrel… I too am scared.

1550
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,310
You look after yourself in the boat.
- I will.

1551
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:34,190
We will take Lord's name.
everything will be fine.

1552
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,440
Shiv…
- What?

1553
02:12:36,270 --> 02:12:37,270
She is You.

1554
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,270
One should be ready
to face danger for her.

1555
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,900
You take care of yourself, got it?

1556
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:44,520
You are my life.

1557
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:46,850
Let's go?

1558
02:12:47,190 --> 02:12:48,190
Yeah?
- Yes. Let's go.

1559
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:12,350
You really don't believe
that we have met before, right?

1560
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:20,980
Not at all.

1561
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:32,650
But this bloody thing…
believes in everything you say.

1562
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:39,690
This understands that just to save my
life you agreed to marry a joker.

1563
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:43,810
I don't know about your past life.

1564
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:47,190
But in this life...

1565
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:53,650
I love you so much…

1566
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:58,440
…that I can handle
ten such villains for you.

1567
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:21,810
Look! Look! Look!

1568
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:25,270
There's another one!

1569
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:29,600
Lovejoy's love rain.

1570
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:36,690
What happened?

1571
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:38,900
Full moon?

1572
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:40,900
What…?

1573
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:42,730
Let's go.
- Where?

1574
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,440
Hurry up!

1575
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:46,100
Where are you taking me?

1576
02:15:18,190 --> 02:15:22,150
"A girl completely drenched."

1577
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:25,980
"Sleepless in a sleepy night."

1578
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:30,270
"She met a stranger."

1579
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:34,560
"I am the one in the past.
I am the one in the present."

1580
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:36,810
"Tell me…"

1581
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:39,980
"This is a fact!"

1582
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:46,810
Good evening.

1583
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:05,690
If your adventure trip is over,
shall we leave?

1584
02:16:07,690 --> 02:16:08,480
Saira!

1585
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:15,560
You have five minutes.

1586
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:23,520
Leave before this cigarette gets over.

1587
02:16:29,730 --> 02:16:31,310
I cannot leave.

1588
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:35,400
What story will I tell our kids?

1589
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:37,940
That papa got scared so
he ran away?

1590
02:16:46,310 --> 02:16:50,730
I forgot!
This story has an armour too!

1591
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,100
No.. No..

1592
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:08,980
No.. No..

1593
02:17:10,810 --> 02:17:12,100
No..!

1594
02:17:16,350 --> 02:17:19,350
Come on, leave this world.

1595
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:21,980
'A stormy sky...'

1596
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:23,770
'A ferocious moon...'

1597
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:25,560
It's time, Jilaan.

1598
02:17:28,190 --> 02:17:29,270
Stop it!

1599
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:31,400
No!

1600
02:17:37,850 --> 02:17:38,850
No!

1601
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:43,730
'If they do not make it
through the ocean of fire...'

1602
02:18:47,850 --> 02:18:50,770
'One last breath
would forever remain a desire.'

1603
02:19:16,770 --> 02:19:19,810
Bodies meet, bodies perish.

1604
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:23,650
Souls meet,
they together forever flourish.

1605
02:19:59,810 --> 02:20:02,060
Shiv! Shiv!

1606
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:07,230
Okay.

1607
02:20:11,690 --> 02:20:13,350
If you wouldn't have come for me…

1608
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:16,190
Then what stories would
you tell our kids?

1609
02:20:34,310 --> 02:20:38,900
Prayer.

1610
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:42,940
Listen carefully.

1611
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:50,440
Your mom might sometimes say that you
were Karan-Arjun in your past life.

1612
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:52,440
Don't believe her.

1613
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:56,310
Your mom is a little crazy.
But we all love her.

1614
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:57,270
Right?

1615
02:20:57,810 --> 02:20:58,770
Shiv.
- Okay?

1616
02:20:58,850 --> 02:20:59,810
Yes, baby!

1617
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:03,190
Don't believe her.
Let's go.

1618
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:25,770
"No, no, no, no."

1619
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:29,690
"No, no, no, no."

1620
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:41,060
"Separating the world from myself…"

1621
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:43,230
"I'll hug you and keep
you with me forever."

1622
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:47,900
"I wanna say to you, that I
want to live with you, oh beautiful."

1623
02:21:57,270 --> 02:21:59,440
"Separating the world from myself…"

1624
02:21:59,560 --> 02:22:01,770
"I'll hug you and keep
you with me forever."

1625
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:06,270
"I wanna say to you, that I
want to live with you, oh beautiful."

1626
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:08,690
"I did the whole love thing."

1627
02:22:08,850 --> 02:22:11,060
"I fell head over
heels in love with you."

1628
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:15,060
"I wanna say to you, that I
want to live with you, oh beautiful."

1629
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:17,560
"Because…"
"I'm your boyfriend…"

1630
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:19,440
"I'm your boyfriend…"

1631
02:22:20,310 --> 02:22:22,520
"I'm your boyfriend,
you're my girlfriend…"

1632
02:22:22,690 --> 02:22:24,900
"But she tells me, no, no, no, no."

1633
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:27,190
"I'm your boyfriend,
you're my girlfriend…"

1634
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:29,440
"But she tells me, no, no, no, no."

1635
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:31,810
"Wait up, at least hear me out…"

1636
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:34,190
"But she tells me, no, no, no, no."

1637
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:36,350
"I'm your boyfriend,
you're my girlfriend…"

1638
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:38,690
"And but tells me, no, no, no, no."

1639
02:22:38,810 --> 02:22:41,100
"Wait up, at least hear me out…"

1640
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:43,230
"And but tells me, no, no, no, no."

1641
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:48,350
"No, no, no, no."

1642
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:53,060
"No, no, no, no."

1643
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:06,310
"Blue eyes enhanced with
Delhi's kohl invites me."

1644
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:08,770
"How do I come close to you?
How do I hug you?"

1645
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,810
"This thought excites me."

1646
02:23:15,190 --> 02:23:17,940
"Listen,
I know you, I know your habits."

1647
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:20,190
"You fall for every girl."

1648
02:23:20,270 --> 02:23:22,480
"I don't trust you, I don't love you."

1649
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:24,730
"Why do you keep following me?"

1650
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:27,190
"You'll leave me after bothering me."

1651
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:29,400
"After you've finished lying to me."

1652
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:33,520
"I wanna say to you, that I don't
want to live with you, oh beautiful."

1653
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,270
"Because…"
"I'm your boyfriend…"

1654
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:38,020
"I'm your boyfriend…"

1655
02:23:38,850 --> 02:23:41,020
"I'm your boyfriend,
you're my girlfriend…"

1656
02:23:41,150 --> 02:23:43,270
"But she tells me, no, no, no, no."

1657
02:23:43,350 --> 02:23:45,560
"Hey, you're my boyfriend,
I'm your girlfriend…"

1658
02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:47,810
"And I now won't tell you,
no, no, no, no."

1659
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:50,190
"Wait up, at least hear me out…"

1660
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:52,900
"And I now won't tell you,
no, no, no, no."

1661
02:23:53,810 --> 02:23:55,350
"No, no, no, no."

1662
02:23:56,190 --> 02:23:57,650
"No, no, no, no."

1663
02:24:00,770 --> 02:24:02,270
"No, no, no, no."
