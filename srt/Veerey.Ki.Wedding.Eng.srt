1
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,992
(Chants)

2
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,595
Move..

3
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:01,875
Move!

4
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,196
Stop!

5
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:07,781
'That's Mr. Sharma.'

6
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:08,593
This wedding cannot take place.

7
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,907
'He too is one of
the fathers in Delhi..'

8
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:15,242
'..whose daughter's
heart beat for Veer.'

9
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:20,547
'Like others, Mr. Sharma too is eagerly
waiting for Veer to get married.'

10
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,383
'So that,
he too can find some peace of mind.'

11
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:23,984
What happened?

12
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,148
Channi eloped with Veerey.

13
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,461
Damn!

14
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,570
You are in your bed..

15
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,318
And not at a wedding hall.

16
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,872
Channi is making parathas
(flatbread) in the kitchen.

17
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:33,497
Really?

18
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,029
- Tell me something?
- Yeah?

19
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,685
Why are you so worried about Veerey?

20
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:39,693
Why do you keep cursing him?

21
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,318
He is such a nice boy.

22
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,945
He is a gem of a person, this Veer.

23
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,593
(Traffic)

24
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:52,427
'Prabhu Arora.'

25
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:53,834
'A businessman.'

26
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:58,827
'He has more money than he can count.'

27
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:04,724
'But he is such a miser that
even his money yearns to be spent.'

28
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,545
I have already added sugar.
You don't need to add more.

29
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,654
- And I have made it so you don't have to..
- Listen..

30
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,359
You don't need to add sugar
when you make it, darling.

31
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,185
Enough of romance.

32
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:15,966
Your blood sugar level is high.

33
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,920
- Come on, let's eat breakfast.
- Coming.

34
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,060
- Tolaram..
- Yes, ma'am?

35
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:21,411
- Is the tea ready?
- Yes.

36
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:22,156
Did you add sugar?

37
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:24,375
Yes.. no.
No, I didn't.

38
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,857
'He has just one problem, his son..'

39
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:27,804
'Veer.'

40
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,239
'He keeps giving away
millions as charity..'

41
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:34,744
'And keeps giving his
father shocks in small doses.'

42
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:38,521
Listen, Veerey shenanigans
tend to hurt in such a way..

43
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,545
..that you cannot
even complain about them.

44
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,709
What happened?

45
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:44,547
Tell me..

46
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:45,779
What did he do?

47
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:48,998
He spent 270,000 on two dentures.

48
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:52,235
- 270,000?
- Yes.

49
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:53,506
- On two dentures?
- Yes.

50
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,575
Did he break someone jaw?

51
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:56,974
Tell me.

52
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,029
What are you doing?

53
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,214
I asked you something.

54
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,168
It's not so.

55
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:03,950
Then?

56
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,060
There's Trilok Nagar
behind the Hanuman, right?

57
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:07,030
Hmm.

58
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:08,763
There is a juice stall over there, right?

59
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:09,338
Hmm.

60
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:13,294
That uncle with moustaches
and his short wife..

61
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,013
The one who speaks like a parrot.

62
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,693
She met Veerey one day.

63
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:17,654
She was missing a few teeth.

64
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,091
She told him:

65
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,459
"Son, I wish to eat walnuts."

66
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,849
So, your generous soon
took her to City Hospital.

67
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,756
Do you know what she told him?

68
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,474
"We want imported teeth."

69
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,247
So, he got her imported teeth.

70
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,318
135,000 for one.
270,000 for two.

71
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,183
He did a good deed.

72
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,482
Even if only for a few days,
she will at least food that she likes.

73
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,138
Right?

74
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,626
Darling, what will she eat?

75
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:44,731
She has got a new pair
of teeth worth 270,000.

76
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:45,966
Now she calls him every day..

77
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,638
"Send over some walnuts.
I wish to eat walnuts."

78
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,982
Now they want him to arrange
for walnuts as well. Amazing.

79
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,256
Listen..

80
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:53,326
Sorry, my phone.

81
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,138
If you come across any
of his shenanigans, do inform me..

82
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,427
I cannot digest food
until I hear about one.

83
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:03,162
No matter what you say,
my Veerey is the heart of Delhi.

84
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,216
'You guessed it right. That's
the guy we are talking about, Veer.'

85
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:07,943
'Problem?
What problem?'

86
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,460
'That's the problem..
He doesn't have any problem.'

87
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:10,961
(Cell Phone Ringing)

88
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:13,443
'So, he keeps solve
problems of the world.'

89
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:14,896
'What?'

90
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,451
'You just saw his mobile phone.
Once you have a look at him..'

91
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,162
Veerey, I've got a tip.

92
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,631
- A few are planning to rob an ATM van.
- When?

93
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:22,618
11:30 am.

94
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,355
Four men.

95
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,107
They will pass through CP.

96
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:24,772
'Awesome.'

97
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:27,293
(Tyres screeching)

98
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,330
Step on it!

99
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:30,371
Okay.

100
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:31,213
Faster!

101
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:32,555
Do you want me to make it fly?

102
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:35,019
(Motorcycle purring)

103
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,312
Drive faster!

104
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:38,778
Why don't you drive instead?

105
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:10,208
(Glass Breaks sound)
Oh no!

106
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:21,732
(Traffic)

107
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,231
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

108
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:36,278
(Fighting sounds)

109
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,657
Get down quickly.

110
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:26,415
Hurry up. Someone will show up.

111
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:27,520
Take this too.

112
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:28,979
We need to take all the money.

113
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,061
- Open the bag wide.
- Yes. Take some more.

114
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:34,714
Give it here.

115
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,692
First, learn how to hold it.

116
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,746
Please forgive us.

117
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,613
Sorry. I am a mistake, sir.

118
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:43,848
Please forgive me, sir.

119
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,707
My sister is getting married.
I need 100,000, sir.

120
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,535
That's why I agreed
to come with them, sir.

121
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,181
Please save me, sir.
Otherwise, my family will get ruined.

122
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,050
Please, sir.

123
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,504
Please forgive me, sir.

124
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:55,199
I need 50,000, sir.

125
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,722
My mother is in the hospital, sir.

126
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,199
Please forgive me, sir.
I need 50,000.

127
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,121
I need to gift my wife a gold necklace.

128
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,301
Your wife?

129
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,068
She refuses to give me food.

130
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,199
What's your wife's name?

131
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,019
Diya.

132
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,291
- Huh?
- Diya!

133
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,061
Diya!

134
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,684
Wants to gift a necklace!

135
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,668
- Give me just some, sir.
- Get lost!

136
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,436
Give me just some, sir. I am hungry, sir.
(Gun Locking Sound)

137
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,300
- Give me just some.
- Get lost!

138
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,363
She won't give me any food today either!

139
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,270
He ran away, leaving us alone.

140
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:24,952
First of all, put all the money back.

141
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,817
If I catch you doing this again..

142
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:29,972
Then your bones will
be found in this trunk.

143
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:31,444
Got it?

144
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,290
Yes.

145
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,762
You can take 100,000 out of it.

146
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:37,918
And you too take 50,000.

147
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:38,902
How much did you need? 50,000?

148
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:39,606
50,000 right?

149
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:40,567
Take 50,000 and leave.

150
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,431
Never do such a thing again.

151
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,851
(Police Siren Sound) Got it?
Pick them up.

152
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,910
Count it!

153
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,296
(Car Stopped Sound)
Count!

154
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,501
Count yours.

155
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:53,171
(Door closed)
Four, five..

156
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:54,942
- Jai Hind, sir!
- Jai Hind.

157
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:57,696
Where's Veer?

158
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,642
Veer handed this over to us and left.

159
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:01,365
- Does it contain all the money?
- No, sir.

160
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:02,848
150,000 are missing.

161
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,254
He made government
do a charity of 150,000.

162
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:09,605
Veerey, you will never change.

163
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:12,292
- You first.
- What about you?

164
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,441
Papa, please, we want ice cream.

165
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:15,547
Lajwanti..

166
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:18,100
Didn't I promise you that
I'd give you a tour of Delhi?

167
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:19,191
See, I fulfilled my promise.

168
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,230
Rubbish, what tour did you take me?

169
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,527
It's so hot in here.

170
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,996
And you didn't even
give me anything to eat.

171
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,207
Tell me, what would you like to eat?
I will get it right away.

172
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,859
I want to eat ice cream.

173
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,808
- The big one.
- Ice cream?

174
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,038
The big one?

175
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:34,504
Oh shit.

176
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,153
I don't have any money left.

177
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:01,797
Here, have some rocket ice cream.

178
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:02,734
I have others too.

179
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,366
- Here's 4,000.
- 4,000!

180
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:06,152
- Get me some more.
- I'll get them.

181
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:06,896
Geet!

182
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,210
Mr. Veer Arora, you just wait there!

183
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:10,938
I'll teach you a lesson today.

184
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,436
What do you think of yourself?

185
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,975
Will I keep waiting for you all my life?

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,720
- Sorry, Geet.
- Don't I have anything else to do?

187
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:18,669
- I won't be late again.
- You don't respect me at all.

188
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:19,506
Lord Almighty!

189
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:21,538
When will you learn
to come on time, Veer?

190
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,303
Papa, please. Papa, please.

191
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:25,201
I am not going to be your wife.

192
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:27,922
Otherwise, I'll spend
my whole life waiting for you.

193
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,912
What do you think of yourself?
You've had it from me today!

194
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,077
Lord Hanuman, please save my honor.

195
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,829
Here, eat this!

196
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,319
(Bell Sound)
Got it!

197
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,161
Take this.

198
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,155
Didn't I tell you,
I am well respected over here?

199
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,276
Thank you, Lord Hanuman.

200
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:42,432
Yum!

201
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:48,939
You want to eat ice cream?

202
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,275
Here, have some more.

203
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,607
I'll teach you a lesson.

204
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,953
You idiot, donkey!

205
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:59,157
Veer Arora,
you will never stop being late, right?

206
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,688
I will have to keep
waiting for you all my life?

207
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,293
I have no intentions of being Mrs.
Veer Arora.

208
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:03,957
Got it?

209
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:08,552
(Whistles)

210
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:27,752
"Keep me in your heart
and not your mind."

211
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,549
"Don't keep me on the side or behind."

212
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:43,392
"Keep me in your heart
and not your mind."

213
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:47,150
"Don't keep me on the side or behind."

214
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:49,157
"Listen up, girl.."

215
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,137
"Listen up, girl.."

216
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:52,921
"I have a huge fan following."

217
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:56,906
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

218

"He is quite mind-blowing."

220
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,313
"He is quite mind-blowing."

221
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,171
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

222
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:16,326
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

223
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:35,076
"You can follow me on twitter
or stock me on Facebook."

224
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:38,889
"I am very famous,
a have millions of fans."

225
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,892
"Let me click a selfie
together and upload it."

226
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,724
"You too will get famous and renowned."

227
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,939
"I agree a little milky.."

228
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:52,405
"I agree a little
milky is your glowing."

229
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,169
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

230
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,790
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

231
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:19,205
"My love,
you can check the Whatsapp DP."

232
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:22,885
"You can ask your friend or trust me."

233
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,893
"Keep your threatening attitude away."

234
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:30,908
"Tag love a little,
and enjoy heavily bliss every day."

235
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,856
"Let the car.."

236
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:36,448
"Let the car go slowing."

237
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:40,315
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

238
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:44,143
"Don't ignore me,

"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

242
00:14:55,846 --> 00:15:00,285
"Don't ignore me,
I am quite mind-blowing."

243
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,725
(Machine sound)

244
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:07,776
Arora, I am fed up with Ghuggi.

245
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,791
What happened?
What did he do now?

246
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,729
- He rejected that girl as well.
- Really?

247
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,822
He says she doesn't have a good voice.

248
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,099
Arora..

249
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:24,186
He always does something as
soon as my blood pressure gets normal.

250
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:27,624
Brother, your son only does something..

251
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,647
My son Veer always
does something drastic.

252
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:30,352
Really?

253
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,019
I went to Kolkata a few days back.

254
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:33,889
Only for three days.

255
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:36,405
Veer looked after the whole factory.

256
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,460
My right-hand man, Shambhu.

257
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,574
He is fifty years old.

258
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:43,108
He fell in love with a girl
who applies henna in a parlor.

259
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:44,569
- You know what Veer did?
- What?

260
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,930
He got them both married.

261
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,428
- That's good.
- How is it good?

262
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,154
They got married three months back.

263
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,738
He is still on honeymoon.

264
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:52,745
Oh.

265
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,412
Brother, all my deliveries got delayed.

266
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:59,474
I have never said as many
lies as I have in these three months.

267
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,076
And all this is because of Veer.

268
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,076
And Veer is just a pupil.

269
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:03,719
Really?

270
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,454
- You know my elder brother, Nikku?
- Yes.

271
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,716
Nikku's son, Balli, he is his guru.

272
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:11,711
Okay.

273
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,984
If Veer is trouble, Balli is big trouble.

274
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,672
I'm warning you, keep your hands away.

275
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,086
You are a queen.

276
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,680
You aren't meant to martyr as a cop.

277
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:28,469
You are meant to keep
a king like me happy.

278
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,982
(Punch sound)

279
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,555
You..!

280
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:51,422
Your first crime,
interfering in police's investigation.

281
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:59,493
Your second crime,
touching a police officer's uniform.

282
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:03,844
Your third crime,
you touched a female police officer.

283
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,719
Under section 240..

284
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:09,547
324..

285
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:13,313
338..

286
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,000
You will all get arrested.

287
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,651
(Bird Chirping)

288
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,290
At least for 11 years.

289
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,993
Police has surrounded you from all sides.

290
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:29,594
(Indistinct)

291
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:31,493
Drop your weapons..

292
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,102
Right where you are standing.

293
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:36,555
Drop your weapons!

294
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,352
Idiots!

295
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:40,571
What are you doing?

296
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,461
Why should we believe you
that there are cops outside?

297
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,305
- Hey you, go and check.
- Okay, boss.

298
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:48,399
Why should he go out?

299
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,407
Are you scared of facing a bullet?

300
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,251
He is fooling us, boss.

301
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:55,258
- There are no cops outside.
- If they aren't here as yet..

302
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,180
..they will be here soon.

303
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:58,363
There they are.

304
00:17:58,567 --> 00:17:59,806
Police has started to come on time.

305
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,951
Get him! Get everyone!

306
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:04,227
Sir!

307
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,016
Listen up! Sir!
Actually..

308
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:12,711
I came here at the right time.

309
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,531
I was on a bike.

310
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,805
But my team got stuck in the traffic.

311
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:17,781
Hats off to you.

312
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:19,037
Thank you so much, sir.

313
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:20,381
Thank you.

314
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:23,369
I'm Balli.

315
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:26,002
I work here..

316
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,501
Your work was amazing.

317
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:30,504
What was so amazing?

318
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,406
It was straight out of the movie Deewar.

319
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:33,935
Shashi Kapoor had acted
it out in the movie.

320
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,977
I just tried to match up a little.

321
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:38,133
This is the style big people.

322
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,078
They don't want to take any credit.

323
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,532
But I have to say, we will meet again.

324
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:47,938
I am Rani Chaudhary.

325
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,322
Inspector Rani Chaudhary.

326
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,331
Golnakkar police station.

327
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:52,356
Thank you.

328
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,391
Cops shouldn't be thanking anyone.

329
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,582
It is their job to provide the service.

330
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,813
It is the public who should thank them.

331
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,882
Damn!

332
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,756
He ignored Rani Chaudhary!

333
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:10,186
(Traffic)

334
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:11,761
Sir, if I may..

335
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:15,486
I extinguish the lamps at dusk..

336
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,352
Extinguish them.

337
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:19,219
Someone's memory sparks
my heart bright enough.

338
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:21,523
Someone's memory sparks my heart..

339
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,195
Wonderful..

340
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,541
- Amazing.
- Thank you.

341
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:26,362
It touched my heart.

342
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:28,743
Enjoy your drink.

343
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,222
Drink.

344
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:33,297
It's freeof cost. Drink.

345
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,234
Sir, may I ask something?

346
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:41,105
Why do you always listen
to sad pain-filled poetries?

347
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,469
What happened?

348
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:47,735
My heart is full of pain, Mr. Ghumra.

349
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:49,820
(Instrumental Music)
Oh.

350
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,399
I met a girl.

351
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:00,305
I fell in love.

352
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:01,604
Great.

353
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:08,174
And I also go an opportunity
to take things forward.

354
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,395
You should try the
Balushahi (sweets), sister.

355
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:11,955
No, thank you.

356
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:15,575
Well, I try to avoid
sweets to maintain my figure.

357
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,754
- There..
- Okay.

358
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:19,187
Come on, why should anyone avoid sweets?

359
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,782
Take it, otherwise aunt..

360
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,867
Actually, after my parents passed away..

361
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,805
..aunt was the one who brought me up.

362
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:31,665
No one can be a better
aunt or a better mother than her.

363
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,211
And in near future, no one would
be a better mother-in-law than her.

364
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:38,665
- There, even uncle is here.
- Look, he too is here.

365
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,458
Wonderful.

366
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,498
This house seems quite lively today.

367
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:44,070
- He's..
- Hello.

368
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,281
- Hello.
- He's my uncle.

369
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,119
He has played a double role.

370
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,743
As my father and as my uncle.

371
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,189
- Hello.
- Hello.

372
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:52,664
Hello, uncle.

373
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:55,110
I had given my approval
right after I saw your picture.

374
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,508
Balli..

375
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:59,133
I hope you have told
Sughanda about Mallika.

376
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:00,219
You haven't told her?

377
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,435
I'd suggest that you should
tell her everything before marriage.

378
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,196
You will face trouble if things
come out in the open after marriage.

379
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:10,750
He was crazy about Mallika.

380
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:13,172
- Please have the Samosas.
- Please.

381
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:15,969
You don’t have to take this seriously.

382
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:17,074
He loves to joke.

383
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,860
You know the forest behind Barrakhamba?

384
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,930
- Stop him.
- He spent three nights with her there.

385
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,227
I told him to at least
change his underwear.

386
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,198
- What are you waiting for Sughanda?
- He is joking.

387
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,711
- Who is Mallika? Underwear.
- Please sit down.

388
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,172
Sister! Sister! Sister!

389
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,477
- Please listen to me.
- We have heard enough.

390
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:33,672
Please listen to me.

391
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:35,417
Sughanda!
Sughanda, listen to me!

392
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,977
I had just fallen in love..

393
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:41,718
And uncle's joke ruined it all.

394
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:43,827
(Cell Phone Ringing)

395
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:48,094
Sughanda, I have been trying
to call you from so long.

396
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,055
The Mallika they are talking
about is Mallika Sherawat.

397
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,219
I am her fan.

398
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,321
I have seen Murder 25 times.

399
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:56,461
I was with her in Barrakhamba's forest.

400
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:59,079
But that's because they were
using my cars for her movie's shooting.

401
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,711
Look, I am Anu and not Sughanda.

402
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:02,883
Sughanda's friend.

403
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,711
Sughanda's phone is with me.

404
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:06,732
Oh.
Hello, Anu.

405
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,165
Before the palace of
my love turns to dust..

406
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,891
..please help me talk to Sughanda.

407
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:17,790
By the way Mr. Balli..

408
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:20,102
Sughanda is taking her
third vow at the moment.

409
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,555
The palace of your love
has already turned to dust.

410
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:22,969
What?

411
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:26,726
Damn..

412
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:28,656
That..

413
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,805
Now the situation is such that..

414
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:34,906
I find peace not when
I try to heal the wound..

415
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,672
..but when I try to reopen it.

416
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:42,133
How about another one?

417
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:44,888
Hey!

418
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:45,702
(Tickles)

419
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:47,998
(Snoring)

420
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:49,890
Damn you!

421
00:22:52,853 --> 00:22:54,642
(Cell Phone Ringing)

422
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,069
Hello?

423
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,858
Well done, uncle.

424
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:14,452
You are having a good night's
sleep after ruining my life?

425
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,023
Leaving this 35-year-old
unmarried man to wander..

426
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:23,375
..in the desert of loneliness,
you lie there hugging your wife?

427
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,480
Have some shame.

428
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:27,726
You will get cursed.

429
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:34,039
You will not get married
for the next seven lifetimes, uncle.

430
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:37,195
You can go to sleep now.

431
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,718
Who was it?

432
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:43,968
Who else could it be..

433
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:46,398
..providing peace to my
soul in the middle of night?

434
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:48,257
Balli.

435
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:50,664
He loves you a lot.

436
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,350
Mom, I would like to say a few words.

437
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:06,664
Go on, say it.

438
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,319
Thank you.

439
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:11,836
What does he want to say?

440
00:24:12,547 --> 00:24:14,172
He is just a kid.
Let him do it.

441
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:16,773
I would like to say something.

442
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:21,456
Today is a very big day for all of us..

443
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,531
..because today is
my grandfather's birthday.

444
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:27,578
I don’t know what a son
should do to honor his father.

445
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:32,211
But someone of my age should learn,
and I do just that.

446
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:37,711
I learn, when my father
does something for my grandfather.

447
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,913
When my father honors my grandfather..

448
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,711
When he does charity in his name..

449
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:45,398
It makes all of us very happy.

450
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,538
And today, to share that
happiness with all of you..

451
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:55,897
..dad has decided that all
of you get a month's salary as bonus!

452
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,140
(Claps)

453
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,198
There he goes again.

454
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,803
Hold on.

455
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:08,982
What are you doing?

456
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:10,231
A month's salary as bonus!

457
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:11,911
Did you ask uncle?

458
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,433
He was his father as well.

459
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,442
He was my grandfather too.
You didn’t ask me.

460
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,043
How can you just declare
a month's salary as bonus?

461
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,575
You won't get a month's salary as bonus.

462
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,319
You will 2 months' salary as bonus.

463
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,138
(Background Laughs)

464
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:29,900
Okay?

465
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,379
Amazing.

466
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,556
Thank you, Balli sir!

467
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,352
Mr. Balli..

468
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:39,903
There they do another charity.

469
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:41,558
Two months' salary as bonus!

470
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:45,007
You two have made me lose 7 million.

471
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,434
Dad, you are only thinking
about losing your 7 million.

472
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,613
Have you ever thought how much helpful..

473
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:55,223
- ..this 7 million will be for all
the workers? - Right?

474
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,207
It will help someone's sister
get admitted into a nice college.

475
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:59,191
Someone will be able to
get his mother's eye operated.

476
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,957
Someone will be able
to change his kneecaps.

477
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:04,418
Someone will be able
to go on a pilgrimage.

478
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:05,614
Someone will be able to go abroad.

479
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,168
If some poor fellow is if your age..

480
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,637
..then he will be able to enjoy
a five days package in Thailand.

481
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:11,662
- Right?
- Exactly.

482
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,301
You will get so many blessings, dad.

483
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,967
You will live a long life.

484
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:15,736
Oh God!

485
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:17,661
- Take this.
- And yes, we aren't doing this for you.

486
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:19,361
We are doing all this for aunt.

487
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:22,449
My aunt should dress up like
this for another 200-500 years.

488
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,887
- Right, aunt?
- Yes, sure.

489
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:28,933
That's why I want you two
to continue with your good work.

490
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,137
You should give out a
few months' salary as bonus..

491
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,871
..on every birth anniversary
of your grandfather.

492
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,340
I will handle him.
Right?

493
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:36,973
Oh..

494
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:46,514
Our love will grow
if we eat in one plate.

495
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,481
You can do all that after we get married.

496
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,270
You are so mean.

497
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,309
Okay listen..

498
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,088
Why don’t you think about our marriage?

499
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,816
I am thinking about that only.

500
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,690
First, let my grandson get married.

501
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:03,590
Otherwise, people will say..

502
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:08,246
"Look there,
the grandson of the marriageable age.."

503
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:09,830
"..and the grandfather got married."

504
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:10,744
Look!

505
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:12,690
Then why don’t you tell them?

506
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:14,121
What should I tell them, sweetheart?

507
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,549
That we want to get married.

508
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:16,758
Don’t worry.

509
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,401
If they are worried about their son..

510
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:20,546
..they will find a suitable
girl for him on their own.

511
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,535
Okay, I will call them right away.

512
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:24,873
(Cell Phone Ringing)

513
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,559
- Hello?
- Hello?

514
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:30,870
Father.

515
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,973
- I seek your blessings, father.
- God bless you.

516
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,231
Is everything fine?

517
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:35,979
Yes, with your blessings.

518
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,129
I wanted to talk to you about something.

519
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:39,463
Tell me, what is it?

520
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:42,408
Have you found any
suitable girl for Veer?

521
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,153
We are looking.

522
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,789
You should hurry up.

523
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,504
We are trying.

524
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:50,017
Okay, I will hang up now.

525
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,294
Happy now?

526
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:56,739
We still haven't found
any suitable girl forever.

527
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:02,443
Sir, how many times have I told you..

528
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:05,387
..that forget 70 acres,
I'm not even ready..

529
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:07,762
..to sell even a small piece of land.

530
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:10,310
'Gopichand Bhalla is renowned.'

531
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,192
'He owns a confectionery shop.'

532
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:13,986
'He is only worried
about high blood pressure.'

533
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,474
'And there's a name
which makes him go mad..'

534
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,239
Listen, what did you say your name was?

535
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,052
Prabhu Dayal, Prabhu.

536
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:24,705
Hang up!

537
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,544
Disconnect it.

538
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:26,859
Cut the phone!

539
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:28,020
'He disconnects it.'

540
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:29,605
'For now it's just the phone call..'

541
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:30,274
Sir, we have received a big order.

542
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,254
'You will see what happens later.'

543
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,838
Prabhu and Prabhu industries..

544
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:34,051
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

545
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:35,911
Why are you taking that name?

546
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:37,247
- Tell me the address.
- Sorry, sir.

547
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:39,559
You deliver the order at
the address and not on the name.

548
00:28:39,665 --> 00:28:40,426
- Sir..
- Go.

549
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:42,927
- Go and get the order ready. - You are
bound to get sweets at the sweetshop.

550
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,208
You can pack whatever you want.

551
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,181
Strange.

552
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:46,965
- Geet!
- Hello, papa.

553
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,864
- Hello.
- Here's your lunch.

554
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:49,380
What happened?

555
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:51,528
- Why are you out of breath?
- No, it's nothing.

556
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:52,492
Just..

557
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,750
Tell me.

558
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,016
Nothing. Just pack some
'Russmalia' (sweets) for me.

559
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:56,864
Okay.

560
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,528
- Nitesh.
- Yes, sir?

561
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:01,185
Pack that for Geet.

562
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:02,768
What is it called?
That..

563
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:04,685
What is it called?
What did you say?

564
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:06,903
Papa, Russmalia.

565
00:29:06,951 --> 00:29:08,301
- Yes, Malia.
- Okay.

566
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,309
Russmalia.

567
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,018
Pack it for her.

568
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:10,753
Are you fine?

569
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:11,685
Yes, I am fine.

570
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:12,606
I am good.

571
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:14,137
It's was just that..

572
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:14,865
(Murmering)

573
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:15,809
Go on.
Go.

574
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,802
(Cell Phone Ringing)

575
00:29:16,843 --> 00:29:17,872
- We are sitting inside.
- Okay.

576
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:18,689
Let's go.

577
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:19,576
- Let's go.
- Yes.

578
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:21,482
Yes, hello?
Yes, Juhi?

579
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:25,521
Listen, I have sent
holy offerings in lunch box.

580
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:26,234
Okay.

581
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,598
Give it to everyone in the shop.

582
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,386
Okay, listen..

583
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:30,172
What's playing in the background?

584
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:31,989
Prabhu's (Lord's) hymns.

585
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:36,433
Juhi, how many times have I told you..

586
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,539
..not to mention P-Ra-Bhu at one go?

587
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,978
I don’t know why this name
makes my blood pressure shoot up.

588
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:44,572
My sugar levels rise.

589
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:46,174
I start shivering.

590
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,517
I am not listening to it, Phoolan is.

591
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,642
I will switch it off.

592
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,868
Listen, if your blood pressure
is high then take a pill.

593
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:53,692
Okay.

594
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:58,450
I don’t know why everyone
is mentioning this name today?

595
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,231
You have Dahi Bhallas (snacks)?

596
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:02,354
Pack three pieces of them.

597
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:03,947
- Pack it.
- I'll pack them.

598
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:04,891
- Three will be enough.
- Okay.

599
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,322
- It will be ready in a few minutes.
- Okay.

600
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,003
Yes.

601
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:08,736
We should also pack some samosas, right?

602
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:09,205
Yes.

603
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:12,024
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.

604
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,831
Also pack a dozen samosas.

605
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,471
- Okay, madam. Right away.
- Let's go.

606
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:19,440
Geet, tell me something..

607
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:22,112
Why was uncle scolding
auntie for mentioning Prabhu..

608
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:24,589
- Don’t say Prabhu.
- Why?

609
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,315
Papa will scold us too if he hears it.

610
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,140
But why?

611
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:31,878
When mamma was in college,
she had a boyfriend.

612
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:34,403
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend!

613
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:36,065
His name was Prabhu.

614
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:36,757
(Bell Sound)

615
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,939
- Really?
- I swear.

616
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:40,619
Mom made a mistake.

617
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:43,432
She told papa everything
about him before they got married.

618
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:44,588
- She told him everything?
- Yes.

619
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:48,455
From the time papa learnt about him,
he started feeling insure.

620
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,416
We aren't even allowed to mention
Prabhu during prayers at home.

621
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:52,024
(Bell Sound)

622
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:53,158
- Really?
- Seriously.

623
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:56,026
I'm telling you, just mentioning
the name makes him furious.

624
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:57,408
- You are a donkey.
- What's happening out there?

625
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:57,901
Wait.

626
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:00,174
What is going on out here?
Do you come here to work or to fight?

627
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,175
No, sir! How dare you say that!

628
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,815
What's happening out there?

629
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,362
Have you two gone mad?

630
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,998
Why are you two fighting like animals?
Let go!

631
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:07,841
- Nitesh.
- Yes, sir?

632
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:12,080
Settle their accounts,
wish them goodbye and send them away.

633
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:12,581
Okay, sir.

634
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,868
You two know that
I prefer non-violence.

635
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,198
I don’t like one person hitting another.

636
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:20,641
Sir, he called me a donkey.

637
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,066
He said it and you believed
that you are a donkey?

638
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:27,456
And if you are a donkey then
you should sound like one too.

639
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,549
You don’t need to say anything.

640
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:32,370
Pack your stuff and leave.

641
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:33,799
Goodbye!

642
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,839
Come on, let me settle your accounts.
Let's go.

643
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,922
(Traffic)

644
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,729
Here son, have some butter.

645
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:47,229
You work really hard.

646
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:51,758
It is necessary to strength
your mind and body.

647
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:55,784
After all, you are carrying the burden
of whole Delhi on your shoulders.

648
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,791
- Right, Tolaram?
- Eat, son.

649
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,932
Yes, sir.

650
00:31:58,957 --> 00:31:59,757
You are absolutely right.

651
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:04,214
I too have started getting
a lot of respect because of him.

652
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:04,809
I swear.

653
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:08,666
I don’t even have to
pay parking charges anymore.

654
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:10,096
They say:

655
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:12,080
Mr. Tolaram, you may proceed.

656
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:13,214
Would you like to go home, Tolaram?

657
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,245
No, I will go to the kitchen.

658
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:17,315
And check on the lentils.

659
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,752
What are you doing, dad?

660
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,090
You should eat some butter.

661
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,849
You need it more.

662
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:23,515
You are carrying a heavier burden.

663
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:26,932
Along with the factory,
you look after Balli bro and me too.

664
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,586
Enjoy it, dad.
Get healthy.

665
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,391
Your uncle in Phagwada had called.

666
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,430
He isn't my uncle.
He is like a father to me.

667
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,206
Yes, him.

668
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:39,711
He was asking when we
were getting Veerey married.

669
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:42,706
He has nothing else to do.

670
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,563
He keeps getting people married.

671
00:32:44,903 --> 00:32:45,867
He didn’t say anything wrong.

672
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:47,539
It is not so easy to find suitable girls.

673
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,099
It takes time.

674
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,476
First ask Veer, is he interested
in getting married to a girl..

675
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:55,561
Or a boy.

676
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:57,792
What if this mother's
boy has changed tracks?

677
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:58,978
You keep quiet.

678
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,660
If you continue with this you won't let..

679
00:33:01,685 --> 00:33:02,724
..neither Balli nor Veer get married.

680
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,170
Oh.

681
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:07,508
You are talking about getting me married?

682
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:09,047
I didn’t know.

683
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,800
I am feeling so shy.

684
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:12,624
Let me do one thing..
Let me get out of here.

685
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,857
- I am getting late.
- Listen..

686
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,549
You are always getting late.

687
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,550
But what are you always late for?

688
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:21,407
You think I am a useless,
good for nothing, loafer, right?

689
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:23,664
Let me finalize the Japanese deal..

690
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,063
..I will make my brand
get global reorganization.

691
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:34,383
Get the car.

692
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:36,865
What, Mr. Ghumra?

693
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,288
No new poetry today?

694
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:41,233
- I am not high as yet.
- Not fair.

695
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,136
You will have to recite one for me.

696
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:44,211
Let the evening set in..

697
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,125
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

698
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:47,765
Don’t mind, but why are you laughing?

699
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:49,519
This photograph?

700
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:50,722
My bro.

701
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:51,602
His name is Balli.

702
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:52,571
He is a very simple man.

703
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:55,219
- Don’t mistake him for a funny one.
- No, it's not that.

704
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,446
In the collection of vintage
models of tragedy kings..

705
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,543
This new addition looks good.
Nice one.

706
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:05,336
Is she making fun of him or praising him?

707
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:06,521
It isn't clear to me.

708
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,132
They ask who Galib is..

709
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,413
Someone tell me what should I tell them.

710
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:10,143
Meaning?

711
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,804
You should get them together right away.

712
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:15,401
With great difficulty,
we have found him an admirer.

713
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,947
Don’t let her go.
Go.

714
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:19,797
Hello?
Yes, tell me.

715
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:21,115
Whom do you wish to talk to?

716
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,087
Mr. Balli?

717
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:24,321
Yes, I will give the call to him.
No problem.

718
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:25,336
That's great.

719
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:28,687
Nowadays a lot of people
seem to be interested in him.

720
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,172
Anyway, now what do I tell you about him?

721
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:33,338
He has the Shahrukh's
charm that he had in DDLJ.

722
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:35,886
Add Aamir's simplicity.

723
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:38,385
Also include,
the intensity Sunny Deol had in Ghayal.

724
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:41,539
And the light emotions
like Sanjay Dutt had in Saajan.

725
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,344
Cuteness of that Salman had in Santaan.

726
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:46,209
Mix all this and in the end add..

727
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:51,109
..Kamal Hassan's bad
luck that he had in Sadma.

728
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,164
That's it.

729
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:57,969
The personality that
you finally get is Mr. Balli.

730
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,780
I suggest you meet him.

731
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:03,560
You will know how nice
he is only after you meet him.

732
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:08,201
If you don’t like him,
I'll offer your lifetime serving free.

733
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:10,501
(Cell Phone Ringing)

734
00:35:12,638 --> 00:35:14,450
What kind of a phone do you guys give me!

735
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:15,496
I don’t know..

736
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:17,661
These Chinese dual sim
phones are very strange.

737
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,780
I don’t get it,
how does one receive call on one..

738
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:21,045
..when I am busy
in a call on the other.

739
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,482
It's okay.

740
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:25,024
Do one thing.. send the
documents of the car home.

741
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,990
- Okay?
- Sure.

742
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:39,120
How did I go?

743
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:42,537
The Chinese phone's
excuse was a little lame.

744
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,933
But the rest of the build up was fine.

745
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,105
Now it depends on Mr. Balli's faith..

746
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:49,003
..whether he turns this
into happiness or sadness.

747
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:51,907
And the way Pammi ran away from there..

748
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,564
- He ran?
- Yes.

749
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:55,008
That's what I have been
trying to tell Chandan.

750
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,094
He just doesn’t get it.
How can I run?

751
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:59,633
Pammi won't run even if there's
fire anywhere in the world.

752
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,258
And what if we are trapped in a fire?

753
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:03,164
Bros are treated differently.

754
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,796
Anyway, you aren't the ones
who will get trapped in a fire.

755
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,555
You are the ones who start the fire.

756
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:09,342
(Vehicle vrooming)
Look there.

757
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:10,391
Two more.

758
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,161
- That's 37. - 35. (Car Stopped Sound)

759
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:13,266
I too am keeping a score.
Still two short.

760
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:14,657
No, you made a mistake while counting.
(Car door close)

761
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:15,844
It's 37, I know.

762
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:17,852
You have no shame.

763
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:19,492
- You are staring at girls over here?
- No, no, no.

764
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:22,685
I got Samosas and Jalebis
from papa's shop..

765
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,094
..so that we can have lunch together.

766
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,439
But we have just..
No, you are a very busy man.

767
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:27,446
Go and stare at girls.
Shameless fellow.

768
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:28,430
- Don’t talk to me.
- Hey sweetheart!

769
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:30,816
- Hello!
- Take me along!

770
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:32,337
She feel shy.

771
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:35,156
Oh no.

772
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,986
Sorry! I made a mistake!

773
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,524
You are misbehaving with girls?

774
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:40,376
Let us go!

775
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,814
You have come here to eve tease?

776
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:45,765
Veer doesn’t come here to eve tease.
He comes here to save them.

777
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:49,150
The Romeo gang trouble them a lot.

778
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:52,857
Everything has calmed down from the time
Veer has started sitting over here.

779
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:57,460
When a few like them have a death wish,
they show up here.

780
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,439
Get lost.

781
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,549
(Motorcycle Engine starts)
If I saw you again. I'll beat you.

782
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,158
Don't show me your face again.

783
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:04,439
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go.

784
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:06,916
Come let's go. Where did they came from?

785
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,400
Come on. Now say sorry and move on.

786
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:18,291
Forgiveness is part of life.

787
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:23,010
Girls look more preety
when they are angry.

788
00:37:25,824 --> 00:37:26,252
Sorry.

789
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,432
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

790
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:32,557
Sorry.

791
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:42,953
(Motorcycle Horn)

792
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:43,843
Jaggi, where are you?

793
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:46,843
Papers are ready.
We need to deliver the car.

794
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:48,624
I was about to some, bro..

795
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:51,945
..but I had some rotten
Bhatures (snack) last night.

796
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:54,069
I keep visiting the
restroom every two minutes.

797
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,001
Wait, let me drink the medicine.

798
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,940
It is very bitter.

799
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:02,609
I'll suggest why don’t
you deliver the car?

800
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,726
You know that we have to
deliver the car to a girl's place.

801
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,639
And I stay away from girls.

802
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,483
I know, bro.
But the thing is that I cannot make it.

803
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:12,530
Those Bhatures have messed up my system.

804
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:13,526
You..!

805
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:14,805
(Traffic)

806
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:18,054
What are you doing?

807
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:19,647
Mr. Balli is such a nice person.

808
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:21,062
Why are you cheating him?

809
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,968
I am doing this so
that I can become an uncle.

810
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:24,968
Wait, let me explain.

811
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:33,673
The thing is Mr. Balli stays
away from girls. - Okay.

812
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:35,481
- And he isn't ready to get married.
- Okay.

813
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,056
But I have decided that
I'll get him married anyhow.

814
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,272
Listen to me, Neelu.

815
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,939
Papa has found match for me.

816
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,571
Some Major Gulati.

817
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:45,509
Papa cannot stop praising him.

818
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:46,892
- Rinky!
- Yes, papa.

819
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:48,345
I'll call you back later.

820
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,201
- Rinky, listen..
- Yes?

821
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:53,507
Come dear. Sit.

822
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,065
Look dear, I have made this decision..

823
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,050
..to secure your future
and your happiness.

824
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:02,026
I don’t want to delay
your marriage any further.

825
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:04,025
We will go to Chandigarh tomorrow..

826
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:06,339
..to meet Major Gulati and his family.

827
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,393
- But papa..
- Either start packing for Chandigarh..

828
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,604
..or within three
minutes prove it to me..

829
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:13,214
..that you like someone else.

830
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:14,815
Papa, give me some time at least.

831
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,002
Yes. It's will be on time.

832
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:17,885
Hey, I have been trying to call you.

833
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,130
Thank God you are here.
Come in.

834
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,979
Papa, you were asking who's in my life?

835
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:24,698
Papa, it's him.
My love, my future, my everything!

836
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:26,799
- Thank God you came.
- But I have come to..

837
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:27,796
Yes, it's okay.

838
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:29,141
Papa, he's the one.

839
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:29,932
I..

840
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,454
- Okay..
- The documents..

841
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,348
Very nice.

842
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,093
It's a pleasure.
It's indeed a pleasure.

843
00:39:35,836 --> 00:39:37,075
I am Colonel Vohra.

844
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,357
Balwinder Arora, Balli.

845
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:39,671
Oh, very nice.

846
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,045
Do you love each other or just..

847
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,428
No, papa.
He loves me a lot.

848
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:46,053
Right?

849
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:51,374
You know what?
You have come at the right time.

850
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:52,671
Papa was trapping me.

851
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:54,835
Actually, I would've been totally
trapped if you hadn’t showed up.

852
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:56,530
Papa has chosen someone for me.

853
00:39:56,555 --> 00:39:58,108
But I don’t like him at all.

854
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:00,780
I mean I cannot marry
someone who is like papa.

855
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,077
But it's not that there
isn't anyone in my life.

856
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:03,817
There is someone.

857
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:04,334
(Traffic)

858
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:05,418
His name is Tillu.

859
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:07,547
And he too likes me.

860
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:10,227
Actually, I too.. I too like him a lot.

861
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:11,958
That's why I did all this drama.

862
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:13,562
I am so sorry. So sorry!

863
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:14,475
It's okay.

864
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,549
These are the documents of your car.

865
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:18,264
Well..

866
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:19,952
Take them.

867
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:21,993
I am really very sorry
for what happened inside.

868
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:23,898
I didn’t mean that.
I was just doing drama.

869
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,686
Please.. I was really just pretending.

870
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:26,710
I am so sorry. Listen..

871
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:28,523
Please listen.. hello!

872
00:40:33,303 --> 00:40:34,897
(Cell Phone Ringing)

873
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,420
Hello?

874
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,449
Hello, Balli, it's me, Rinky.

875
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,325
Actually, you know what?

876
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,496
There is a lot going
on in my mind and heart.

877
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:46,863
And I cannot handle it.

878
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:47,988
I tried calling Kanika.

879
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,192
Her phone is switched off.

880
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:50,285
Then I tried calling Kanchan.

881
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,410
She is entertaining guests at home.

882
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:54,076
And Neelu, her phone is unreachable
since the past two days.

883
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,574
No one has time to talk to me.

884
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:59,551
Okay, can I talk to you?

885
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:01,699
Yes, tell me.

886
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:05,911
You know what?

887
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:08,419
I have had a motherless childhood.

888
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,215
Papa brought me up.

889
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:10,923
And you know what?

890
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,787
Papa only does what he wants.
What he thinks is right.

891
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,012
I mean it is going to happen.

892
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:17,731
When and with whom it will happen,
that subject..

893
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:20,168
Look Balli, I know that
we have had just a small meeting.

894
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:20,918
But I know.

895
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:22,793
Okay listen, I have decided that..

896
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:25,262
..I should leave with
Tillu while handling your case.

897
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,582
There are hardly any
days left in November.

898
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:27,207
I will leave with him.

899
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:28,098
And on top of that Bhasin and Goldie!

900
00:41:28,123 --> 00:41:29,163
Their pressure is something
different all together.

901
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:31,782
And the person I love,
Tillu, he is so dumb!

902
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:32,720
I just don’t understand.

903
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:33,865
I am dreaming about Gulati nowadays.

904
00:41:33,922 --> 00:41:35,658
He jumps four times
and five men fall flat.

905
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,419
Balli, hello, are you listening to me?

906
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:42,076
Yes, I am listening.

907
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:43,141
Yes, of course, I am.

908
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:44,843
Gulati killed four people.

909
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:45,595
Go on.

910
00:41:48,251 --> 00:41:49,384
Thank you so much.

911
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:52,697
Okay then, you go to sleep.

912
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:55,071
And thank you once again.

913
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,549
Good night.

914
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:03,563
Jaggi.

915
00:42:03,712 --> 00:42:06,368
- Coming, bro.
- Jaggi.

916
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,989
What's the problem with Bhatia's car?

917
00:42:09,024 --> 00:42:10,237
He has already called
me 2 times since morning.

918
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:12,572
Forget his car, bro.
I will handle it.

919
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,251
There's a girl waiting for you inside.

920
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:14,767
Which girl?

921
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:16,072
Colonel's daughter.

922
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:18,405
She said she wants
to talk to you urgently.

923
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:21,618
I'd suggest if things look
positive then you should go for it.

924
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,280
The wedding season is on.

925
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,530
You..!

926
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,095
I'll see you later.

927
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,103
Lord Almighty, please be with him.

928
00:42:31,794 --> 00:42:35,095
Balli, I couldn’t sleep last night.

929
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,588
I don’t know what I am doing.

930
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:40,243
And I don’t know whether
what I am doing is right or wrong.

931
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,840
I don’t know.

932
00:42:42,705 --> 00:42:45,447
I had that with Tillu..
what just happens..

933
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:48,150
And a girl does that only..

934
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,830
..when it happens to her
for the first time in life.

935
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,113
And you know what?

936
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:54,611
I don’t have that with Tillu.

937
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:56,701
I have that..

938
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:58,166
I have that with you.

939
00:42:58,673 --> 00:42:59,233
Yes.

940
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:08,796
You..

941
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:13,733
What is it that you..

942
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:18,897
Don’t have with Tillu
and have it with me?

943
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:21,164
Love.

944
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:24,217
I don’t love Tillu.

945
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,155
I love you.

946
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:29,866
And.. I want to marry you.

947
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:37,616
Yes, I agree that I was going to
marry him before you entered my life.

948
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,223
I used to love him as well.

949
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:41,905
But you know what?

950
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:43,804
From the time, you have entered my life..

951
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:51,210
It's you I see everywhere and not Tillu.

952
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:54,704
I think you..

953
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:59,001
You should get your mind checked.

954
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,478
Not my mind, my heart.

955
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,316
And only you can do that.

956
00:44:05,424 --> 00:44:07,571
Look, please..
Please don’t reject me.

957
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:12,181
If you reject me then
I won't be able to live.

958
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:13,923
Do you..

959
00:44:15,977 --> 00:44:17,446
..know what you are saying?

960
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:20,101
Yes, I know.

961
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:22,313
And I am not saying so, my heart is.

962
00:44:22,338 --> 00:44:23,618
Look, listen..

963
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,618
Whatever I had with Tillu,
it was my childishness.

964
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:27,637
But..

965
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:33,665
But you are the one
I am actually in love with.

966
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:37,056
That's amazing!
That's amazing, bro!

967
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:41,344
I knew that you two
are made for each other.

968
00:44:41,797 --> 00:44:42,931
God has answered my prayer.

969
00:44:43,152 --> 00:44:45,344
Jaggi's wish has come true!

970
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,446
- That's amazing!
- Hey!

971
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:50,608
She is your sister-in-law.

972
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:51,680
Being possessive, bro?

973
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:53,825
No problem,
she can be my sister-in-law.

974
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:57,992
"Not my fault."

975
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:06,493
"I like you, that's all I know."

976
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:11,124
"It was meant to be hence
I fell in love with you."

977
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:15,269
"I say it with all my heart,
it's true."

978
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:19,766
"It was meant to be hence
I fell in love with you."

979
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:23,601
"I say it with all my heart,
it's true."

980
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:27,072
"I only belong to you."

981
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,630
"So many faces.."

982
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,131
"I came across.."

983
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:16,405
"But my heart fell for you."

984
00:46:16,963 --> 00:46:21,144
"Love has brought me.."

985
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:24,311
"To a path unknown.."

986
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:33,316
"I find it difficult to survive.."

987
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,380
"It was meant to be hence
I fell in love with you."

988
00:46:39,493 --> 00:46:43,293
"I say it with all my heart,
it's true."

989
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:46,935
"I only belong to you."

990
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:48,958
"I love you.."

991
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:51,024
"I love you.."

992
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:53,123
"I love you.."

993
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:55,315
"I love you.."

994
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:57,390
"I love you.."

995
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:59,424
"I love you.."

996
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:04,435
Veer, why is it so loud?
Keep the volume down, son.

997
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:05,574
Mom, please.

998
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:06,540
What please?

999
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:08,605
- Mom, sit in the other room.
- Volume..

1000
00:47:08,629 --> 00:47:09,661
Keep the volume down..

1001
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,051
So that we can at least talk.

1002
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,457
This is not the place to talk.

1003
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,006
Hey!

1004
00:47:15,007 --> 00:47:16,223
(Cell Phone Ringing)

1005
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:18,465
There, Balli is calling.

1006
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,121
- You want to talk him?
- No.

1007
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:24,488
Hello?

1008
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:27,629
Aunt, your wish is getting fulfilled.

1009
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:29,475
I am getting married.

1010
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:31,670
The truth, Balli?

1011
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:33,783
Yes, I have found someone.

1012
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:35,488
You should prepare for our wedding.

1013
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:36,830
Come soon.

1014
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:39,299
You see..

1015
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:42,064
Balli has found a nice girl.

1016
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:42,783
Good.

1017
00:47:43,144 --> 00:47:44,285
Now tell me about your girl.

1018
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:45,522
Huh?

1019
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,010
Tell me about your girl.

1020
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:48,332
Mom, please.

1021
00:47:48,845 --> 00:47:49,604
Listen..

1022
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:52,134
My friend's niece is very beautiful.

1023
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:55,490
She is lovely.
Should I talk to her family?

1024
00:47:55,701 --> 00:47:56,221
Mom..?

1025
00:47:56,602 --> 00:47:57,602
Dad wouldn’t like that.

1026
00:47:57,734 --> 00:47:58,615
He likes you.

1027
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:02,178
I am talk about you.

1028
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,365
Okay.

1029
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:07,740
Mom, I am still just a child.

1030
00:48:08,707 --> 00:48:10,026
And when will you grow up?

1031
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,037
Mom, please.
Let me play.

1032
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:15,943
Do you want to spend
your whole life playing, son?

1033
00:48:15,968 --> 00:48:17,139
When will you get married?

1034
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:20,108
And listen, what about that girl..

1035
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:22,787
..you take on drives
and burn so much gas?

1036
00:48:26,384 --> 00:48:27,678
Tolaram told me.

1037
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:29,338
Mom..

1038
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:31,334
Tolaram is a blabbermouth.

1039
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:33,160
Forget the blabbermouth.

1040
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,091
If you like her then
take things forward..

1041
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:36,506
..and introduce her to me.

1042
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:38,217
I will handle the rest.

1043
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:40,928
I have been telling Veer
to introduce me to everyone.

1044
00:48:40,953 --> 00:48:42,568
But he doesn’t listen to me, auntie.

1045
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:43,248
Auntie?

1046
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,615
Don’t address me as auntie, dear.

1047
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,287
Call me mom.

1048
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:46,967
Mom?

1049
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,299
Mom..

1050
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:51,437
It sounds so nice.

1051
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:52,801
Listen..

1052
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:56,724
He loves to hum Lataji's
songs while eating parathas.

1053
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,279
She is my favorite.
I love her.

1054
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:00,443
- Really?
- Yes.

1055
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,029
If he asks you to hum a little,
please do that for him.

1056
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:05,326
- Okay, sure.
- Mom.

1057
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:07,877
Her name is Geet,
but she cannot sing at all.

1058
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:08,521
Veer!

1059
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,982
He is always pulling my leg, mom.

1060
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:12,256
- Don’t worry, dear.
- I sing quite well.

1061
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:13,654
Of course you do, dear.

1062
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:16,188
And he likes to have
kidney beans with paratha.

1063
00:49:16,393 --> 00:49:17,100
Right, Veer?

1064
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,422
I don’t know how to cook kidney beans.

1065
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:20,279
My paratha got burnt.

1066
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:22,623
Mom, it's charred.

1067
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:25,715
Mom, the tea!
Switch it off!

1068
00:49:27,037 --> 00:49:27,998
Now.. this..?

1069
00:49:28,976 --> 00:49:30,255
I cannot do all this.

1070
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,256
I cannot do this acting.

1071
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:33,670
This is how the paratha
I make looks like.

1072
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:35,115
They get burnt or whatever.

1073
00:49:35,157 --> 00:49:36,006
This is how I make them.

1074
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,005
I told you before. Why are you laughing?

1075
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:41,373
Forget about the food..

1076
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:47,428
What's more important that
she should have a good heart!

1077
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:48,576
And she has a good heart.

1078
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,108
You ate that charred paratha?

1079
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:55,560
Veer, this is the first time in your
life you have done something right.

1080
00:49:55,585 --> 00:49:56,826
You have found a nice girl.

1081
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:57,773
Right?

1082
00:49:58,326 --> 00:49:58,990
Heard that?

1083
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:01,464
She isn't a good cook.

1084
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,209
Geet, you know, I had gone my village.

1085
00:50:09,314 --> 00:50:11,318
My grandfather made me go crazy.

1086
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:13,052
He has chosen some boy for me.

1087
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,966
And even my father
cannot speak against him.

1088
00:50:15,586 --> 00:50:16,626
Are you getting me?

1089
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:19,133
What kind of a boy he must
be if my grandfather likes him?

1090
00:50:19,158 --> 00:50:20,186
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

1091
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,779
You didn’t meet him
and he finalized everything?

1092
00:50:22,804 --> 00:50:23,552
No!

1093
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:25,216
All these oldies are just the same.

1094
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:27,585
Anyway, my grandfather
listens to his moustaches..

1095
00:50:27,627 --> 00:50:28,670
..and does what he thinks is right.

1096
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:30,119
This is a limit.

1097
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:31,095
Seriously.

1098
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:31,912
Could you like some tea?

1099
00:50:32,014 --> 00:50:32,974
No.
Got liquor?

1100
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:34,385
Whiskey or Vodka?

1101
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:36,389
Here's my wedding invitation.

1102
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:37,800
Are you serious?

1103
00:50:38,189 --> 00:50:40,677
You fixed a date and
even got the invites printed.

1104
00:50:40,702 --> 00:50:41,302
Yes.

1105
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:43,037
Eager much?

1106
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:44,553
Eager, really?

1107
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:47,186
Rahul?

1108
00:50:47,813 --> 00:50:48,889
Such a filmy name.

1109
00:50:50,983 --> 00:50:51,929
It's a pretty invite though.

1110
00:50:52,267 --> 00:50:53,148
Thanks.

1111
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:54,241
Tell me something..

1112
00:50:54,674 --> 00:50:56,241
What's your status with Veer?

1113
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,726
I'm under a lot of stress.

1114
00:50:57,865 --> 00:50:58,465
Why?

1115
00:50:58,924 --> 00:51:00,506
I still haven't told my family.

1116
00:51:00,712 --> 00:51:01,392
Oh.

1117
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:03,796
You better hurry up.

1118
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,714
Otherwise, you too will have
to marry someone your parents choose.

1119
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:09,100
Only you can do that.

1120
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:12,046
Send 10 kilo Barfi (sweets)
and 5 kilo Balushahi (sweets)..

1121
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:14,208
..along with cashews to Mr. Gupta's..

1122
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:15,210
Hello, uncle.

1123
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,281
Ria!

1124
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:19,761
I will call you later.

1125
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,479
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello, dear.

1126
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:23,278
When did you come back from Rivadhi?

1127
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:24,478
We came yesterday.

1128
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:25,265
Okay.

1129
00:51:25,308 --> 00:51:27,028
And here's my wedding invite.

1130
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:30,136
That's great.

1131
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:31,854
Your wedding invite.

1132
00:51:33,228 --> 00:51:34,788
Congratulations.

1133
00:51:35,076 --> 00:51:37,596
It's quite nice and cheap.

1134
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:38,487
Papa!

1135
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:40,514
I'm just joking.

1136
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:43,478
- Uncle, all of you have to attend it.
- Yes, all of us will attend it.

1137
00:51:43,503 --> 00:51:45,089
The whole family.

1138
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:48,125
Dear, you should someone for yourself.

1139
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:51,675
Now you should find someone
for your best friend too.

1140
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:52,949
Papa!

1141
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:54,864
Uncle, there's Veer..

1142
00:51:56,122 --> 00:51:57,542
Veer?
Who is he?

1143
00:51:58,605 --> 00:51:59,765
Geet's boyfriend.

1144
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:01,597
Mad..

1145
00:52:01,704 --> 00:52:02,464
Boyfriend?

1146
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:03,324
No.. Shutup..

1147
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:04,954
Geet..

1148
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,167
Why are you making such gestures?

1149
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,650
This is good news.

1150
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:14,319
Why do you look so worried?

1151
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,527
You should ballroom in the room.

1152
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:21,470
Ria, she solved our problem in no time.

1153
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:26,027
Look dear, if you like
someone then introduce him to us.

1154
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,423
We will talk to him.

1155
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:31,276
We will take things
forward and finalize it.

1156
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:31,917
Okay?

1157
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:33,854
Bye.

1158
00:52:34,405 --> 00:52:36,355
I'll go and give the
good news to your mother.

1159
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,740
Okay?

1160
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:37,627
Juhi!

1161
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:38,755
Juhi!

1162
00:52:39,013 --> 00:52:39,893
Juhi!

1163
00:52:42,438 --> 00:52:43,678
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1164
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,112
How did this happen?

1165
00:52:45,137 --> 00:52:46,136
- I don’t know.
- Veer!

1166
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:47,253
I'll inform Veer.

1167
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,238
- What are you looking at?
- Show it to me, please.

1168
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,381
- No.
- Please!

1169
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:52,817
- No!
- Please.

1170
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:04,190
Listen..

1171
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:06,433
Don’t talk much in front of papa.

1172
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:09,488
Papa loves to talk.

1173
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:11,277
I know.

1174
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:12,831
How do you know?

1175
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:16,211
Because all the fathers are the same.

1176
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:24,472
Listen..

1177
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,816
Don’t share the tales
of your bravery with papa.

1178
00:53:29,426 --> 00:53:31,652
He hates people who fight.

1179
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:35,402
Will you remember what all I taught you?

1180
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:37,222
Please?

1181
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:38,996
What have you taught me?

1182
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:41,222
Madam..

1183
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:43,464
I am quite mind-blowing.

1184
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,097
I agree.

1185
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,808
Son, I was drowning..

1186
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,636
I started shouting for help.

1187
00:53:56,237 --> 00:53:58,159
- A lifeguard came to save me.
- Thank you.

1188
00:53:58,596 --> 00:54:01,285
But poor thing, instead of saving me..

1189
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:02,745
..he himself got into trouble.

1190
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:07,789
It's okay, papa.

1191
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:09,266
Now I will teach you how to swim.

1192
00:54:13,327 --> 00:54:14,087
Papa?

1193
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:20,166
He got worried.

1194
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:20,992
Fine.

1195
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,091
I learnt how to drown..
you can teach me how to swim.

1196
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:25,839
Very good.

1197
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:38,718
- Hey, you scoundrel!
- What happened?

1198
00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:41,198
What are you doing?

1199
00:54:41,223 --> 00:54:42,309
- Get lost!
- Karan.

1200
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:44,894
What did you say?
What did you say?

1201
00:54:45,638 --> 00:54:49,483
What did you say?
Are you trying to be smart.

1202
00:54:49,693 --> 00:54:50,833
Say it again. What did you say?

1203
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:52,137
Hey! What are you doing?

1204
00:54:52,988 --> 00:54:53,801
Who are you?

1205
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:10,853
Where are you, bro?

1206
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,982
Mummy, you didn’t have anything.

1207
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,200
I am, son.

1208
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:19,071
I don't care about this world.

1209
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,286
Veer..

1210
00:55:25,946 --> 00:55:28,489
You should try the Thandia papa makes.

1211
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:33,091
Dear, you know that I haven't
made it since a long time.

1212
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,156
No, papa.
You should make some for Veer.

1213
00:55:36,188 --> 00:55:38,347
Thandia keeps the mind calm.

1214
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:41,388
No. You are mistaken, dear.

1215
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,591
You don’t need Thandia to keep calm.

1216
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:48,028
You need control to
yourself to keep calm.

1217
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:49,599
You need to control your anger.

1218
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:52,283
Hey you guys. Stop.

1219
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:55,345
Anyway, he doesn’t need Thandia.

1220
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,966
Does he get angry?

1221
00:55:57,405 --> 00:55:58,880
Does he pick up fights?

1222
00:55:58,979 --> 00:56:00,219
Does he beat up people?

1223
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,385
He doesn’t need Thandia, dear.
No, I don't think so.

1224
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,450
Papa, I will be right back.

1225
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,974
- Veer, the food will go cold.
- Let him go, dear.

1226
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:09,802
You can go later.

1227
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:10,857
I will be right back.

1228
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:11,825
Papa..

1229
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,639
Come back soon, son.

1230
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:14,851
Okay?

1231
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:29,261
Look, your daddy's here.

1232
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:51,828
See, how he's bashing them up.

1233
00:56:53,886 --> 00:56:55,240
What is that noise?

1234
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:57,630
Is someone fighting?

1235
00:56:57,655 --> 00:56:59,535
No papa, something must
be having on the street.

1236
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,119
- Let it be, papa.
- Let me go and check, dear.

1237
00:57:01,144 --> 00:57:03,333
Papa, why are you interfering
in someone else's matters?

1238
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:04,678
Mamma, tell him..

1239
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:05,505
Calm down.

1240
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:07,283
Let him go.

1241
00:57:37,547 --> 00:57:38,401
Let's run.

1242
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:13,922
Idiot!

1243
00:58:14,185 --> 00:58:16,297
He thinks I will let
my daughter marry him.

1244
00:58:16,298 --> 00:58:17,364
(Cell Phone Ringing)

1245
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,630
- Veer, I will call you back.
- Geet!

1246
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:20,892
- Papa!
- Give me your phone!

1247
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:24,283
Hey you..

1248
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:26,023
Whatever your name is..

1249
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,630
Get this straight.

1250
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:31,937
Never try to meet or call Geet again.

1251
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:35,335
I don’t want my daughter
to marry someone..

1252
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:37,179
..who raises his hands on others.

1253
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:38,898
Someone who is a goon.

1254
00:58:39,651 --> 00:58:40,213
Goodbye.

1255
00:58:45,248 --> 00:58:46,048
Papa, please..

1256
00:58:46,146 --> 00:58:46,765
Mamma, papa..

1257
00:59:16,357 --> 00:59:17,157
Yes, father.

1258
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:19,271
We have found a very
nice girl for Veerey.

1259
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:20,740
Yes.

1260
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:23,005
You should make your preparations.

1261
00:59:23,304 --> 00:59:24,451
We will soon fix an auspicious date.

1262
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:25,373
Yes.

1263
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:32,255
(Water Sound)
What?

1264
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,913
They rejected you?

1265
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:36,680
Yes, brother.

1266
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:38,768
Don’t worry.

1267
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:40,990
I'll talk some sense into Bhalla.

1268
00:59:43,828 --> 00:59:44,588
Bhalla!

1269
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,380
Bhalla!

1270
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:49,943
Who is Bhalla?

1271
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:55,907
How can you just barge in?
Didn’t the security guard stop you?

1272
00:59:55,982 --> 00:59:56,685
Who are you?

1273
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:00,537
What's going on?

1274
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:03,095
I am Balli, Veer's elder brother.

1275
01:00:03,835 --> 01:00:05,514
So you think Veer is a goon?

1276
01:00:05,884 --> 01:00:07,787
Our family fights for the country.

1277
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:13,747
You know my grandpa captured
dacoit Durjan Singh.

1278
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:15,932
We come from a family of fighters.

1279
01:00:16,022 --> 01:00:17,451
And you think we are goons!

1280
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:21,990
No matter how hard you try,
you won't a boy better than Veer.

1281
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,279
I have only come here to tell you that..

1282
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:26,973
..if my brother's feelings get hurt..

1283
01:00:27,428 --> 01:00:30,748
..then I will start a fire
right here and fry Immartis (sweets).

1284
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:34,279
I will make heartbroken
lovers sing outside your house.

1285
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:37,833
Taiyab Ali hates love, shame on you!

1286
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:40,257
You will lose your image.

1287
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:42,027
And forget about your girl's wedding..

1288
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,193
No one will even show
up to buy your sweets.

1289
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:45,810
Got it?

1290
01:00:53,936 --> 01:00:55,529
You have 48 hours.

1291
01:00:57,308 --> 01:00:58,560
Come home and accept the proposal.

1292
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:00,394
Hey.

1293
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:01,960
Keep quiet.

1294
01:01:07,979 --> 01:01:08,854
(Bell Sound)

1295
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:15,440
Now only Prabhu can save us.

1296
01:01:16,534 --> 01:01:17,206
(Door Close sound)

1297
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:20,807
Balli, what you did was not right.

1298
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,518
She is still not our daughter-in-law.

1299
01:01:24,086 --> 01:01:24,940
She is their daughter.

1300
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,924
Wait till the evening.
He will come bearing gifts.

1301
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,406
(Cell Phone Ringing)
You just wait and watch.

1302
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:30,534
She is right.

1303
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,006
Why did you have to go there?

1304
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:33,719
Hello?

1305
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:35,411
- He got a call.
- Have you gone crazy?

1306
01:01:35,436 --> 01:01:37,196
Is your whole family crazy?

1307
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:38,661
Why?

1308
01:01:39,374 --> 01:01:39,934
What happened?

1309
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:41,134
What happened!

1310
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,908
Your brother.. What is his name?

1311
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:44,533
Malli?

1312
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:45,875
What is his name?

1313
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:47,401
- Balli bro?
- Yes, him.

1314
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,924
What does he think of himself?

1315
01:01:48,949 --> 01:01:50,589
He threatened my papa.

1316
01:01:50,784 --> 01:01:52,024
Papa is right.

1317
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:54,994
You are a goon,
your whole family is full of goons.

1318
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:56,823
You guys just don’t have any sense.

1319
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,174
Good that your brother came
and showed us his true colors.

1320
01:01:59,199 --> 01:01:59,698
I had a narrow escape.

1321
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,760
And yes, there is a message
for your parents as well.

1322
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:05,377
Papa asked me to tell
them not to commit the sin..

1323
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:07,297
..of trapping an innocent
girl from a good family.

1324
01:02:07,322 --> 01:02:09,619
They should look for
a girl from a family of goons.

1325
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,299
I am deleting your number.

1326
01:02:11,324 --> 01:02:12,964
Don’t try to come after me.

1327
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,159
I am warning you.

1328
01:02:15,255 --> 01:02:18,034
These days government is
doing a lot to protect girls.

1329
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:21,034
Cops have been given thick batons,
so you better beware.

1330
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:21,950
Bye.

1331
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:29,533
(Instrumental Music)

1332
01:02:32,089 --> 01:02:32,889
Sorry.

1333
01:02:35,136 --> 01:02:37,456
I ruined it for you.

1334
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,391
It's okay, bro.

1335
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:45,596
You didn’t know.

1336
01:02:54,790 --> 01:03:00,032
Please have the juice.
Have some sweets too.

1337
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,016
Brother, you won't find
such sweets anywhere in Delhi.

1338
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:07,071
But you will find the complete
taste of Delhi in them.

1339
01:03:08,553 --> 01:03:11,579
Gets the Immartis (sweets).

1340
01:03:11,604 --> 01:03:14,266
Our special guest is here.

1341
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:17,844
By the way,
what did you say your name was?

1342
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:19,533
Prabhu Arora.

1343
01:03:22,193 --> 01:03:23,821
- Just Arora.
- Okay.

1344
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:27,040
Mr. Bhalla, my son..

1345
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:28,922
Not a son, a goon.

1346
01:03:29,548 --> 01:03:30,668
Younger one is a goon.

1347
01:03:30,818 --> 01:03:32,438
And the elder one is a super goon.

1348
01:03:33,052 --> 01:03:36,125
One shamelessly breaks
bones on the streets.

1349
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:41,298
And the other wants to come to my
house, start a fire and fry Immartis.

1350
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:43,223
And now their father has showed up.

1351
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:44,783
The leader of those goons.

1352
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,028
So, what have you brought with you?

1353
01:03:47,538 --> 01:03:48,298
Firearm?

1354
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:49,331
Gun?

1355
01:03:49,928 --> 01:03:50,968
AK47?

1356
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:52,375
Atom bomb?

1357
01:03:52,684 --> 01:03:53,401
What have you brought?

1358
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:55,221
Mr. Bhalla, please listen to me.

1359
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,455
What's there to listen?

1360
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,932
Goons don’t talk.

1361
01:03:58,151 --> 01:03:59,760
They use their hands and legs to explain.

1362
01:04:00,675 --> 01:04:04,955
Look, even if you point a gun here..

1363
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:08,690
..I won't let my
daughter Geet marry Veer.

1364
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:12,885
I think you are done
with the refreshments.

1365
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:16,391
You should stand up and leave now.

1366
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:17,603
Go.

1367
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:19,675
Goodbye.

1368
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,626
Sorry, Mr. Prabhu.

1369
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:30,024
I think he doesn’t like my name.

1370
01:04:31,813 --> 01:04:32,501
Bye.

1371
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:33,299
Bye.

1372
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:41,759
He wants Geet to marry his son.

1373
01:04:42,265 --> 01:04:45,118
Now it's my turn to trouble
him in the middle of the night.

1374
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:47,757
(Cell Phone Ringing)

1375
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:53,728
Who is calling me at this hour?

1376
01:04:57,108 --> 01:04:57,708
Hello?

1377
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:01,092
Hello, is that Mr. Prabhu Arora?

1378
01:05:02,091 --> 01:05:03,372
Yes, speaking.

1379
01:05:03,685 --> 01:05:08,520
Mr. Arora, I just had a fresh dream.

1380
01:05:09,146 --> 01:05:11,682
Do you know what I dreamed about?

1381
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:18,780
I dreamed that a lunatic
is eating watermelon in the market.

1382
01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:27,348
When I took a closer at him,
I realized that it is P.K. Arora.

1383
01:05:31,685 --> 01:05:37,297
Mr. Arora,
I can see signs of lunacy in you.

1384
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:41,481
You know what, you should
show yourself to a good doctor.

1385
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:43,940
It will keep the lunacy in control.

1386
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:48,083
Bye.

1387
01:05:49,786 --> 01:05:50,554
Who was it?

1388
01:05:55,186 --> 01:05:56,107
What happened?

1389
01:05:57,106 --> 01:05:58,471
Lunatic.

1390
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:01,115
Whom were you talking
to so late in the night?

1391
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:03,567
A lunatic.

1392
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:04,958
A lunatic?

1393
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,036
Have you lost your mind?

1394
01:06:11,882 --> 01:06:12,911
Oh Prabhu!

1395
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:14,481
I hope I don’t go crazy.

1396
01:06:20,629 --> 01:06:21,397
Good evening, sir.

1397
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:23,284
Good evening.
Is the report ready?

1398
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,316
What's the name of the patient?

1399
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:25,301
Gopi Bhalla.

1400
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:26,966
Wait for a minute, please.

1401
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:32,761
Hello?

1402
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:34,921
Hello, yes?
Hello?

1403
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:37,726
Hello, I can't hear you.
Hello?

1404
01:06:38,137 --> 01:06:39,404
Yes?
One, two, three?

1405
01:06:39,445 --> 01:06:41,731
Check up, check up?
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1406
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,682
Hello? Why can't I hear you?

1407
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:45,557
You can’t hear me?

1408
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:47,665
But I can hear you.

1409
01:06:47,706 --> 01:06:50,321
I don't know what is going on?

1410
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:52,127
Is my report ready?

1411
01:06:52,168 --> 01:06:53,529
Yeah, here's your report.

1412
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:54,809
- Give me the report, sir.
- Thank you.

1413
01:06:56,149 --> 01:06:57,309
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1414
01:06:57,962 --> 01:06:59,235
Let me try again.

1415
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,336
Mad. He is completely mad.

1416
01:07:07,243 --> 01:07:09,494
Blood pressure, okay.
Uric acid, okay.

1417
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:10,939
Cholesterol, okay.
Sugar..

1418
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:13,284
Sugar, 600!

1419
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:15,537
Juhi, my sugar is 600!

1420
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:19,032
- Phulan, stop adding sugar in my tea.
- Okay.

1421
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:21,621
I will give your bitter
gourd juice from tomorrow.

1422
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:22,688
Oh.

1423
01:07:23,994 --> 01:07:26,032
(Cell Phone Ringing)
600! 600!

1424
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:30,372
- Hello?
- Not hello, bellow!

1425
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:34,184
When one's sugar level reaches 600,
he bellows.

1426
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:35,747
And you are saying hello?

1427
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,188
Remember my name, Prabhu Arora.

1428
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:45,684
Gopi..

1429
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,997
This isn't your report.

1430
01:07:50,397 --> 01:07:52,454
Look at the patient's name.

1431
01:07:52,543 --> 01:07:53,606
It's Mr. Thakur.

1432
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:55,684
Yes, it says Mr. Thakur.

1433
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:56,197
Yes.

1434
01:07:56,222 --> 01:07:57,876
- So that means it isn't my report.
- No.

1435
01:07:57,901 --> 01:07:59,473
- It is someone else's report.
- Yes.

1436
01:07:59,544 --> 01:08:01,267
- That means I don’t have diabetes.
- No.

1437
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:03,378
- It is normal.
- Absolutely.

1438
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:06,341
Phulan!
Don’t forget to add sugar in my tea.

1439
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:07,509
(Traffic)

1440
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:16,195
What does your father think of himself?

1441
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:23,044
What?

1442
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:24,950
Your father loves to play pranks?

1443
01:08:25,419 --> 01:08:26,571
Not hello, bellow!

1444
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:28,743
When one's sugar level reaches 600,
he bellows.

1445
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:29,996
And you are saying hello?

1446
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,387
Who talks like this?

1447
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:33,891
You know what your father told mine?

1448
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:34,482
What did he say?

1449
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,965
"That you were wearing torn clothes
and having watermelon in the market."

1450
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:39,676
Yes, so here the matter ends.

1451
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,363
Listen..

1452
01:08:40,525 --> 01:08:43,505
We cannot be together
if our fathers can’t get along.

1453
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:46,106
What?
Why did you call me?

1454
01:08:46,303 --> 01:08:47,723
Do you want to sing a duet with me?

1455
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,013
I am not interested in hearing you sing.

1456
01:08:50,403 --> 01:08:52,131
I wanted to find out
what's your mental condition.

1457
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:53,690
Oh, thank you very much.

1458
01:08:53,715 --> 01:08:54,567
It's absolutely fine.

1459
01:08:54,624 --> 01:08:56,544
And now that you are leaving,
it's even better.

1460
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,025
Listen Veer, our paths are different.

1461
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:01,309
Same here.

1462
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:06,520
Then why don’t you delete
my number from your phone?

1463
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,270
(Water Sound)

1464
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:42,549
Wow!

1465
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,376
Beautiful house.

1466
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:46,698
Thank you.

1467
01:09:47,756 --> 01:09:48,408
Let's go.

1468
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:03,261
You stay alone in such a big house?

1469
01:10:03,755 --> 01:10:04,829
Don’t you feel scared?

1470
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:07,071
I do.

1471
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:09,102
That's why I have brought you with me.

1472
01:10:09,469 --> 01:10:10,045
Come.

1473
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:22,513
This is my bedroom.
(Door Close)

1474
01:10:23,217 --> 01:10:25,174
Sorry, it is a little dull.

1475
01:10:25,865 --> 01:10:29,501
You can add whatever colors
you want to it after marriage.

1476
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:37,233
Look Balli,
I want to say something to you.

1477
01:10:37,258 --> 01:10:39,164
I don’t want to hear anything.

1478
01:10:39,205 --> 01:10:41,202
I agree to all your conditions.

1479
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:43,719
You just agree to get married to me soon.

1480
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:47,196
Balli, I met Tillu for two hours.

1481
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,626
And in those two hours I realized that..

1482
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:53,821
..Tillu loves me a lot.

1483
01:10:53,885 --> 01:10:56,813
And if I am not with
him then he will die.

1484
01:10:57,592 --> 01:11:00,356
Look, he is the only
brother to three sisters.

1485
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:04,658
And he is the only support
of his parents and old grandma.

1486
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,368
If.. if anything happens to
him then his poor mother will die.

1487
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:12,758
And if his mother dies
then his old grandma..

1488
01:11:13,329 --> 01:11:14,979
She too is gone.
She will die too.

1489
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:16,505
Though she can live.

1490
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:18,858
Her knees, eyes and everything
else are working fine.

1491
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,897
Everything is working fine.

1492
01:11:20,202 --> 01:11:21,891
In fact, she can recognize
from a distance..

1493
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:23,543
..that her favorite
Rinky is coming to meet her.

1494
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,322
Balli, I hope you understand
what I am trying to say.

1495
01:11:27,347 --> 01:11:31,763
I mean, you are quite sorted
and I know that you understand me.

1496
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:34,743
Balli, listen..

1497
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:38,093
Please adjust in this lifetime?

1498
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:41,469
I will spend the rest of
the seven lifetimes with you.

1499
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,883
Are you leaving?

1500
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,272
Or should I throw you out?

1501
01:11:49,578 --> 01:11:51,037
'God, you are great.'

1502
01:11:51,514 --> 01:11:53,743
'You must have pondered
a lot before writing his fate.'

1503
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:56,715
'You first made Sughanda
leave him and now her.'

1504
01:11:57,374 --> 01:11:58,642
'This girl too is gone.'

1505
01:11:59,056 --> 01:12:01,898
'35-years-old Balli
still remains unmarried.'

1506
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:04,391
Damn her!

1507
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:06,082
(Cell Phone Ringing)

1508
01:12:08,902 --> 01:12:10,016
Go and get water.

1509
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:16,597
Hello?

1510
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:17,618
Where are you?

1511
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:20,952
You haven't visited the
garden since the past two days.

1512
01:12:21,524 --> 01:12:22,715
I hope everything's fine.

1513
01:12:22,848 --> 01:12:25,383
I haven't seen you
since the past two days.

1514
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:27,401
You have seen my face enough.

1515
01:12:27,787 --> 01:12:29,438
- But Shabbo..
- Now if you want to take things forward..

1516
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:30,702
..then get married to me.

1517
01:12:30,836 --> 01:12:33,639
If you can’t marry me then
should I find someone else?

1518
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:34,772
Shabbo!

1519
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:36,196
Shabbo, listen to me.

1520
01:12:36,411 --> 01:12:37,102
Shabbo!

1521
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,495
(Cell Phone Ringing)
Just a second.

1522
01:12:48,516 --> 01:12:48,976
Hello?

1523
01:12:49,513 --> 01:12:51,318
Prabhu, right?

1524
01:12:51,502 --> 01:12:52,278
Yes, father.

1525
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:54,350
You are old.

1526
01:12:54,605 --> 01:12:56,104
You have aged.

1527
01:12:56,394 --> 01:12:58,122
But how can you forget
such an important thing?

1528
01:12:58,345 --> 01:13:00,380
What's the status of Veer's wedding?

1529
01:13:00,854 --> 01:13:02,325
We are working on it, father.

1530
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:03,583
What are you working on?

1531
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:05,134
Hurry up.

1532
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:07,881
Life isn't just your
undergarment business.

1533
01:13:08,244 --> 01:13:09,281
It is much more than that.

1534
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:11,547
I am not into undergarment
business, father.

1535
01:13:11,777 --> 01:13:13,851
Don’t tell me what you do.

1536
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:15,902
You don’t do what you are supposed to do.

1537
01:13:17,923 --> 01:13:20,958
'Now will I get married
if Veer doesn’t?'

1538
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,395
(Traffic)

1539
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:25,083
Did you talk to her?

1540
01:13:25,582 --> 01:13:26,619
What did she say?

1541
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:30,803
I'd suggest we should kidnap the girl..

1542
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,634
..get married in a temple,
seek blessings at the Gurudwara..

1543
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:33,599
..and there the matter ends.

1544
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:34,412
No.

1545
01:13:34,437 --> 01:13:36,395
Let me know if there is any other option.

1546
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:39,813
I agree with Pammi.

1547
01:13:42,247 --> 01:13:45,127
You shouldn’t run too far after girls.

1548
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:47,817
It gets difficult to come back.

1549
01:13:50,235 --> 01:13:51,733
I have brought a new one for you.

1550
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:54,860
What are you saying, Balli bro?

1551
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:57,685
- Look at her, you might like her.
- I don’t want to, bro.

1552
01:13:57,947 --> 01:13:58,884
- There..
- No, I don’t.

1553
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,050
"Let me drink with your eyes."

1554
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,118
Even if there's no light in my abode..

1555
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,447
"I wann be an alcoholic tonight."

1556
01:14:18,472 --> 01:14:20,367
..my buddy's should always be well lit.

1557
01:14:26,423 --> 01:14:29,932
"I feel like flying away with you."

1558
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:33,602
"I say goodbye to the
world and hello to you."

1559
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:37,250
"I feel like flying away with you."

1560
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:41,269
"I say goodbye to the
world and hello to you."

1561
01:14:41,995 --> 01:14:45,528
"Get ready, be my buddy.."

1562
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:49,252
"Open up a little,
o baby don’t be shy."

1563
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:53,165
"Where are you going all alone,
tonight?"

1564
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:56,745
"Baby, where are you off to, tonight?"

1565
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:00,315
"Where are you going all alone,
tonight?"

1566
01:15:00,393 --> 01:15:03,886
"Baby, where are you off to, tonight?"

1567
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:08,571
"Where are you going all alone?"

1568
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:21,857
"Where are you going all alone,
tonight?"

1569
01:15:21,973 --> 01:15:25,429
"Baby, where are you off to, tonight?"

1570
01:15:25,582 --> 01:15:29,499
"Where are you going.. all alone?"

1571
01:15:34,414 --> 01:15:35,995
"Why wander here and there."

1572
01:15:36,273 --> 01:15:37,826
"Come on baby, let's get drunk."

1573
01:15:37,985 --> 01:15:41,595
"You make my heart sing."

1574
01:15:41,761 --> 01:15:43,269
"You are like breaking news."

1575
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,992
"You cause a sensation."

1576
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,632
"What's your view about me, honey?"

1577
01:15:48,747 --> 01:15:51,090
"Oh baby, don’t be crazy."

1578
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:52,598
"Come on, let's get a little tipsy."

1579
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,738
"Because all is forgiven tonight."

1580
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:59,363
"Black dress,
backless, seeks my interest."

1581
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,802
"Rebellious, but what
make me rebel is your hotness."

1582
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:06,096
"Your eyes are like a 90ml shot."

1583
01:16:06,142 --> 01:16:10,034
"The high fails everyone,
but I am all set."

1584
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,894
"I feel like with you I belong."

1585
01:16:14,128 --> 01:16:17,628
"If you say yes,
I will take you along."

1586
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:21,158
"All night, about love, we shall talk."

1587
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:24,651
"I'll sit with you on the rooftop."

1588
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,454
"I feel like with you I belong."

1589
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:31,832
"If you say yes,
I will take you along."

1590
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:35,527
"All night, about love, we shall talk."

1591
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,825
"I'll sit with you on the rooftop."

1592
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:42,584
"This spark of love is shines bright."

1593
01:16:42,738 --> 01:16:46,040
"I would like to romance
you under candle light."

1594
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:50,175
"I don’t want to be alone, tonight."

1595
01:16:50,342 --> 01:16:53,761
"Baby, I want to be with you, tonight."

1596
01:16:53,912 --> 01:16:57,355
"I don’t want to be alone.. tonight."

1597
01:16:57,483 --> 01:17:01,899
"Baby, I want to be with you, tonight."

1598
01:17:07,558 --> 01:17:09,806
"Move it baby on the beat."

1599
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:16,838
"I don’t want to.."

1600
01:17:20,907 --> 01:17:22,406
"I don’t want to.."

1601
01:17:22,942 --> 01:17:25,862
"Lost in your eyes.."

1602
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:30,121
"I wanna to be drunk tonight."

1603
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:32,128
"Lost in your eyes.."

1604
01:17:33,803 --> 01:17:37,067
"I wanna to be drunk tonight."

1605
01:17:37,305 --> 01:17:38,563
(Traffic)

1606
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:42,509
So this is the problem.

1607
01:17:42,686 --> 01:17:43,609
- Okay.
- Madam..

1608
01:17:43,672 --> 01:17:44,670
I get it.

1609
01:17:44,945 --> 01:17:46,211
My name is Rani Chaudhary.

1610
01:17:46,293 --> 01:17:48,042
You cannot hide anything
from Rani Chaudhary.

1611
01:17:48,286 --> 01:17:49,816
70,000 bucks is involved.

1612
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,081
- Rampal.
- Yes, ma'am.

1613
01:17:51,106 --> 01:17:53,026
Go inside and gather all men here.

1614
01:17:53,226 --> 01:17:54,184
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

1615
01:17:54,225 --> 01:17:55,300
Can I leave, ma'am?

1616
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,220
Have a seat, madam.

1617
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,794
Rashida, give her some water.

1618
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:00,001
She already had water.

1619
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:01,120
Then give her a cold drink.

1620
01:18:01,253 --> 01:18:02,135
Okay, madam.

1621
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:03,273
(Cell Phone Ringing)

1622
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:05,245
Hello?

1623
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:06,443
Tell me your name.

1624
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,667
Idiot, why don’t you stop it?

1625
01:18:09,078 --> 01:18:11,076
How many times do I need to
tell you that I am not Rani Mukherjee?

1626
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:12,291
- I am Rani Chaudhary.
- Your cold drink.

1627
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:14,652
Stop troubling me, I am working.
Hang up.

1628
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:18,753
Manager! Give me the details.
70,000 bucks is at stake.

1629
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:19,969
A complaint has been registered.

1630
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,695
And I need to find
out who is the culprit.

1631
01:18:21,735 --> 01:18:23,345
There are so many characters around you.

1632
01:18:23,386 --> 01:18:24,206
Do you suspect anyone?

1633
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:25,498
Can I say something, madam?

1634
01:18:25,523 --> 01:18:27,208
This is what Rani Chaudhary wants.

1635
01:18:27,233 --> 01:18:28,870
You should open your
mouth and say something.

1636
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:29,683
I..

1637
01:18:29,722 --> 01:18:31,143
Madam, please sit down.
Don’t worry.

1638
01:18:31,168 --> 01:18:32,815
- Rashida..
- She's already had a cold drink, madam.

1639
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:34,235
Then get her an ice cream.

1640
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,297
What flavor would you like, madam?

1641
01:18:35,338 --> 01:18:37,877
- Please tell us. - Vanilla, madam.
(Cell Phone Ringing)

1642
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,151
Idiot! Don’t you get it! I'm
in the middle of something important.

1643
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:42,058
I am working, you..

1644
01:18:42,872 --> 01:18:44,081
- Sir!
- Here's your ice cream.

1645
01:18:44,122 --> 01:18:44,652
Yes, sir.

1646
01:18:44,927 --> 01:18:46,271
- No, sir.
- What all we have to do!

1647
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:46,695
Okay, sir.

1648
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:48,183
Okay. Okay, sir.

1649
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:52,357
- Rampal!
- Yes, madam?

1650
01:18:54,565 --> 01:18:56,063
By mistake, we have made a mistake.

1651
01:18:56,103 --> 01:18:57,946
The incident took
place at some other mall.

1652
01:18:57,971 --> 01:18:58,931
We are at the wrong mall.

1653
01:18:59,136 --> 01:19:00,248
- Rashida..
- Yes, madam?

1654
01:19:00,289 --> 01:19:00,634
Let's go.

1655
01:19:00,706 --> 01:19:02,698
- Okay, madam.
- Manager, please forgive us.

1656
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,391
By mistake, I made a mistake.

1657
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:06,988
You sometimes end up making mistakes
while doing your duty seriously.

1658
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:08,542
- Sorry, I got too serious.
- Okay.

1659
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:09,839
Madam, you too may leave.

1660
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:11,999
Now I will leave only
after I finish the ice cream.

1661
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,304
As you wish.

1662
01:19:13,392 --> 01:19:14,120
Let's go.

1663
01:19:15,761 --> 01:19:18,411
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Search everyone!

1664
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,293
All those who have given
money by Bunty, please pay up..

1665
01:19:21,318 --> 01:19:23,079
..otherwise,
you will be sent to prison.

1666
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,916
Bunty, you fooled me and came to a mall?

1667
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:27,718
You are having a good time over here!

1668
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:29,410
You are giving 500 Rs as in tip.

1669
01:19:29,435 --> 01:19:30,625
Take him along!

1670
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,153
You fool Rani Chaudhary!

1671
01:19:32,194 --> 01:19:34,175
What are you saying?
I don’t understand.

1672
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:35,309
Let me explain that again.

1673
01:19:35,665 --> 01:19:38,605
Cancel one Sherwani and two Kurtas.

1674
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:39,303
Okay.

1675
01:19:39,463 --> 01:19:41,847
The rest is as it is.

1676
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:44,831
But the Sherwani is for the groom, sir.

1677
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:46,945
Why are you looking at me?
I am not the groom.

1678
01:19:47,135 --> 01:19:49,815
So you are asking me to cancel
the two turbans for the groom?

1679
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,589
Not both the turbans.

1680
01:19:51,852 --> 01:19:53,196
Cancel one turban.

1681
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:55,659
But the turban is for the groom, sir.

1682
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:56,661
You are repeating the same thing again.

1683
01:19:56,737 --> 01:20:00,308
This turban is for my brother
Veerey who is getting married.

1684
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:02,339
- Got it?
- And your wedding?

1685
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:03,939
(Sighs)

1686
01:20:03,964 --> 01:20:05,340
(Indistinct chatters)

1687
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:06,784
Look there are three single men.

1688
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:09,550
Rahul, Salman-bhai and me.

1689
01:20:10,084 --> 01:20:13,809
We have decided that we
will all get married together.

1690
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:14,892
Now do you get me?

1691
01:20:15,053 --> 01:20:16,551
He wants to know about my marriage.

1692
01:20:16,552 --> 01:20:17,547
(Footsteps)

1693
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:18,986
Listen up!

1694
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:20,004
I have handled the clothes too.

1695
01:20:20,084 --> 01:20:22,261
Listen up!
You refuse to recognize me!

1696
01:20:22,788 --> 01:20:25,136
I smiled and yet you didn’t recognize me.

1697
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:30,206
If even I smile at someone just once,
he will never forget me.

1698
01:20:30,251 --> 01:20:31,456
My name is Rani Chaudhary.

1699
01:20:31,605 --> 01:20:33,063
Why should I remember you?

1700
01:20:33,939 --> 01:20:35,052
Are you Katrina?

1701
01:20:35,443 --> 01:20:37,056
Kangana?
Aishwariya?

1702
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,206
Even if you are,
it makes no difference to me.

1703
01:20:41,195 --> 01:20:44,267
That day you reached before
the team and got into trouble.

1704
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:46,148
Today you must have surely
caused trouble in the mall.

1705
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:47,810
Why will anyone want to remember you?

1706
01:20:47,811 --> 01:20:48,866
(Indistinct chatters)

1707
01:20:48,907 --> 01:20:50,461
You aren't worth remembering.

1708
01:20:51,877 --> 01:20:54,373
Rani Chaudhary is so polite to you.

1709
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:56,542
But you.. you don’t seem
to let go of your attitude.

1710
01:20:56,598 --> 01:20:57,904
I too have some respect here.

1711
01:20:57,985 --> 01:20:59,637
You can try being polite?

1712
01:21:00,028 --> 01:21:01,409
A little, maybe?

1713
01:21:01,428 --> 01:21:03,226
(Vehicle Pass by)

1714
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:05,050
I am in a mess today.

1715
01:21:05,473 --> 01:21:06,906
Please spare me.
(Horn Honking)

1716
01:21:06,907 --> 01:21:08,481
It's a big deal that
I am even talking to you.

1717
01:21:08,506 --> 01:21:09,773
Mr. Balli!

1718
01:21:09,944 --> 01:21:12,265
(Tyres screeching)

1719
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:15,389
(Vehicle vrooming)

1720
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:16,180
(Car Door Opening)

1721
01:21:17,324 --> 01:21:19,171
Sorry if I was rude. (Car Door
Closing) (Vehicle ignition sound)

1722
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:21,745
Do the duty with all your heart, okay?

1723
01:21:22,185 --> 01:21:23,102
(Horn Honking)

1724
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:23,749
(Gasps)

1725
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:24,440
(Cicada Sound)

1726
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:24,981
Hello?

1727
01:21:25,502 --> 01:21:28,652
Listen, we will have to
find a girl for Veerey soon.

1728
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:30,663
Darling, I will come directly
home from the factory.

1729
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,220
I will get a few girls
along if I find any on the way.

1730
01:21:33,543 --> 01:21:35,722
If you like any of them,
you can finalize her.

1731
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:38,620
Hey, we are talking about
our son's wedding here.

1732
01:21:38,919 --> 01:21:40,933
This isn't like grocery shopping.

1733
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:43,258
We should find a suitable one.

1734
01:21:43,325 --> 01:21:45,198
The way your father was talking..

1735
01:21:45,516 --> 01:21:47,858
..it felt like he is
all set to get married.

1736
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:51,130
He was saying that he'd
go to Switzerland on honeymoon.

1737
01:21:51,552 --> 01:21:52,760
- Switzerland!
- Really?

1738
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,066
If he goes to Switzerland
for his honeymoon..

1739
01:21:56,289 --> 01:21:59,331
..then we'll have to go to
the moon to find a girl for our Veerey.

1740
01:22:00,468 --> 01:22:03,272
All our relatives will laugh at us.

1741
01:22:03,411 --> 01:22:04,563
Okay, we will talk once I reach home.

1742
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:05,761
I'll hang up now.

1743
01:22:06,884 --> 01:22:08,112
He never listens..

1744
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:09,378
Oh God!

1745
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:11,283
The situation in my
house is quite different.

1746
01:22:11,284 --> 01:22:12,527
(Indistinct chatters)

1747
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:15,361
My grandfather's brother
wants to marry for the second time.

1748
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:16,586
- What?
- Can you believe it?

1749
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,784
- He's 90 plus.
- Yes!

1750
01:22:19,391 --> 01:22:21,387
And my family wants
me to be done with my first.

1751
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:22,942
This is great.

1752
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,159
Mummy shows me pictures
of new girls every day.

1753
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:26,800
Sometimes it's this girl
sometimes it's that girl.

1754
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:28,452
Her brother does this,
her father does that.

1755
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:30,989
I told her to get me married
to any girl that she likes.

1756
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:32,316
- Really?
- Then what!

1757
01:22:32,523 --> 01:22:33,675
- Well, I will have to listen to her.
- Of course..

1758
01:22:33,717 --> 01:22:34,677
..you should always
listen to your mother.

1759
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,534
Of course, you should.

1760
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:36,319
Right.

1761
01:22:36,442 --> 01:22:38,439
Papa has started looking
for suitable boys for me.

1762
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,551
- And you are cracking jokes over here.
- Geet.. Okay, fine.

1763
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:40,705
But please listen to me.

1764
01:22:41,762 --> 01:22:45,394
So, the first one looks like
Aishwariya Rai. (Horn Honking)

1765
01:22:45,437 --> 01:22:46,941
She has blue eyes.

1766
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,077
Perfect big eyes.

1767
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:49,683
She is just a shade darker than me.

1768
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:50,866
But that's okay, it doesn’t matter.

1769
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,493
Color doesn’t matter.

1770
01:22:52,899 --> 01:22:55,472
The second one,
she is exactly like Katrina.

1771
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:57,099
- Oh.
- Really.

1772
01:22:57,141 --> 01:22:59,597
If both of them stand together,
no one will be able to differentiate.

1773
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,343
She is a little short, but that's okay.

1774
01:23:01,402 --> 01:23:02,285
She'll match with my height.

1775
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:04,587
- Doesn’t matter.
- Oh, you are so adjusting.

1776
01:23:04,629 --> 01:23:05,857
- Obviously.
- Right.

1777
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:08,712
Yesterday,
I told mom that she has me in a fix.

1778
01:23:08,737 --> 01:23:10,941
When I turn over on the bed I night,
on one side there's Katrina..

1779
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:12,277
..and Aishwariya on the other.

1780
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,057
Listen..

1781
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:15,407
(Horn Honking)

1782
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:18,835
These Katrina,
Kareena, Aishwariya, Naagina, Paseena..

1783
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:20,794
..whoever they are, whatever
you want to do with them, do it.

1784
01:23:21,232 --> 01:23:21,886
Got it?

1785
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:24,213
There is just one girl made for you,
Geet Bhalla.

1786
01:23:24,528 --> 01:23:27,597
The sooner you understand
that the better.

1787
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:34,745
SIsn't tonight enough to understand?

1788
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:02,625
- Who are you?
- Sit down!

1789
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:05,223
Veerey, Mr.
Bhalla has called this guy, Amardeep..

1790
01:24:05,264 --> 01:24:06,608
..to talk about marriage with Geet.

1791
01:24:06,633 --> 01:24:08,898
So you want to be Bhalla's son-in-law?

1792
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,421
Get some snacks.

1793
01:24:11,943 --> 01:24:12,835
Have some.

1794
01:24:16,188 --> 01:24:17,444
Have you seen Geet's picture?

1795
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:18,988
(Indistinct chatters)

1796
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:19,612
Yes.

1797
01:24:20,609 --> 01:24:22,609
Have you started dreaming about her?

1798
01:24:23,756 --> 01:24:24,616
Yes, bro.

1799
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:25,905
She is awesome.

1800
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:33,013
We are here to help you.

1801
01:24:33,446 --> 01:24:34,214
Right?

1802
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:37,084
We have brought you here
so that you don’t get rejected.

1803
01:24:37,647 --> 01:24:39,798
This poor guy got rejected.
Tell him what had happened.

1804
01:24:40,266 --> 01:24:40,996
Bro..

1805
01:24:41,204 --> 01:24:43,351
He asked me, do you have courage?

1806
01:24:43,623 --> 01:24:44,813
I said, yes, I do.

1807
01:24:44,897 --> 01:24:47,786
Then he asked, can you hit ten
people on the streets all by yourself?

1808
01:24:48,093 --> 01:24:51,023
I said.. I can manage to hit a few.

1809
01:24:51,164 --> 01:24:53,451
If there are many then I
can use a rod to hit on their heads.

1810
01:24:53,493 --> 01:24:55,834
And I told him what
happened at the petrol pump.

1811
01:24:56,088 --> 01:24:59,257
I hit five people with hockey sticks.

1812
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:00,340
Your turn.

1813
01:25:00,365 --> 01:25:01,796
Don’t ask what happened with me.

1814
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:04,381
He had beaten two, he had beaten five..

1815
01:25:04,645 --> 01:25:07,175
If you can see my size and guess..

1816
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:09,257
I didn’t get you.

1817
01:25:09,386 --> 01:25:11,268
- He had beaten two, he had beaten five..
- He still doesn't get it.

1818
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:12,507
Explain it to him, Veerey.

1819
01:25:12,653 --> 01:25:17,319
Coming to the point, Mr. Bhalla
needs to know what your hands can do.

1820
01:25:17,436 --> 01:25:19,368
The strength in your hands.

1821
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:22,183
He wants to know how
strong my hands are, right?

1822
01:25:22,232 --> 01:25:23,153
I understood.

1823
01:25:24,858 --> 01:25:25,671
- Here.
- Thank you.

1824
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,101
Thank you.

1825
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:29,316
Yes, uncle.

1826
01:25:29,377 --> 01:25:30,491
Son, tell me something..

1827
01:25:30,532 --> 01:25:31,148
Yes, uncle?

1828
01:25:31,277 --> 01:25:32,257
What did you say your name was?

1829
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:34,616
- Amardeep.
- Amardeep, very good name.

1830
01:25:34,657 --> 01:25:35,425
It's a very good name.

1831
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:37,321
What's your education level?

1832
01:25:37,856 --> 01:25:40,378
And what special
talent do you have that..

1833
01:25:40,533 --> 01:25:42,616
..I should get my
daughter married to you?

1834
01:25:43,642 --> 01:25:45,291
I don’t want to praise myself..

1835
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:47,257
..but my talent lies
in my hands, uncle.

1836
01:25:47,258 --> 01:25:48,288
(Indistinct)

1837
01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:51,857
Uncle, I started raising
my hands in college itself.

1838
01:25:51,882 --> 01:25:54,452
I don’t even need a hockey stick.

1839
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:58,731
I thrashed many goons
using these very hands.

1840
01:25:58,773 --> 01:25:59,309
Yes.

1841
01:25:59,448 --> 01:26:01,713
Uncle, all my friends used to say..

1842
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:03,944
..that there are only
two real men in this world.

1843
01:26:04,295 --> 01:26:06,257
One's Sunny Deol and the other, Amardeep.

1844
01:26:06,298 --> 01:26:07,757
That is me.
Okay, uncle?

1845
01:26:07,841 --> 01:26:10,799
Uncle, though I don’t raise my hand much.

1846
01:26:10,839 --> 01:26:12,999
But when I do, oh the way I do!

1847
01:26:13,197 --> 01:26:15,028
Let me tell you what
happened day before yesterday.

1848
01:26:15,053 --> 01:26:19,421
I thrashed a guy so badly that
the poor guy is still in the ICU.

1849
01:26:19,585 --> 01:26:21,382
He's in coma.

1850
01:26:22,404 --> 01:26:24,209
Uncle, power!

1851
01:26:24,269 --> 01:26:26,727
The power of the hands!
Take a look.

1852
01:26:26,919 --> 01:26:29,877
- I just need your blessings, uncle.
- Here you go.

1853
01:26:34,645 --> 01:26:35,874
What did you do?

1854
01:26:36,919 --> 01:26:40,106
People offer milk to a snake,
I am offering him buttermilk.

1855
01:26:47,064 --> 01:26:47,525
Then?

1856
01:26:47,733 --> 01:26:48,538
Then what?

1857
01:26:48,684 --> 01:26:50,912
Papa bathed him in
buttermilk and threw him out.

1858
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:52,476
Oh no!

1859
01:26:58,132 --> 01:27:01,356
Sorry Geet,
but your dad is one piece in the world.

1860
01:27:01,863 --> 01:27:02,631
Only one piece.

1861
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:05,665
Tell me, what are you
doing with the next one?

1862
01:27:05,717 --> 01:27:06,726
Relax, relax.

1863
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,968
Balli bro is handling our this case.

1864
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:10,890
And remember one thing..

1865
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:13,280
It is quite important for Mr.
Bhalla to know..

1866
01:27:13,305 --> 01:27:15,685
..how a man starts his married life.

1867
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,405
Honeymoon.
Make sure you talk about honeymoon.

1868
01:27:24,196 --> 01:27:25,312
Wow uncle, buttermilk!

1869
01:27:25,402 --> 01:27:26,413
I love buttermilk.

1870
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:27,736
If you don’t mind, auntie and uncle..

1871
01:27:27,777 --> 01:27:28,932
..can I just try some buttermilk?

1872
01:27:28,973 --> 01:27:30,194
Sure, why not?

1873
01:27:30,257 --> 01:27:31,103
Thank you.

1874
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,403
- It's from our shop.
- Wonderful.

1875
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:34,241
Amazing.

1876
01:27:34,611 --> 01:27:36,531
Son, what do you plan
to do after the wedding?

1877
01:27:36,594 --> 01:27:37,728
(Indistinct)

1878
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:40,085
I've planned to go to
Switzerland for my honeymoon.

1879
01:27:40,086 --> 01:27:40,578
(bicycles bell )

1880
01:27:40,992 --> 01:27:43,507
We will shop in Dubai for the first
two days. (Airplane Take-off)

1881
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:45,788
After that a chartered
flight to Switzerland.

1882
01:27:47,591 --> 01:27:51,241
But uncle,
if we don’t like the climate there..

1883
01:27:51,704 --> 01:27:52,687
..then we will go to Paris.

1884
01:27:52,741 --> 01:27:53,452
Paris!

1885
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:56,855
- We don’t need to worry since
it is a chartered plane. - Yes.

1886
01:27:57,227 --> 01:27:59,723
I believe in having a great honeymoon.

1887
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:02,593
Uncle, this will be my first honeymoon.

1888
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,460
Is this a first for
your daughter as well?

1889
01:28:04,485 --> 01:28:06,873
(Indistinct.

1890
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:13,802
Hey Mr. Frequent Flyer!

1891
01:28:14,015 --> 01:28:15,810
- What is it, uncle?
- Stand up.

1892
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:17,804
- What happened?
- And get out.

1893
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:20,100
And not hug me before you leave..

1894
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:21,510
I believe in non-violence.

1895
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:26,811
If I get violent then I'll
squeeze you to then when you hug me.

1896
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:29,263
Go, and fly in your plane..

1897
01:28:29,485 --> 01:28:33,017
..and go on a honeymoon with a girl
who has already been on a honeymoon.

1898
01:28:33,252 --> 01:28:34,788
- Get lost!
- Uncle! Uncle!

1899
01:28:34,829 --> 01:28:35,789
- Security!
- Uncle!

1900
01:28:35,831 --> 01:28:37,232
Escort him to his plane.

1901
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:40,536
He wants to go on a
honeymoon with my daughter.

1902
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:41,872
Idiot.

1903
01:28:43,547 --> 01:28:44,821
(Crowd applause)

1904
01:28:46,452 --> 01:28:47,320
(Camera Shutter)

1905
01:28:49,676 --> 01:28:50,251
Dude.

1906
01:28:51,649 --> 01:28:52,609
Hey dude.

1907
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,073
That's it.

1908
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,136
This western "dude" culture
is making the young of our country..

1909
01:28:58,191 --> 01:29:00,266
..stay away from milk
and ghee (clarified butter).

1910
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:02,487
They like burger more than their home.

1911
01:29:02,877 --> 01:29:04,143
They like pizza more
than their brother-in-law.

1912
01:29:04,184 --> 01:29:06,065
And momos more than their uncles.

1913
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:10,165
That's why our company is trying to..

1914
01:29:10,419 --> 01:29:12,531
..keep the youth of country healthy..

1915
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,839
..with milk,
ghee, yogurt and buttermilk.

1916
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:20,597
That's why after Tau Ghee,
soon our company..

1917
01:29:20,794 --> 01:29:22,407
..is also going to
launch Tau buttermilk.

1918
01:29:22,783 --> 01:29:26,011
Because east or west Haryana is the best.

1919
01:29:26,584 --> 01:29:28,339
Its milk and yogurt
are better than the rest.

1920
01:29:29,395 --> 01:29:30,854
Long live our soldiers!

1921
01:29:30,855 --> 01:29:32,799
(Crowd applause)

1922
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:35,511
Thank you.

1923
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:43,599
- Sir! Sir! Sir!
- One picture, sir!

1924
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,905
- K. K. sir! - What's the reason
behind launching Tau Ghee?

1925
01:29:46,179 --> 01:29:47,791
- Please tell us, sir.
- Why Tau Ghee, sir?

1926
01:29:50,146 --> 01:29:53,602
Tau Ghee will soon
be available in the market.

1927
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,366
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Move.

1928
01:29:56,407 --> 01:29:57,599
Come this way, sir. Come.

1929
01:29:58,974 --> 01:30:01,065
Mr. KK! Mr. KK!

1930
01:30:01,284 --> 01:30:02,753
- It's okay.
- Hello.

1931
01:30:03,104 --> 01:30:04,042
Hello.

1932
01:30:04,272 --> 01:30:06,628
First of all, I would like to thank..

1933
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:09,288
- ..for ordering sweets from my shop.
- Yes.

1934
01:30:09,329 --> 01:30:11,815
Secondly,
after listening to your thoughts..

1935
01:30:11,854 --> 01:30:14,119
..I have become a huge fan of yours.

1936
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,273
Thank you.

1937
01:30:15,532 --> 01:30:17,798
You have a great style.

1938
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:18,971
Dude!

1939
01:30:19,351 --> 01:30:20,119
Dude!

1940
01:30:21,185 --> 01:30:24,214
You have a great style and a great heart.

1941
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,339
You are linked to your roots.

1942
01:30:26,364 --> 01:30:28,694
Thank you for your polite words.

1943
01:30:29,112 --> 01:30:31,591
But I don’t think I
have anything special in me.

1944
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:35,112
Being a human being it
is our duty to love each other..

1945
01:30:35,137 --> 01:30:36,228
..and respect our elders.

1946
01:30:36,253 --> 01:30:40,806
What a noble thought!

1947
01:30:40,913 --> 01:30:42,786
Excuse me, I need to leave now.

1948
01:30:42,827 --> 01:30:44,581
I need to attend a mass marriage.

1949
01:30:44,865 --> 01:30:47,697
I have taken up the responsibility
of marrying a few poor couples.

1950
01:30:48,256 --> 01:30:49,294
That's great.

1951
01:30:49,923 --> 01:30:53,150
After hearing this I have
become a double fan of yours.

1952
01:30:54,502 --> 01:30:56,306
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1953
01:31:00,031 --> 01:31:05,522
Goddess, he needs to
be a part of Geet's life.

1954
01:31:05,763 --> 01:31:08,347
- Mamma, I am leaving.
- I'm coming, Geet.

1955
01:31:09,029 --> 01:31:09,758
Okay, bye.

1956
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:10,869
- Bye.
- See you.

1957
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:12,391
Whose bag is that?

1958
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,059
Your papa's.

1959
01:31:13,258 --> 01:31:14,065
He is going with you.

1960
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:16,436
Come on, mamma, doesn’t he trust me?

1961
01:31:16,674 --> 01:31:18,584
(Dog barking)
I am going to attend my friend's wedding.

1962
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:19,162
I know.

1963
01:31:19,203 --> 01:31:21,584
And what will they think.
Their fathers aren't tagging along.

1964
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:24,290
- This is not fair. - Geet, I am not
going with you without a reason.

1965
01:31:24,331 --> 01:31:25,229
(Vehicle Pass by)

1966
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:28,253
Ria's uncle had come
to our shop to invite me.

1967
01:31:28,434 --> 01:31:29,850
He said to come with the whole family..

1968
01:31:29,877 --> 01:31:31,335
..otherwise he won't enjoy the wedding.

1969
01:31:31,376 --> 01:31:33,362
We are anyway not going
to enjoy it now, papa.

1970
01:31:33,565 --> 01:31:35,101
Mamma isn't coming, so why are you?

1971
01:31:35,369 --> 01:31:36,867
I don’t know why she isn't coming.

1972
01:31:36,947 --> 01:31:38,261
I need to mediate on Prabhu's name.

1973
01:31:39,357 --> 01:31:40,470
Mamma, you know, right?

1974
01:31:41,898 --> 01:31:44,151
She has never been to
any wedding other than her own.

1975
01:31:44,267 --> 01:31:45,574
She wouldn't have attended
that either if I wasn’t there. - Mother.

1976
01:31:45,623 --> 01:31:47,120
He's so dramatic. I won't go with him.

1977
01:31:47,161 --> 01:31:47,775
Don’t say that.

1978
01:31:47,825 --> 01:31:49,113
Mamma, who does this?

1979
01:31:49,114 --> 01:31:50,996
(Horn Honking)
Smile and leave, my child.

1980
01:31:51,342 --> 01:31:52,394
Mamma loves you.

1981
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:54,939
(Vehicle Pass by)
Yeah.

1982
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:06,091
"Back off!"

1983
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:09,458
"Back off, uncle!"

1984
01:32:11,656 --> 01:32:13,077
"Back off!"

1985
01:32:13,388 --> 01:32:14,886
"Back off, uncle!"

1986
01:32:15,068 --> 01:32:18,377
"Back off, uncle!"

1987
01:32:18,416 --> 01:32:22,255
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1988
01:32:25,021 --> 01:32:26,480
"I am high.."

1989
01:32:26,781 --> 01:32:28,277
"I am high.."

1990
01:32:28,397 --> 01:32:31,853
"I am high and ready to fly."

1991
01:32:31,895 --> 01:32:35,005
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1992
01:32:35,142 --> 01:32:38,614
"I have no control over myself today."

1993
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:41,725
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1994
01:32:41,832 --> 01:32:44,942
"I will get drunk and dance."

1995
01:32:45,181 --> 01:32:49,458
"Let me get drunk and dance."

1996
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:05,979
"You can invite Shakira."

1997
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:12,714
"You can make us compete."

1998
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:19,564
"You can invite Shakira."

1999
01:33:19,635 --> 01:33:22,253
"You can make us compete."

2000
01:33:22,278 --> 01:33:23,850
"My moves.."

2001
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:25,575
"My moves.."

2002
01:33:25,616 --> 01:33:29,034
"My moves have a lot to say today."

2003
01:33:29,075 --> 01:33:32,531
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2004
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:38,941
"I am high and ready to fly."

2005
01:33:38,982 --> 01:33:42,399
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2006
01:33:42,441 --> 01:33:45,744
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2007
01:33:45,783 --> 01:33:49,284
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2008
01:33:49,489 --> 01:33:50,910
"Back off!"

2009
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,048
"Back off, uncle!"

2010
01:34:02,994 --> 01:34:06,450
"I won't let the music stop."

2011
01:34:09,354 --> 01:34:13,271
"I won't sleep,
I won't let anyone sleep."

2012
01:34:16,353 --> 01:34:19,934
"I won't let the music stop."

2013
01:34:20,045 --> 01:34:22,639
"I won't sleep,
I won't let anyone sleep."

2014
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,370
"I will cause a commotion.."

2015
01:34:24,506 --> 01:34:26,042
"I will cause a commotion.."

2016
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:29,432
"I will cause a commotion
using my emotions."

2017
01:34:29,543 --> 01:34:33,036
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2018
01:34:36,188 --> 01:34:39,720
"I am high and ready to fly."

2019
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,004
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2020
01:34:43,043 --> 01:34:46,230
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2021
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:52,146
"Let me get drunk and dance."

2022
01:34:54,038 --> 01:34:54,729
Veer?

2023
01:34:56,772 --> 01:34:58,244
What are you doing here?

2024
01:34:59,137 --> 01:35:01,016
Papa too is here.
You will get beaten up.

2025
01:35:01,386 --> 01:35:02,346
Go away.

2026
01:35:02,723 --> 01:35:04,401
Why should I fear when you are near?

2027
01:35:04,682 --> 01:35:05,796
Getting cheesy?

2028
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:07,940
You will get beaten
up if papa hears that.

2029
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:09,851
Veer, papa.

2030
01:35:13,129 --> 01:35:14,512
Don’t you have any shame?

2031
01:35:16,225 --> 01:35:18,371
How can you stoop so low?

2032
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,457
- Sir..
- You are a goon.

2033
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:21,150
Papa!

2034
01:35:22,338 --> 01:35:23,836
But even goons have a character.

2035
01:35:23,861 --> 01:35:25,112
You don’t even have a good character.

2036
01:35:26,325 --> 01:35:28,067
I am feeling very angry but..

2037
01:35:28,543 --> 01:35:30,738
..since someone's happiness
and honor are at stake..

2038
01:35:30,763 --> 01:35:32,211
..I have kept a check on myself.

2039
01:35:33,673 --> 01:35:34,288
Let's go, dear.

2040
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:36,288
- Papa, please.
- You won't say a word, Geet.

2041
01:35:37,691 --> 01:35:39,918
You saw what the boy
of your choice can do, right?

2042
01:35:40,178 --> 01:35:41,906
Now you will do as I say.

2043
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,603
I have finalized a very nice boy for you.

2044
01:35:45,602 --> 01:35:47,944
And I know that you
will be very happy with him.

2045
01:35:48,472 --> 01:35:49,143
Papa!

2046
01:35:49,946 --> 01:35:50,713
Let's go.

2047
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,189
(Vehicle Pass by)

2048
01:36:05,263 --> 01:36:06,530
Call up my uncle.

2049
01:36:06,796 --> 01:36:08,024
I need to give him the good news.

2050
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:10,502
'He's an uncle from Haryana,
a philanderer.'

2051
01:36:10,685 --> 01:36:12,950
'He loves English and Englishwomen.'

2052
01:36:13,072 --> 01:36:14,877
'He couldn’t learn English.'

2053
01:36:15,093 --> 01:36:17,857
'But he has thought the Englishwomen
how to speak Haryanvi.'

2054
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:21,006
'Balli knows him quite well.'

2055
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:23,440
'After all, he had sold him a car.'

2056
01:36:23,548 --> 01:36:24,471
I too will go with you.

2057
01:36:24,885 --> 01:36:26,643
What will an old hag like you do there.

2058
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:27,744
What will you do there?

2059
01:36:27,872 --> 01:36:29,331
Young girls will go there.

2060
01:36:29,531 --> 01:36:30,744
Hot chicks.

2061
01:36:30,955 --> 01:36:31,835
Me too.

2062
01:36:31,895 --> 01:36:32,746
Me too.

2063
01:36:32,747 --> 01:36:33,783
(Mobile ringing)

2064
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,324
Yes, nephew?

2065
01:36:37,365 --> 01:36:39,553
- Uncle, your nephew is getting married.
- Married?

2066
01:36:39,609 --> 01:36:40,755
(Indistinct)
Yes.

2067
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:43,541
I think you have finally
ready to bite the apple.

2068
01:36:43,584 --> 01:36:46,494
Do attend my wedding, uncle.

2069
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,294
Of course, I will.

2070
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:50,341
My marriage will be no fun without me.

2071
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:52,596
True. Who will do all the rituals?

2072
01:36:52,845 --> 01:36:54,304
Don’t worry.

2073
01:36:54,988 --> 01:36:57,637
I will come there as soon
I am done with my honeymoon.

2074
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,099
- I will surely be there.
- Okay, uncle.

2075
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:01,807
He is getting married instead
of concentrating on the business.

2076
01:37:04,101 --> 01:37:06,750
Uncle has four wives to entertain him.

2077
01:37:07,301 --> 01:37:09,758
And I have not even been
able to get engaged even once.

2078
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:12,893
We get work according to our status.

2079
01:37:13,192 --> 01:37:14,916
I stay in heaven along with the angels.

2080
01:37:15,419 --> 01:37:17,224
But I am sweeping floors there.

2081
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:21,176
He has given me a gun
and made me a cleaner.

2082
01:37:21,226 --> 01:37:23,104
Uncle, your car is ready.

2083
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:25,296
Let's go if you are done here.

2084
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:29,946
(Mobile ringing)

2085
01:37:37,217 --> 01:37:39,367
Veer! Veer! Veer!

2086
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:40,741
How are you?

2087
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:42,529
Did you like the design of the card?

2088
01:37:43,106 --> 01:37:44,642
I am sure you must have the name.

2089
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,061
I am sure you are well educated.

2090
01:37:48,757 --> 01:37:53,941
So the thing is, I want you
to engrave something in your mind.

2091
01:37:54,504 --> 01:37:57,076
Geet is my fiancée.

2092
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:00,631
If I see you anywhere
close to her henceforth..

2093
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,713
..then no one will
be able see you anymore.

2094
01:38:04,302 --> 01:38:07,797
The thing is, you still quite young.

2095
01:38:08,296 --> 01:38:09,666
You have a long life ahead of you.

2096
01:38:39,783 --> 01:38:40,705
- Hey!
- Veer!

2097
01:38:41,075 --> 01:38:41,996
How dare you come here!

2098
01:38:42,085 --> 01:38:42,738
Security!

2099
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:44,157
Who let him in?

2100
01:38:44,304 --> 01:38:45,733
Sometimes it's the elder
one and sometimes it's the younger.

2101
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:46,827
- Gopi.. Gopi!
- Come on, leave!

2102
01:38:46,933 --> 01:38:48,165
- Get out! Leave!
- Gopi!

2103
01:38:48,347 --> 01:38:49,153
Calm down.

2104
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:50,651
At least hear him out.

2105
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:53,532
You can listen to this goon. I won't.

2106
01:38:55,648 --> 01:38:56,838
Sorry, Veer.

2107
01:39:02,592 --> 01:39:05,237
Sir, you invited me
a lot at that wedding.

2108
01:39:06,251 --> 01:39:08,009
I could have answered
you back if I wanted to.

2109
01:39:09,108 --> 01:39:13,255
But I too was aware that we
were there celebrating someone's joy..

2110
01:39:14,045 --> 01:39:15,812
Someone's honor was at stake.

2111
01:39:19,345 --> 01:39:21,342
I tolerated all your questions.

2112
01:39:22,655 --> 01:39:25,188
And a single reply from
me could have been enough for you.

2113
01:39:29,045 --> 01:39:30,313
May I say something, sir?

2114
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:34,970
I can kidnap Geet whenever I want.

2115
01:39:37,646 --> 01:39:38,837
But I won't do that.

2116
01:39:39,549 --> 01:39:41,321
Because both of us don't want that.

2117
01:39:42,131 --> 01:39:45,203
Because if a father doesn’t
give his daughter away happily..

2118
01:39:45,873 --> 01:39:47,730
..then that relationship
holds no value for us.

2119
01:39:50,472 --> 01:39:51,879
Geet and I won't get
married to each other..

2120
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:55,165
..till we don’t have your permission.

2121
01:40:00,964 --> 01:40:03,000
One more thing, sir.

2122
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,516
That day,
I didn't go there because of Geet.

2123
01:40:07,398 --> 01:40:09,165
It was my friend's brother's wedding.

2124
01:40:10,326 --> 01:40:12,376
I didn’t even know
that Geet could be there.

2125
01:40:12,784 --> 01:40:15,011
I too have a character.
I don’t show up just anywhere.

2126
01:40:18,535 --> 01:40:19,764
It's from your shop.

2127
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,522
(Horse neigh)

2128
01:40:37,535 --> 01:40:38,251
Come, sir.

2129
01:40:38,294 --> 01:40:39,677
These are our horses, sir.

2130
01:40:40,229 --> 01:40:41,419
As white as snow.

2131
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:43,305
All of them are of a good breed, sir.

2132
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:46,580
You won't find a single spot on them.

2133
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:49,093
We have around 50 such
horses in our farmhouse.

2134
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:54,071
You won't get such horses anywhere else.

2135
01:40:55,605 --> 01:41:00,009
Mr. Vinod, not every horse
can handle me on its back.

2136
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:01,241
- Okay.
- Got it?

2137
01:41:01,425 --> 01:41:02,040
Yes.

2138
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:05,136
So, you do one thing..
Get me a horse from Peshawar.

2139
01:41:05,575 --> 01:41:06,458
- Okay.
- Where will you get it from?

2140
01:41:06,525 --> 01:41:07,110
Peshawar.

2141
01:41:09,577 --> 01:41:11,216
(Footsteps) (Car Door opening)

2142
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:24,635
"Who is this in front of me?"

2143
01:41:25,903 --> 01:41:27,400
"My heart skipped a beat."

2144
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:29,664
This is great, Veer.

2145
01:41:30,272 --> 01:41:31,885
You too have come to book a horse?

2146
01:41:33,184 --> 01:41:34,605
Tell me something..

2147
01:41:35,126 --> 01:41:37,430
What will you do with the horse?

2148
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,001
You will tour the city on it?

2149
01:41:41,461 --> 01:41:43,534
You know, people will think
you are crazy and hit you?

2150
01:41:45,426 --> 01:41:48,095
I am taking a horse from
Peshawar to Bhalla's house.

2151
01:41:49,159 --> 01:41:51,134
What will you do, mister?

2152
01:41:58,881 --> 01:42:02,452
You shouldn’t laugh on
a bad joke and mislead people.

2153
01:42:07,008 --> 01:42:10,464
Mr. Groom, you will also
need guests at the wedding.

2154
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:13,422
Teach them some manners.

2155
01:42:14,032 --> 01:42:17,009
Otherwise, there'll be just cripples
accompanying you at the wedding.

2156
01:42:45,264 --> 01:42:46,530
Do you know who I am?

2157
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:49,014
Why are you hitting me?
I have not done anything.

2158
01:42:50,717 --> 01:42:52,296
Juhi, you saw that?

2159
01:42:52,694 --> 01:42:57,435
These animals who look like humans are
spreading violence on the streets.

2160
01:42:57,476 --> 01:42:58,048
Why are you hitting me?

2161
01:42:58,073 --> 01:42:59,631
Can you see how he is hitting him?

2162
01:42:59,813 --> 01:43:01,030
He will hit him even more.

2163
01:43:01,732 --> 01:43:03,384
And he might also kill him.

2164
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,470
Do you know why?

2165
01:43:04,806 --> 01:43:06,611
Because none of them is Veer.

2166
01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:09,789
It is necessary that
every crowd have a Veer..

2167
01:43:10,453 --> 01:43:14,475
..to protect our girls and the weak.

2168
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:25,771
So we got all the permits.

2169
01:43:25,796 --> 01:43:26,522
Yes sir.

2170
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:32,384
- Upload all the files by tomorrow.
- Sure, sir.

2171
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:34,678
Just make sure that you copy that.

2172
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,963
Hey you idiot!

2173
01:43:37,485 --> 01:43:38,560
Uncle!

2174
01:43:38,821 --> 01:43:39,704
That's great!

2175
01:43:40,571 --> 01:43:42,150
Bhurra!
Bhurra!

2176
01:43:42,214 --> 01:43:43,845
Put him down.

2177
01:43:46,786 --> 01:43:47,814
Get the marbles out of your mouth.

2178
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:50,042
Father!

2179
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:52,878
What do you want to be?

2180
01:43:53,089 --> 01:43:53,934
What do you want to be?

2181
01:43:53,959 --> 01:43:54,996
What are you trying to do?

2182
01:43:55,126 --> 01:43:56,163
What are you trying to do?

2183
01:43:56,225 --> 01:43:57,070
Shut up!

2184
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:58,244
Father!

2185
01:44:00,134 --> 01:44:01,463
It has been three months..

2186
01:44:01,623 --> 01:44:04,043
..hence I heard about
any crime committed by you.

2187
01:44:04,133 --> 01:44:05,646
You didn’t steal anything.

2188
01:44:05,671 --> 01:44:06,915
You didn’t do any bank robbery.

2189
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,369
You didn’t kidnap anyone.

2190
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:09,900
And now you are getting married.

2191
01:44:09,927 --> 01:44:12,377
You have also shattered
your mother's dream.

2192
01:44:12,755 --> 01:44:15,103
She wanted you to be greater than Dawood.

2193
01:44:15,307 --> 01:44:16,306
There should be reward over your head.

2194
01:44:16,331 --> 01:44:17,636
You should be wanted across the world.

2195
01:44:17,728 --> 01:44:19,687
And you want to get married, stupid.

2196
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,800
Are you done, uncle?

2197
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:22,880
Now listen to your nephew.

2198
01:44:22,928 --> 01:44:23,543
Come on.

2199
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:25,491
Come on, uncle.
Don’t get angry.

2200
01:44:25,516 --> 01:44:26,515
Come with me.

2201
01:44:27,786 --> 01:44:29,681
Don’t you trust your nephew?

2202
01:44:29,945 --> 01:44:30,705
Huh, uncle?

2203
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,479
You are my uncle.

2204
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:35,275
Mother's brother is like another mother.

2205
01:44:36,012 --> 01:44:38,585
This marriage, it is nothing.

2206
01:44:39,084 --> 01:44:39,939
Then what is it?

2207
01:44:43,316 --> 01:44:46,533
It involve 70 acres of land, uncle.

2208
01:44:46,609 --> 01:44:47,300
How many?

2209
01:44:47,486 --> 01:44:48,758
- 70 acres!
- 70 acres?

2210
01:44:48,783 --> 01:44:49,513
Yes.

2211
01:44:50,298 --> 01:44:52,296
Our project Jagdamba City..

2212
01:44:52,985 --> 01:44:55,097
This piece of land lies
somewhere in the middle.

2213
01:44:55,602 --> 01:44:57,099
Bhalla wasn’t handing it over.

2214
01:44:58,048 --> 01:45:01,123
'Sir, how many times have I told you..'

2215
01:45:01,164 --> 01:45:04,157
'..that forget 70 acres,
I'm not even ready..

2216
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:06,267
..to sell even a small piece of land.'

2217
01:45:07,621 --> 01:45:08,619
But now he will happily give it away.

2218
01:45:08,921 --> 01:45:09,612
How?

2219
01:45:09,653 --> 01:45:12,110
As dowry, along with his daughter.

2220
01:45:12,134 --> 01:45:12,834
Along with his daughter!

2221
01:45:12,859 --> 01:45:13,910
The truth?

2222
01:45:13,935 --> 01:45:16,517
I never lie, uncle.
I swear.

2223
01:45:17,192 --> 01:45:18,798
That's my boy!

2224
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:21,439
Bhurra! Bhurra!

2225
01:45:22,092 --> 01:45:23,321
- Quiet.
- We will get the girl and the land.

2226
01:45:23,362 --> 01:45:25,232
- Don’t act crazy.
- We will get the girl and the land.

2227
01:45:25,257 --> 01:45:28,478
We will get the girl and the land.

2228
01:45:28,584 --> 01:45:32,298
We will get the girl and the land.

2229
01:45:32,369 --> 01:45:33,729
We will get the girl and the land.

2230
01:45:33,754 --> 01:45:35,674
Father, but whose?

2231
01:45:35,732 --> 01:45:36,653
Bhalla's!

2232
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:40,011
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2233
01:45:40,052 --> 01:45:42,564
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2234
01:45:42,611 --> 01:45:44,080
Bhalla! Bhalla! Bhalla!

2235
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:47,705
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2236
01:45:47,928 --> 01:45:51,095
I am Bhalla! I am Bhalla!

2237
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:55,181
I am Bhalla! I am Bhalla!

2238
01:45:55,306 --> 01:45:56,766
I am Bhalla!

2239
01:45:57,013 --> 01:45:58,814
Father, Bhalla!

2240
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:01,376
Yes.

2241
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,478
Gopichand Bhalla.

2242
01:46:04,716 --> 01:46:05,986
Brother, today you have made the slogan..

2243
01:46:06,243 --> 01:46:12,298
..educate the daughter,
save the daughter meaning in my life.

2244
01:46:12,487 --> 01:46:14,983
Look, I educated my daughter.

2245
01:46:15,813 --> 01:46:16,970
And you saved her.

2246
01:46:18,485 --> 01:46:22,440
Bhalla's daughter, Bhalla's land!

2247
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:24,489
Bhalla! Bhalla! Bhalla!

2248
01:46:25,953 --> 01:46:26,931
Goodbye!

2249
01:46:37,523 --> 01:46:38,666
How are you, Mr. Bhalla!

2250
01:46:39,603 --> 01:46:40,550
Thank you.

2251
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:42,578
Thank you?

2252
01:46:43,001 --> 01:46:46,265
You cleared all my doubts.

2253
01:46:47,422 --> 01:46:48,759
I was in a dilemma.

2254
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:51,065
You have cleared all my doubts.

2255
01:46:51,593 --> 01:46:56,491
Now, don’t even think about
getting married to my daughter.

2256
01:46:59,988 --> 01:47:01,679
You won't get married to her.

2257
01:47:02,537 --> 01:47:04,535
Mr. Bhalla, don’t start with this now.

2258
01:47:05,964 --> 01:47:09,291
I am a simple guy,
but I am not prone to shocks either.

2259
01:47:10,111 --> 01:47:12,775
The thing is, everyone
knows that I am getting married.

2260
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:14,752
Only the horse needs to be decorated.

2261
01:47:14,986 --> 01:47:15,982
If my honor..

2262
01:47:16,007 --> 01:47:20,539
It's not your honor,
but my daughter's life at stake here.

2263
01:47:21,183 --> 01:47:23,377
Anyone who tries to
take her happiness away..

2264
01:47:23,826 --> 01:47:25,401
Son, I am confectioner.

2265
01:47:26,576 --> 01:47:27,843
I make sweets.

2266
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:31,103
But that doesn’t mean
I say only sweet things.

2267
01:47:32,211 --> 01:47:37,664
I also know how to start
a fire and fry and roast things.

2268
01:47:38,694 --> 01:47:39,564
Got it?

2269
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:42,790
Goodbye.

2270
01:47:47,915 --> 01:47:54,236
Bhalla, you think you have
a feast after spoiling my meal?

2271
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:57,798
All hail the Goddess, Bhalla!

2272
01:47:58,265 --> 01:47:59,839
Don’t worry, nephew.

2273
01:48:00,147 --> 01:48:01,760
Your uncle is still here.

2274
01:48:01,896 --> 01:48:03,855
You prepare to get married.

2275
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,564
Things will go as your
uncle wants them to go.

2276
01:48:06,756 --> 01:48:10,050
Anyone who interferes will be done for.

2277
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,278
(Horn Honking)

2278
01:48:11,304 --> 01:48:12,306
Sorry, brother.

2279
01:48:13,866 --> 01:48:19,041
I had painted a very
bad image of Veer in my mind.

2280
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,987
He is a very nice boy.

2281
01:48:22,715 --> 01:48:23,790
I am bad.

2282
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,186
Born in '56.

2283
01:48:28,129 --> 01:48:31,509
My old school thoughts and stubbornness..

2284
01:48:32,171 --> 01:48:36,720
..didn't understand her heart,
her love or her understanding.

2285
01:48:37,852 --> 01:48:39,887
I am a very bad father.

2286
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:41,009
Third-class.

2287
01:48:42,132 --> 01:48:44,896
But now I want to become first-class.

2288
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:51,087
Hence, I request you to
please get Veerey married to Geet.

2289
01:48:51,393 --> 01:48:52,353
Accept her.

2290
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,298
I have been feeling
burdened since last night.

2291
01:48:57,177 --> 01:48:58,751
I couldn’t even sleep.

2292
01:49:00,747 --> 01:49:03,819
Mr. Bhalla,
you should unburden yourself.

2293
01:49:04,235 --> 01:49:05,794
I too have done so.

2294
01:49:06,724 --> 01:49:10,189
Today, I realized that
my Veer is a very nice boy.

2295
01:49:15,163 --> 01:49:16,776
Thank you. Thank you.

2296
01:49:17,843 --> 01:49:21,929
"Everyone is happy,
today's Veerey's wedding."

2297
01:49:24,974 --> 01:49:29,103
"Dance, dude.. Today's
Veerey's wedding."

2298
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:33,889
- "Everyone is happy."
- Everything good?

2299
01:49:33,914 --> 01:49:35,672
"Today's Veerey's wedding."

2300
01:49:35,742 --> 01:49:36,966
"Veerey's wedding.."

2301
01:49:37,008 --> 01:49:37,699
Mother.

2302
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,312
"Veerey's wedding.."

2303
01:49:39,523 --> 01:49:42,539
"Veerey's wedding.."

2304
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:51,830
Bhalla!

2305
01:49:52,553 --> 01:49:54,232
Today I will make you a belle!

2306
01:50:00,801 --> 01:50:01,531
Bhurra!

2307
01:50:01,809 --> 01:50:03,000
Go and get Geet.

2308
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:04,994
I'll get her, father.

2309
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:06,483
Why don’t you just kill me?

2310
01:50:06,603 --> 01:50:08,150
I'll get you your wife, bro.

2311
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,432
Geet! Geet! Geet!

2312
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:17,987
Help!
Who are you?

2313
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:18,950
Father!

2314
01:50:19,248 --> 01:50:20,860
- Hey beardy goon, who are you?
- What is it?

2315
01:50:20,901 --> 01:50:22,087
- Father!
- Get me down!

2316
01:50:22,128 --> 01:50:24,240
- Father, I have brought Geet!
- Get me down!

2317
01:50:27,021 --> 01:50:28,384
- Geet!
- I am not Geet!

2318
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:31,552
You idiot, she isn't Geet!

2319
01:50:31,553 --> 01:50:32,542
(Footsteps) (Indistinct chatters)

2320
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:33,978
Slap him!

2321
01:50:35,024 --> 01:50:36,253
Father, I'll go and get Geet.

2322
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:46,542
Uncle, why do you go close to yogurt
when you know you're allergic to it?

2323
01:50:46,584 --> 01:50:49,539
Nephew, I didn’t go close to it.
It came to me.

2324
01:50:50,858 --> 01:50:53,236
- Okay, so it can walk?
- Geet! Geet!

2325
01:50:55,923 --> 01:50:57,681
She is looking so beautiful.

2326
01:50:58,118 --> 01:50:59,308
Just like an angel.

2327
01:50:59,461 --> 01:51:01,173
I don’t feel like disturbing her.

2328
01:51:01,174 --> 01:51:02,018
(Mobile ringing)

2329
01:51:02,019 --> 01:51:02,979
I'm getting a phone call.

2330
01:51:03,601 --> 01:51:06,654
- Oh great, it's brother-in-law!
- Shut up.

2331
01:51:07,626 --> 01:51:08,163
Hello?

2332
01:51:08,432 --> 01:51:09,315
What are you doing, Geet?

2333
01:51:09,624 --> 01:51:10,698
Getting henna applied.

2334
01:51:10,788 --> 01:51:11,211
Great.

2335
01:51:11,466 --> 01:51:12,759
- Can we meet?
- Now?

2336
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,808
Yes.

2337
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,229
- Are you close?
- Very.

2338
01:51:16,304 --> 01:51:17,431
- Come over.
- Okay.

2339
01:51:17,697 --> 01:51:18,762
Come over.

2340
01:51:18,803 --> 01:51:20,147
Count till ten and I will be there.

2341
01:51:20,212 --> 01:51:21,902
- Should I?
- Come over.

2342
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:24,056
Come over, Mr. Groom.

2343
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:28,223
Because this groom
is already with his bride.

2344
01:51:28,592 --> 01:51:32,642
The thing is, if she agree,
then we will get married..

2345
01:51:32,985 --> 01:51:35,481
..and if she doesn't
then I will kidnap her.

2346
01:51:35,925 --> 01:51:40,384
Now let's see whether
I kidnap her or you save her.

2347
01:51:44,113 --> 01:51:46,533
How do girls run wearing
such heavy dresses?

2348
01:51:47,677 --> 01:51:49,416
Catch your sister-in-law!

2349
01:51:49,827 --> 01:51:51,144
Geet!

2350
01:51:53,474 --> 01:51:55,586
Hello. Hello, police?

2351
01:51:55,817 --> 01:52:00,714
Don’t run! Your dress will get ruined.
You will fall into the pool!

2352
01:52:02,063 --> 01:52:05,382
Be careful. Don't hurt her.

2353
01:52:23,626 --> 01:52:24,658
(Indistinct) (Gasping)

2354
01:52:24,659 --> 01:52:25,464
What happened, son?

2355
01:52:25,715 --> 01:52:26,895
Why did you stop?

2356
01:52:28,211 --> 01:52:29,018
Veer?

2357
01:52:29,578 --> 01:52:30,385
You are here?

2358
01:52:30,969 --> 01:52:32,879
Look, Veer is here now.

2359
01:52:34,356 --> 01:52:36,431
Son, we had called the police,
but you showed up.

2360
01:52:36,471 --> 01:52:37,355
God bless you.

2361
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:38,949
You have come at the right time.

2362
01:52:39,663 --> 01:52:40,699
Come on son, go for it.

2363
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:41,691
Violence?

2364
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:43,203
No, no, no!

2365
01:52:43,267 --> 01:52:44,799
I don’t raise my hand on anyone.

2366
01:52:45,146 --> 01:52:46,605
Okay, okay, okay.

2367
01:52:46,728 --> 01:52:47,926
Then what's this?

2368
01:52:47,988 --> 01:52:49,668
This? Broke it with my leg.

2369
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:51,390
- Okay.
- Get him.

2370
01:52:51,451 --> 01:52:53,256
Do you want me to Whatsapp
you the instructions? Get him!

2371
01:52:53,378 --> 01:52:54,184
- Hey!
- Veer!

2372
01:52:55,146 --> 01:52:55,683
Papa!

2373
01:53:02,173 --> 01:53:04,980
"Your beloved is here."

2374
01:53:05,467 --> 01:53:07,041
"And my bride is scared?"

2375
01:53:08,098 --> 01:53:11,439
Father-in-law, you should
prepare for our wedding.

2376
01:53:11,581 --> 01:53:14,346
Because now your daughter is mine.

2377
01:53:14,436 --> 01:53:15,012
Right?

2378
01:53:16,002 --> 01:53:17,918
- She hit me!
- Get her, brother!

2379
01:53:18,073 --> 01:53:18,765
Stop!

2380
01:53:30,168 --> 01:53:30,858
Run!

2381
01:53:40,539 --> 01:53:41,781
Well done, Veer.

2382
01:53:46,325 --> 01:53:47,867
- Elephant!
- Move away!

2383
01:53:48,829 --> 01:53:50,672
Go away!

2384
01:53:56,726 --> 01:53:57,490
Uncle!

2385
01:53:57,699 --> 01:54:00,579
Your nephew is getting
beaten up over there.

2386
01:54:00,679 --> 01:54:01,639
Where are you going?

2387
01:54:01,783 --> 01:54:03,031
You too will get thrashed.

2388
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:05,031
Listen, you like Dahi Bhalla, right?

2389
01:54:05,072 --> 01:54:06,378
So I got some for you.

2390
01:54:06,577 --> 01:54:09,688
Uncle, try some Dahi
Bhalla made by the Bhallas.

2391
01:54:10,563 --> 01:54:12,138
Just eat the dumpling in it.

2392
01:54:12,974 --> 01:54:14,867
Then just eat the yogurt.

2393
01:54:17,051 --> 01:54:19,469
Strange. He likes neither
yogurt nor the dumpling.

2394
01:54:19,685 --> 01:54:20,461
This is great!

2395
01:54:24,096 --> 01:54:24,759
Balli bro?

2396
01:54:25,254 --> 01:54:25,853
Veerey?

2397
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:49,700
Geet! Geet! Geet!

2398
01:54:52,425 --> 01:54:53,270
Father!

2399
01:54:53,901 --> 01:54:55,433
My marbles!

2400
01:54:58,499 --> 01:54:59,261
Uncle?

2401
01:55:00,138 --> 01:55:01,542
Hello!

2402
01:55:03,258 --> 01:55:04,292
What's wrong?

2403
01:55:06,258 --> 01:55:08,754
Come here.
What is it? What's wrong?

2404
01:55:09,853 --> 01:55:10,925
Why are you sneezing?

2405
01:55:18,137 --> 01:55:21,785
Come on, man.
Who is sending the location to you?

2406
01:55:21,871 --> 01:55:22,815
You show up from thin air!

2407
01:55:22,929 --> 01:55:23,986
You!

2408
01:55:38,491 --> 01:55:39,683
Who did put your nose into?

2409
01:55:41,725 --> 01:55:42,685
Wipe it.

2410
01:55:43,107 --> 01:55:43,760
I am feeling better.

2411
01:55:44,043 --> 01:55:44,658
Thank you.

2412
01:55:46,525 --> 01:55:47,869
Calm down, calm down.

2413
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,281
I cannot speak.

2414
01:55:49,612 --> 01:55:51,972
You don’t need to, uncle.

2415
01:55:52,691 --> 01:55:55,417
Fear is visible on your face.

2416
01:55:56,931 --> 01:55:58,620
And why are you holding this gun?

2417
01:55:58,867 --> 01:56:00,134
Why do you need a gun?

2418
01:56:00,172 --> 01:56:01,785
One look at your face
and one will pee out of fear.

2419
01:56:01,885 --> 01:56:03,498
You should have been in the army.

2420
01:56:03,576 --> 01:56:04,304
Or police.

2421
01:56:04,381 --> 01:56:05,917
You should have fought for our country.

2422
01:56:06,269 --> 01:56:08,064
You would have defeated our enemy.

2423
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:10,808
And your nephew, what is his name?

2424
01:56:11,524 --> 01:56:12,753
What has he done for you?

2425
01:56:13,112 --> 01:56:14,571
Has he ever sent you anywhere?

2426
01:56:14,733 --> 01:56:16,000
- He did.
- Where?

2427
01:56:16,417 --> 01:56:17,629
He has sent me to prison, thrice.

2428
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:18,792
Damn him!

2429
01:56:19,219 --> 01:56:21,062
I did so much for him.

2430
01:56:21,347 --> 01:56:22,383
I robbed banks.

2431
01:56:22,424 --> 01:56:23,307
I stole from other people.

2432
01:56:23,389 --> 01:56:24,387
I committed murders.

2433
01:56:24,571 --> 01:56:27,065
I escaped encounters, thrice.
Look at this, a bullet mark.

2434
01:56:27,228 --> 01:56:27,893
Oh no.

2435
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,737
All uncles are generous.

2436
01:56:32,274 --> 01:56:34,041
But even the nephew
should be considerate.

2437
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,882
I will send you to London.

2438
01:56:37,998 --> 01:56:39,917
Everything there will be fair.

2439
01:56:40,669 --> 01:56:42,168
Fair girls.

2440
01:56:43,434 --> 01:56:44,739
Fair boys.

2441
01:56:45,094 --> 01:56:46,901
Uncle! Come back!

2442
01:56:50,086 --> 01:56:52,158
- Come on!
- Let go!

2443
01:56:55,254 --> 01:56:56,290
Let me go!

2444
01:56:56,336 --> 01:56:58,064
- Father!
- Let me go!

2445
01:56:59,269 --> 01:57:01,304
- I brought her!
- Who have you brought?

2446
01:57:01,482 --> 01:57:02,096
Geet!

2447
01:57:02,173 --> 01:57:03,409
I am not Geet, stupid!

2448
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,722
Stop kidnapping girls.

2449
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:13,629
My nephew turned me into an evil man.

2450
01:57:16,014 --> 01:57:19,089
If not for this love, you would
have been a colonel in the army.

2451
01:57:20,013 --> 01:57:20,858
Enough..

2452
01:57:23,256 --> 01:57:24,906
You have opened my ears.

2453
01:57:26,527 --> 01:57:28,409
At least get the saying right, uncle.

2454
01:57:28,746 --> 01:57:29,400
Hey!

2455
01:57:29,859 --> 01:57:30,974
You have opened my eyes.

2456
01:57:44,219 --> 01:57:44,795
Uncle!

2457
01:57:45,157 --> 01:57:45,579
Uncle!

2458
01:57:45,634 --> 01:57:46,363
Has he changed for good?

2459
01:57:56,199 --> 01:57:58,813
Hey!
I am warning you, I'll shoot you!

2460
01:57:58,854 --> 01:57:59,891
Where did I get the umbrella from?

2461
01:58:00,119 --> 01:58:01,040
Here it is!

2462
01:58:01,309 --> 01:58:02,922
I have not loaded it as I was in a hurry.

2463
01:58:02,947 --> 01:58:05,057
But I will hit you with it.
My aim is very good.

2464
01:58:12,408 --> 01:58:14,941
Someone shot me on my bum!

2465
01:58:15,885 --> 01:58:18,611
Call for an ambulance. I will die.

2466
01:58:18,848 --> 01:58:21,611
- Come on, get going from here!
- Good work, Rani Chaudhary.

2467
01:58:21,914 --> 01:58:23,887
- Arrest him!
- Take them away!

2468
01:58:23,928 --> 01:58:25,386
They should manage to escape!
Come on, take them away.

2469
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:29,440
Let's go, scoundrels.
I will get you married in the prison.

2470
01:58:29,533 --> 01:58:30,378
Come on.

2471
01:58:30,999 --> 01:58:31,840
Thank you.

2472
01:58:44,432 --> 01:58:45,201
You..!

2473
01:58:48,234 --> 01:58:48,646
Come on!

2474
01:58:48,733 --> 01:58:49,638
- Geet!
- Let me go!

2475
01:58:52,219 --> 01:58:54,715
Too much attitude, Rani Chaudhary?

2476
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,521
Two slaps and you got impressed?

2477
01:58:59,308 --> 01:59:01,191
I handle half the cases of this city.

2478
01:59:01,757 --> 01:59:04,701
Anyway, whether or not it falls
under my area, SP always send me.

2479
01:59:05,175 --> 01:59:07,505
This falls under my area,
that's why I am here.

2480
01:59:07,872 --> 01:59:10,170
I am sure you must be dying to praise me.

2481
01:59:10,388 --> 01:59:11,271
But I don’t have time to waste.

2482
01:59:11,549 --> 01:59:12,163
Hey!

2483
01:59:23,787 --> 01:59:24,623
Save him!

2484
01:59:24,726 --> 01:59:25,379
Veer!

2485
01:59:26,328 --> 01:59:28,976
Don’t let go of my hand, I will die!
I am telling the truth, I will fall.

2486
01:59:29,017 --> 01:59:30,394
I am telling the truth.

2487
01:59:30,435 --> 01:59:31,011
Don’t let go!

2488
01:59:31,088 --> 01:59:31,818
Uncle!

2489
01:59:31,885 --> 01:59:32,313
Bro.

2490
01:59:32,354 --> 01:59:33,816
- Should I let you go?
- No, no, no.

2491
01:59:33,891 --> 01:59:34,621
- No, please.
- Should I?

2492
01:59:34,698 --> 01:59:36,554
Please, don’t let go
of my hand at any cost!

2493
01:59:36,579 --> 01:59:38,154
- Uncle!
- Veer, don't!

2494
01:59:38,207 --> 01:59:39,497
I am telling the truth.

2495
01:59:39,956 --> 01:59:43,325
This is what's called humanity.
This boy is full of it.

2496
01:59:43,514 --> 01:59:45,664
From today,
I stop all my illicit businesses.

2497
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:48,497
I have learnt a lesson.
If you fall down..

2498
01:59:48,522 --> 01:59:49,635
If he lets go of your hand..

2499
01:59:49,726 --> 01:59:51,070
Then you will die for sure.

2500
01:59:51,148 --> 01:59:53,415
This boy deserves to be with Geet.

2501
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:54,554
He deserves her!

2502
01:59:55,048 --> 01:59:55,892
Bro! Bro! Bro!

2503
01:59:55,933 --> 01:59:57,507
I am totally getting
what uncle is trying to say.

2504
01:59:57,563 --> 01:59:58,446
I am telling the truth.

2505
01:59:58,488 --> 01:59:59,302
You can have Geet.

2506
01:59:59,427 --> 02:00:01,501
You can have the 70 acres of land too.
You can have Geet's father.

2507
02:00:01,542 --> 02:00:02,502
You can have meet too, bro.

2508
02:00:02,675 --> 02:00:03,558
You should get married, bro.

2509
02:00:03,612 --> 02:00:05,648
I will dance at your wedding.
I swear.

2510
02:00:05,689 --> 02:00:06,534
Please pull me up, bro.

2511
02:00:07,837 --> 02:00:08,490
Look..

2512
02:00:10,141 --> 02:00:12,829
The thing is that I
just got impressed by you.

2513
02:00:14,006 --> 02:00:16,041
So, I am thinking of taking a chance.

2514
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:19,742
If you try to act
smart then you know that..

2515
02:00:20,709 --> 02:00:21,745
That's enough, Mr. Balli.

2516
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:24,317
How hard are you going
to make me fall for you?

2517
02:00:24,933 --> 02:00:27,389
Rani Chaudhary is
already crazy about you.

2518
02:00:27,414 --> 02:00:29,356
I will dance at your wedding!

2519
02:00:29,381 --> 02:00:30,278
Veer!

2520
02:00:30,452 --> 02:00:33,692
I think you should switch
back to non-violence now.

2521
02:00:33,721 --> 02:00:34,292
Come on.

2522
02:00:34,333 --> 02:00:35,600
Let go of everything.

2523
02:00:35,648 --> 02:00:38,490
- Should I let go?
- No, don’t let go!

2524
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:40,974
- No, don’t let go!
- He will fall!

2525
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:42,950
Pull him up!
Pull him up, bro!

2526
02:00:42,991 --> 02:00:45,371
- Don’t let go, please!
- Pull him up!

2527
02:00:45,658 --> 02:00:46,659
Very good.

2528
02:00:47,403 --> 02:00:48,489
What are your intentions?

2529
02:00:50,132 --> 02:00:51,207
To get married.

2530
02:00:52,796 --> 02:00:53,871
That's your decision?

2531
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:54,579
Yes.

2532
02:00:54,821 --> 02:00:56,549
Is your decision considered
the final decision in your house?

2533
02:00:56,621 --> 02:00:57,120
Yes.

2534
02:00:57,547 --> 02:00:59,046
Do you have any Tillu in your life?

2535
02:00:59,088 --> 02:00:59,509
Yes.

2536
02:01:00,706 --> 02:01:01,589
Tillu?

2537
02:01:02,508 --> 02:01:03,200
No.

2538
02:01:04,421 --> 02:01:06,533
Balli bro!

2539
02:01:07,281 --> 02:01:08,583
She agreed!

2540
02:01:08,778 --> 02:01:11,075
'Finally Balli found his queen, Rani.'

2541
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:13,005
'Veerey got married to Geet.'

2542
02:01:13,194 --> 02:01:16,278
'And the ones who danced
the most at the wedding were..'

2543
02:01:16,725 --> 02:01:17,544
'Uncle..'

2544
02:01:18,231 --> 02:01:19,267
'And his nephew!'

2545
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:30,338
"Into our lives,
happiness has made a smooth landing."

2546
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:35,386
"Sister-in-law looks like an angel.."

2547
02:01:35,432 --> 02:01:37,467
"Bro looks like a king."

2548
02:01:40,441 --> 02:01:44,344
"When the groom will
get ready and look dashing.."

2549
02:01:44,385 --> 02:01:47,841
"When the groom will
get ready and look dashing.."

2550
02:01:48,003 --> 02:01:50,806
"All the guests will start dancing."

2551
02:01:50,847 --> 02:01:54,341
"Then all the guests
will start dancing."

2552
02:02:09,268 --> 02:02:10,958
"Dance will continue nonstop.."

2553
02:02:11,058 --> 02:02:12,747
"Nonstop for a month."

2554
02:02:12,801 --> 02:02:14,491
"Uncle will dance.."

2555
02:02:14,568 --> 02:02:16,525
"So will the idiot
who stands no chance."

2556
02:02:19,636 --> 02:02:21,595
"Dance will continue nonstop.."

2557
02:02:21,636 --> 02:02:23,364
"Nonstop for a month."

2558
02:02:23,405 --> 02:02:25,056
"Uncle will dance.."

2559
02:02:25,097 --> 02:02:26,979
"So will the idiot
who stands no chance."

2560
02:02:27,068 --> 02:02:30,524
"Even the drums won't stop rocking."

2561
02:02:30,618 --> 02:02:33,421
"Even the drums won't stop rocking."

2562
02:02:35,558 --> 02:02:38,688
"All the guests will start dancing."

2563
02:02:38,728 --> 02:02:42,807
"Then all the guests
will start dancing."

2564
02:02:49,817 --> 02:02:53,465
"If you don’t know to dance,
just move your hips.."

2565
02:02:53,604 --> 02:02:56,907
"Let this party become a hit!"

2566
02:03:00,494 --> 02:03:03,988
"If you don’t know to dance,
just move your hips.."

2567
02:03:04,257 --> 02:03:07,521
"Let this party become a hit!"

2568
02:03:07,704 --> 02:03:10,930
"Even the DJ said I ain't stopping!"

2569
02:03:11,275 --> 02:03:14,424
"Even the DJ said I ain't stopping!"

2570
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:19,425
"All the guests will start dancing."

2571
02:03:19,502 --> 02:03:22,958
"Then all the guests
will start dancing."

2572
02:03:23,495 --> 02:03:26,912
"It is time to celebrate,
I am so happy!"

2573
02:03:27,024 --> 02:03:30,096
"Move away, girl, get out of my way."

2574
02:03:30,136 --> 02:03:33,669
"Let me swirl as
I have got a chance..."

2575
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:35,205
"Today at Veerey's.."

2576
02:03:35,282 --> 02:03:37,010
"Today at Veerey's.."

2577
02:03:37,051 --> 02:03:40,773
"Today at Veerey's wedding,
let me dance."

2578
02:03:40,814 --> 02:03:42,273
"Today at Veerey's.."

2579
02:03:44,568 --> 02:03:48,290
"Everyone is happy,
today's Veerey's wedding."

2580
02:03:48,347 --> 02:03:51,496
"Veerey's wedding.."

2581
02:03:51,681 --> 02:03:55,291
"Dance, dude.. Today's
Veerey's wedding."

2582
02:03:55,444 --> 02:03:58,593
"Veerey's wedding.."

2583
02:03:58,634 --> 02:04:02,433
"They make a cute couple,
it's my bro's wedding!"

2584
02:04:02,474 --> 02:04:05,968
"Veerey's wedding.."

2585
02:04:06,073 --> 02:04:09,529
"Everyone is happy,
today's Veerey's wedding."

2586
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:12,834
"Veerey's wedding.."

02:04:13,132 --> 02:04:16,396
"Veerey's wedding.."

2588
02:04:16,437 --> 02:04:20,270
"Veerey's wedding.."
