1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500


2
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,208
Come in.

3
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,916
What was so urgent?

4
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,833
Inder, get some water.

5
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,833
You could have come in the morning?

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,458
Shahid...

7
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,041
Shahid...

8
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,041
Shahid...

9
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,500
By showing me injustice, He taught me to love justice.

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,500
What does it mean?

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,333
I don't understand English well.

12
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:22,500
By showing me injustice..

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,666
..God taught me about justice.

14
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,166
By inflicting pain and suffering..

15
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,875
..he gave me the courage to fight.

16
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:33,541
He taught me to help the helpless

17
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:38,208
A criminal has no religion.

18
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,833
Eventually both the killer and his victim are human.

19
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,875
Right?

20
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,875
Did I say too much?

21
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:55,208
Never forget this

22
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,833
(Voice on walkie-talkie) Come in. Kill "those" bastards.

23
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,833
I haven't had any sleep. Kill the bastards.

24
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,083
Mother, where's my shirt?

25
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,250
It's right there

26
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,125
I can't find it

27
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,458
look carefully, son

28
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,500
Press it like this and take it out this way.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Done that.

30
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,791
Where you going?

31
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,375
Shahid, where are you going?

32
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,125
Coming.

33
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,291
Shahid, where are you going son?

34
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,291
Coming mother

35
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,875
Where is Shahid?

36
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,875
Shahid?

37
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,666
Open up. It's Shahid.

38
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,666
Brother Shahid...

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,291
Mother, open the door.

40
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,333
Brother.

41
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,791
Open up. It's Shahid.

42
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,041
I think it's Shahid.

43
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,250
Open the door, brother.

44
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,625
Please let me in.

45
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,041
Mother, it is Shahid.

46
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,041
Get out of the way.

47
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,666
Why did you go out?

48
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,541
Why did he go out?

49
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,166
Everything's been set ablaze.

50
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,125
They are killing women, children..

51
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,125
They will destroy everything.

52
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,291
Are you alright?

53
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,291
Okay. Be quiet.

54
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:55,041
"Without any care, the colour has started to drain away"

55
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,500
"Rather than living like a slave..."

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:07,500
"I feel detached and dismayed"

57
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,708
"I can't express my condition"

58
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:17,541
"I'll get sacrificed surely"

59
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:22,916
"Life seems to have gotten angry with me"

60
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:29,375
"My heart-beats are now like smoke"

61
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:39,500
"I don't see any solution..."

62
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,625
"...nor do I see a direction, to head towards my destination."

63
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,625
"Allah o Akbar."

64
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,833
"Allah o Akbar."

65
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,875
Kill him. Slit his throat.

66
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,208
Kill him.

67
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,666
"Allah o Akbar."

68
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,750
Shahid, stop.

69
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,916
Shahid.

70
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,500
Shahid.

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,375
"Love has slipped away"

72
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:30,916
"There isn't any care remaining"

73
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,916
"My heart just remains a assembly of thoughts."

74
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,708
Mother, Shahid is back

75
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,791
Shahid, what took you so long son?

76
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,083
We've been waiting

77
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,208
What about your exams?

78
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,083
Are you prepared, son?

79
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,000
Come on, freshen up. - Let me talk to him.

80
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,083
He just returned from our village let him freshen up first.

81
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:03,083
Let him rest for a while. He has returned after a long time.

82
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,000
Shut up!

83
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,000
I haven't told them where you were.

84
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,625
Shahid, switch off the lights. I can't sleep.

85
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,625
Shahid, switch off the lights.

86
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,291
Just a minute.

87
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,416
Switch it off.

88
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,916
Did we ask you to stay this long in the village?

89
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,916
Quiet. I have work in the morning.

90
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,041
Now study.

91
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,041
I can't even sleep peacefully now.

92
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,541
Shahid, what is this? Switch off the light.

93
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,833
He's switching on the light.

94
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,916
Shut up all of you. Go to sleep. Stop creating a ruckus.

95
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,958
Shahid, switch off the light.

96
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,625
Just a little while longer. - Shahid, do it now.

97
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,333
Ask him to turn off the light.

98
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,625
Where are your manners?

99
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,375
I am going out.

100
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,958
Go to sleep!

101
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,958
Driving me insane.

102
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,333
Just shut up and come with us. - I've done nothing sir. Honestly

103
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,166
My son has done nothing, sir. He has a job.

104
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,500
What do you need to know from him?

105
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,458
We just want to question him.

106
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,666
Get out of the way

107
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,833
Shahid, they are taking your brother away.

108
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:57,958
Who the hell are you now?

109
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:58,916
Shahid, move aside.

110
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,458
You are Shahid?

111
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,583
Leave that guy. Take this one in. He is our man.

112
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,500
He hasn't done anything wrong.

113
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,333
Get in the fucking car!

114
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,333
Shahid.

115
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,208
What are you staring at?

116
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,208
Come on let's go home.

117
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,958
Tell me now motherfucker.

118
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:34,875
Sit straight and stop crying.

119
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:41,208
3 terrorists. You don't recognize them?

120
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,375
Him?

121
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:50,708
Did a cat get your tongue?

122
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,125
Don't you recognize him?

123
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,458
I've done nothing, sir. I swear.

124
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,666
We found your phone number..

125
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,250
..in his fucking diary.

126
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,541
How does he have your number?

127
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,541
Why not ask him, sir. I've done nothing.

128
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,750
You thick skinned pig!

129
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,583
Tell me.

130
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:30,541
I swear I've done nothing sir

131
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:34,541
I really don't know.

132
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,541
Please, I haven't done anything.

133
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,333
Sir.

134
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,625
Sir.

135
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,208
Excuse me, sir.

136
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:15,083
Sir, I am Arif.

137
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,458
Sit down, why are you standing?

138
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,541
Thank you, sir.

139
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,833
Sir, actually I wanted a meeting

140
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,583
With whom? - With Shahid. My brother

141
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,166
Stand up.

142
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:33,166
Can't you hear me? Stand up.

143
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,333
He is no longer your brother.

144
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,666
He's now an enemy of the country.

145
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,583
Do you know what the anti-terrorism act is?

146
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,583
Sir, I went to Arthur Road jail.

147
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,791
Where have you come from?

148
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,958
Where do you live?

149
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,541
Sir, Bombay.

150
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,750
It's almost 6.

151
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,583
Take the next train to Bombay.

152
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,333
Come back in another 6 months

153
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,000
6 months? I've been coming everyday..

154
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,916
.. for several weeks without an answer.

155
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,625
Are you doing us a favor by coming here?

156
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,833
We didn't tell your brother to join the terrorists.

157
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,125
Sir, he is not a terrorist...

158
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:20,125
Don't show off by speaking in English.

159
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,166
Why are you swearing at me?

160
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm trying to be respectful.

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,250
All I want is to meet my brother

162
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,750
Just get the fuck out of here Get out now!

163
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,541
What do you mean get out?

164
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,541
Get the fuck out of here.

165
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,916

This is your only chance. Sign it

174
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,541
How is Shahid?

175
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,000
He is fine, mother

176
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,125
Do they still trouble him?

177
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,958
No.

178
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,708
Do they still torture him?

179
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,708
He is absolutely fine.

180
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Tell me.

181
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,708
Keep moving.

182
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,041
Come on.

183
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,708
Keep moving.

184
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,083
Hurry up...quickly.

185
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:37,416
Keep moving ahead. We're already behind schedule.

186
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,333
Keep moving.

187
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,500
Keep moving.

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,583
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

189
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,166
What happened?

190
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,375
Can't you hold on to your fast for even 30 days?

191
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,375
What kind of Muslims are you?

192
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,500
Eating like gluttons when you should be fasting..

193
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,500
..and you call yourselves Muslim

194
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,791
Stop staring. Stuff your faces!

195
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,875
Greetings

196
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,333
Greetings

197
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm Omar Sheikh

198
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,500
I know. I've heard about you

199
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,416
What's your name?

200
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,416
Shahid

201
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,291
You are really quiet...

202
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,541
I'm sorry about the other day

203
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,250
I tend to lose it during the Ramzan.

204
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,333
Firstly, you're starving...

205
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,333
..and then you see your brethren hog before you

206
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,416
What can they do? The jail doesn't

207
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,416
allow them to follow the Ramzan routine

208
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,666
Do you play chess?

209
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:15,916
I do.

210
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,666
So then let's play.

211
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,541
When? Now? - Then when?

212
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,541
Let's go. Come.

213
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,583
I'm getting out of here

214
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,250
I'm getting out of here

215
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,250
But your term is much longer?

216
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,916
They will do anything to get me out of here

217
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:49,041
Hijack a plane, take people hostage, anything

218
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:54,375
For whom? You or Masood?

219
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,041
Come with me.

220
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,333
Look at me.

221
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,541
Look at me, Shahid.

222
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:03,833
What?

223
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,625
What do you think? Will you ever get out of this place?

224
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,541
When?

225
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,291
Tell me, when? - No idea.

226
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,291
No idea?

227
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:23,750
Arif, stop visiting me

228
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,541
You are wasting your time

229
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,458
What do you mean?

230
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,291
It's pointless.

231
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,791
It's a waste of time.

232
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,125
I'm trying to get you out, Shahid

233
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,416
I grow weak every time I see you.

234
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,250
I won't survive this if you come again.

235
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,041
Don't come back again

236
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,041
Take care

237
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,375
So the 'Jihadi' likes to read?

238
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,250
What was that?

239
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,250
Come again, what did you say?

240
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,083
What do you know about me?

241
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:20,541
Birds of the same feather, flock together..

242
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,083
What flock?

243
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:27,583
The ones you play football with.

244
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:28,625
They are my friends.

245
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,125
They are nobody's friends..

246
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:35,583
They are smart people.

247
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,708
First, they will give you a political lecture.

248
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,666
Then they will use you.

249
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,958
They believe they're far superior to you.

250
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,666
I'm aware of Omar's oratory skills

251
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,541
He speaks well.

252
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,708
So what if he speaks well?

253
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,333
Omar knows Kabul has more than just horses.

254
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,833
This is a bad book.

255
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:58,916
Meaning?

256
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:03,291
It's simple. Gather all the asses around

257
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:08,041
and you automatically end up as their leader.

258
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,958
How are you such an expert?

259
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,125
Because I know the story of one such ass.

260
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,291
Who?

261
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,916
Me.

262
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,583
Greetings, sir.

263
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:23,750
Bless you.

264
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,125
This is Dr. Saxena.

265
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,000
A professor at Punjab University

266
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,083
Now let me introduce him.

267
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,041
He's a great guy.

268
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,000
He is Gulam Nabi War

269
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,583
He is opening a civil services institute in Kashmir

270
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,458
Especially for the poor

271
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,541
I am helping him with his project

272
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,458
If you want to change the system...

273
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,083
...be a part of it.

274
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:49,083
Sir.

275
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:56,500
War's father owned a carpet factory

276
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,500
But all businessmen had to pay a protection tax to the terrorists

277
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,166
War refused to pay once and they had him framed.

278
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,833
And now he's serving time.

279
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:14,416
He is quite a short-tempered man.

280
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:18,416
His father died two months ago.

281
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:27,541
How can they just throw people in jail without reason?

282
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,416
How far have you studied, Shahid?

283
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:36,208
I was preparing for my college's second year exam...

284
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,208
Shahid, you should study further

285
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,125
Sir, welcome.

286
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,166
Tired?

287
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,083
No, no..

288
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:02,083
Hello.

289
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,833
What?

290
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:06,875
I want to study

291
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,083
So what's stopping you?

292
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,458
The warden won't let me

293
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,458
I will talk to the warden

294
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,208
Now what's the problem?

295
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:24,083
Nothing, just..

296
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,166
Money?

297
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,416
I don't want to ask my family

298
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,708
I will pay your fees

299
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,500
No...

300
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,291
Fine. Sacrifice your education

301
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,041
for your silly self-respect

302
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,416
No. It's not that.

303
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:41,541
I will return the money

304
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:42,583
That's what I am saying.

305
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:43,583
Return it when you can

306
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,583
Yes. I will - This isn't charity. It's a loan

307
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,708
There is a condition

308
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:58,708
You have to stop meeting Omar and his donkeys

309
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,750
But I don't know anyone here

310
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,291
Why? You don't know us?

311
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,833
I do...

312
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,875
Ok, meet them on Sunday

313
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,958
Over a game of chess, only!

314
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,333
Don't get brainwashed

315
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,041
Nah.

316
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:18,458
You're too smart for them

317
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:19,916
Why don't you join the game?

318
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,541
No. Go ahead enjoy yourself

319
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,625
Thank you.

320
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,958
He is a bright kid

321
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,791
No matter which country's history

322
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,333
you are reading..

323
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:37,500
..there's one thing you should understand clearly.

324
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,416
It is not only about wars, conquests and battlefields.

325
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:47,666
It's much more than that

326
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,708
In fact, while studying history...

327
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,041
Beat the Mogul Empire, And banished them out of the empire.

328
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,625
And take over.

329
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,500
Within 5 years time...

330
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,291
...this man turned out to be the most remarkable king of India.

331
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,000
Sher Shah Suri.

332
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,000
You guessed it right.

333
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,541
Understanding of the final aspects of life.

334
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,375
Are very deep.

335
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,750
Just see how simply he says...

336
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,833
...the way he looked before and after...

337
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:47,833
...and time for...

338
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,250
It's amazing.

339
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,125
How simply, how honestly...

340
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,625
...and how precisely.

341
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,916
He has put a thought...

342
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,750
...that we all understand

343
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,750
But nobody has had the words to... Express...

344
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,750
It's only Percy...

345
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:15,250
No, no...

346
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,208
No, please.

347
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:23,208
Take it.

348
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:29,000
Dr. Saxena always says..

349
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,541
...that it's difficult to swim against the tide

350
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,166
But if you manage to do it...

351
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:39,166
You may find a shore that nobody has ever seen

352
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,416
Make the most of this time, my friend

353
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,750
Study hard

354
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,750
You won't even realize how time will fly

355
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,750
Just study

356
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,166
I maybe leaving this jail,

357
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,125
but I'm still with you

358
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,541
I'll see you again

359
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,541
Thank you

360
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,166
It is obvious that principles of natural justice have been..

361
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,958
violated in the State v/s Shahid Azmi case.

362
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,666
Shahid is hereby honorably acquitted..

363
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:48,541
and the court apologizes to Shahid and his family..

364
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:52,750
for the inconvenience caused.

365
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,750
It takes time, but it works

366
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,958
Indian Judicial.

367
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:09,416
It works.

368
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,416
Stop here.

369
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,958
This is home now. How is it?

370
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:27,625
We are on the first floor

371
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,000
It's made of concrete.

372
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,708
Come on.

373
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,958
Mother, the door bell

374
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:40,958
Answer it

375
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,000
Khalid.

376
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,000
He is all grown up now.

377
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,666
Mother, the milkman is here

378
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,833
Coming

379
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,833
Chandu, can't make yoghurt from the milk these days

380
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,375
How are you?

381
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:40,375
I'm okay.

382
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,208
Where do you roam around all day?

383
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:52,833
Where do you go?

384
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,583
Looking for jobs.

385
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,708
Job? He wants to do a job

386
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:03,750
Study. No comprises on study.

387
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,791
Brother, I want to study law

388
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,875
I've filled the form.

389
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,583
Why are you getting involved with the law again?

390
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:14,708
This is what I want to do

391
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,041
If you want to study, then study

392
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:18,791
You can't study and work simultaneously

393
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,500
Do one thing at a time

394
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,500
Mother, I will manage

395
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,666
Mother. Yes.

396
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,916
Mother, my first salary.

397
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:47,791
You keep it son.

398
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,125
You will need it.

399
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:53,125
I have enough. - No mother, keep it.

400
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,125
Do well, my son.

401
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,625
Bless you.

402
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,666
What's for dinner?

403
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,250
What do you want?

404
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,750
Will you make Biryani?

405
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,833
Okay.

406
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,250
Is Arif home?

407
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,250
Yes.

408
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:38,250
I've got a job

409
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,166
With lawyer Maqbool Menon

410
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,791
Good

411
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:47,125
I would have to leave the job that I'm doing..

412
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,291
So?

413
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:53,916
..but they will pay less.

414
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:57,916
How much?

415
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:03,083
Rupees 1200 only

416
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,583
How will we manage?

417
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,583
No worries, I have a plan

418
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,791
Please sign on the first and last paper.

419
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,208
Excuse me. Yes.

420
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:30,666
I have a meeting with Mr. Menon

421
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,541
What time?

422
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,416
4 pm.

423
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:38,416
Please take a seat

424
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,416
Mr. Galaadari, how long have you been working here?

425
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,166
7-8 years?

426
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,791
The judge will throw this file on your face.

427
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,541
And all of you handle civil cases, right?

428
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,666
Just like civil cases..

429
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,708
..that rot for years in old dusty cupboards..

430
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,750
..your brains too have begun to rot.

431
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,458
Look at this pencil

432
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:19,541
Blunt and small like all of you

433
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,541
Nobody ever bothers to sharpen it!

434
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,666
Your English is pathetic

435
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:29,666
How can you be practicing in High Court?

436
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:33,666
You guys deserve to be in the Lower Courts

437
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,000
Get out of here!

438
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,000
Get out of here!

439
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:49,625
Where can I meet Gaffar?

440
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,666
Gaffar.

441
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,125
I have come from Menon's office

442
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,375
Where is Menon?

443
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,041
He's busy

444
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:58,208
Who are you?

445
00:34:58,708 --> 00:34:59,291
I'm Shahid

446
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:00,750
So?

447
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,708
He can't come. He has sent me instead

448
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,333
Do you know who you are talking to?

449
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:07,416
Yes, I know

450
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,666
You have stolen 20 cars from Bombay.

451
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,958
While stealing your last car, you also assaulted the owner.

452
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:17,125
He has lost an eye

453
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,666
Now whatever you have to say, tell me

454
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,375
Can we sit and talk?

455
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:25,291
I will speak to Menon, you go

456
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,291
Abdul, remember his face.

457
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,583
Maryam? - Yes

458
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,833
I'm Shahid, from Menon's office

459
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,291
Tell me

460
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,416
You have a hearing next week

461
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:17,250
So you are here for the fees?

462
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,958
No...

463
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,541
Sir asked me to...

464
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,041
I have seen enough lawyers

465
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,625
More than you can imagine

466
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,666
I could not arrange the fees

467
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:32,333
I can part with a percentage after selling my property

468
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:37,041
Sir wanted the money before the hearing

469
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,750
Please leave then

470
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,750
But...

471
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,916
I said, leave...

472
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,208
I can talk to him if you want...If you need..

473
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,500
No sorry, I don't need any help.

474
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,125
Please. Leave. No.

475
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:08,083
How do we make money, Shahid.

476
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,958
Cases

477
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:12,666
Gaffar?

478
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,750
I met him, he's lying

479
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,333
I know

480
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,833
First he needs to trust you...

481
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,708
..then you will begin to trust him

482
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,291
It takes time

483
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:29,541
I know sir, but...

484
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,750
Police is right. he is guilty

485
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,416
I know

486
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,666
Then why are we defending him?

487
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,416
Because he is a client

488
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:42,333
It's an open and shut case. If we know he is guilty, then..

489
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:45,958
You want me to teach you law again?

490
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,125
What do we do first?

491
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:49,250
We collect the facts..

492
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,583
We collect the facts..

493
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:55,250
..then we manipulate and present it the way we want

494
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,541
The more you waste your time on these books..

495
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,666
Son, you will lose all cases that you fight

496
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,208
And witnesses?

497
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,083
Huh?

498
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,541
What witnesses?

499
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,958
Witnesses are all hostile now

500
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:13,500
All in the palm of my hand

501
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,833
What is this?

502
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,958
Sir, please appoint someone else for this case.

503
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:23,208
You came to my office begging for work

504
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,708
"I want to fight criminal cases!"

505
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,791
"I want to fight criminal cases!"

506
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:32,333
Nobody cherry picks cases in my office

507
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:36,333
Get out

508
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:46,583
What's happening at your end?

509
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,625
The world chases only money

510
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,625
I did not become a lawyer for money

511
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,541
I'm thinking of starting my own practice

512
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,708
There is a little cost involved, but not that much

513
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:13,708
I already have two loans to repay

514
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,500
Okay, I'll apply for another loan

515
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,583
Don't worry, start your practice.

516
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,625
When do you want to start?

517
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,083
I'll get the license tomorrow.

518
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:31,083
Oh! So you applied already?

519
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,541
Hello, Maryam!

520
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:03,875
Maryam! This is Shahid, remember? from Menon's office

521
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:07,333
Oh no, not for that

522
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:11,125
I have started my own practice

523
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,125
Yes.

524
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,875
Have you hired another lawyer?

525
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,875
How do we manage the house expenses?

526
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:16,958
Please don't cry

527
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,458
Shahid?

528
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm Maryam

529
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,833
Please wait

530
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,333
Don't worry, case is in your favor

531
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,333
Okay. Okay.

532
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:36,208
Please come

533
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:40,375
Sorry to keep you waiting

534
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:41,708
Tea or water?

535
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,041
Nothing, thank you

536
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,625
Inder!

537
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:45,916
Go get some water

538
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:50,166
And get some tea as well

539
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:51,375
Property dispute case, right?

540
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,291
Yes

541
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,791
Please tell me a little about your case

542
00:40:56,291 --> 00:41:00,958
My step mother has challenged my father's will in the court

543
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,125
My father had left me a house in Mumbai

544
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:04,125
She is now claiming it

545
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,791
Your step mother?

546
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,541
Have some water. - Thank you.

547
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,166
Is this the file?

548
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes.

549
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,541
I don't have anything else apart from this house

550
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:18,916
Don't worry

551
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,958
This is your house and it will remain yours

552
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,291
Right?

553
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,250
And your fees?

554
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,541
It's ok. Not that important

555
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,083
You must tell me

556
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,958
Whatever you feel is right

557
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:35,000
There is a thing in our lawyer's code of ethics

558
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,416
What?

559
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:41,583
First we win the property from your enemies..

560
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,583
..and then keep it for ourselves

561
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:47,375
Then you will have to hire another lawyer to reclaim the property from us.

562
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,583
I've never heard of this before.. - It was a joke

563
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:53,583
Sorry, bad joke.

564
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,708
Shahid.

565
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:09,541
Phone.

566
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,375
Yes, mother.

567
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,291
I'm in office.

568
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,291
Yes, I am coming.

569
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,833
Greetings.

570
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,916
He is Zaheer's child.

571
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,916
He hasn't seen his father yet.

572
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:46,750
Go to uncle.

573
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,083
What's his name?

574
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,916
Asgar.

575
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:53,125
Asgar.

576
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,041
Asgar.

577
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,958
You're going to meet your father soon.

578
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,958
So be it.

579
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,750
Partition has caused loss to many.

580
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,416
Especially Muslims.

581
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:14,041
We're suffering in India..

582
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,625
..Pakistan and in Bangladesh too.

583
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:20,500
Yes, we all are suffering due to mistakes done by few.

584
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,916
What to do?

585
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:24,791
Well, remember I told you about Zaheer.

586
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,541
The one who was accused of Ghatkopar blasts? - Yes.

587
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,416
He's a software engineer.

588
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:32,208
He's completely innocent.

589
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:34,000
Did you meet his family?

590
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,291
Yes, I've done all the research from my side.

591
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:37,000
He's completely innocent.

592
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,916
I'm sure that we will win this case.

593
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,791
God willing.

594
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,125
Your fees?

595
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,666
Don't worry about that.

596
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,666
Only for official needs.

597
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,583
Yes, that we will give.

598
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,541
I was asking because..

599
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:55,666
..our finances come through donations.

600
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,250
During the month of Ramzan..

601
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,166
..we visit people's homes.

602
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,083
And the donation given to us by them are then used..

603
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,625
..to run the 'Jamaat', so I hope you understand.

604
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,625
No, don't you worry about the fees.

605
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,291
Zaheer, tell me everything you know

606
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,916
Don't try to lie or hide anything from me

607
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:24,625
If I find out later that you did...

608
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,083
I will drop your case

609
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:31,083
Tell me everything.

610
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:38,000
I have done nothing wrong

611
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,083
I just made a small mistake

612
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:45,083
I gave my laptop.. - I know that

613
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,291
It's been over 18 months

614
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,083
I'm beaten up everyday

615
00:44:54,583 --> 00:45:01,666
Everyday I'm treated like a fleabag

616
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:06,833
No value for human rights here

617
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,000
You visited my house..

618
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,208
Do you think I am a terrorist?

619
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:19,208
Public Prosecutor, you can continue.

620
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:27,416
Zaheer This laptop...

621
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,458
Whose laptop is this?

622
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:32,666
Tell us whose laptop it is..

623
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,958
Who is the owner?

624
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:37,083
It's mine

625
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:39,291
Your laptop?

626
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:41,333
Who did you give it to?

627
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,583
Reply quickly!

628
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:46,583
To my friend

629
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:55,000
So you didn't know what your friend was using the laptop for?

630
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,333
No, I didn't know

631
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,125
You gave him your laptop..

632
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,000
But you didn't know what he was doing with it?

633
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,333
Prosecution is trying to lead my client..

634
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:04,916
..when he has said that he does not know

635
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,708
How can he not know? He said That he gave it to his friend

636
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:13,291
Your honor, the laptop was being used to send letters..

637
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:16,666
..for a banned organization

638
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:20,541
This is all unsubstantiated

639
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:23,166
The laptop was with his friend when they found the videos.

640
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,916
This does not have to be proved

641
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,333
Why not?

642
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:31,083
Please... you're doing contempt of Court.

643
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,416
What was inside the laptop..

644
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:38,125
..patronizing Jihad, Gujarat riot videos, inciting messages

645
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,208
It was not my client's, But of his friend who used it

646
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,541
It was his friend who used.. - If the prosecution..

647
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:46,791
..the laptop for all this - ..is saying the same thing

648
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,250
..then what is the case about?

649
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,041
Please, you are a senior

650
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:53,416
Do you want to ask something else?

651
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:54,416
No.

652
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:55,500
Thank you.

653
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,625
Thanks.

654
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:57,708
You...please continue.

655
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,791
Zaheer you gave the laptop to your friend?

656
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,333
Your honor, may I?

657
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:03,750
Please. - Thank you.

658
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,375
You gave the laptop to your friend, Enamul?

659
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:07,250
Yes.

660
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,916
Why?

661
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,500
His computer had crashed and he needed it

662
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,250
You have a computer repair shop too

663
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,916
Why did you not repair it instead of giving your laptop?

664
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:22,833
He needed a computer urgently

665
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:26,291
If he needed a computer he could have gone to a cyber cafe

666
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:29,458
Laptop is not a cycle that can be given to anyone who asks for it.

667
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:31,208
They are childhood friends

668
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:36,000
They are childhood friends - How long have you known each other?

669
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,625
since we were about 5 years old

670
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:39,958
Since they were 5 years old...

671
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,708
How can he not know? They have known each other since they were 5!

672
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:45,750
If a childhood friend asks for your camera..

673
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,083
..pen or mobile won't you give it to him?

674
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:51,083
I will, but I will know what he might do with it

675
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:52,166
They're bound to do everything together.

676
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:55,750
Mr. More, you are a senior lawyer, please sit down

677
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,541
Your honour, you have been asking me to stay quiet..

678
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:58,791
..just because I'm a senior

679
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:01,000
This is a contempt of Court.

680
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,791
Please... - This is...

681
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:06,208
A childhood friend comes to my house..

682
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,583
..and asks if he can stay in my house for two three days

683
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,375
Will I not let him stay in my house?

684
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,291
If he keeps a bomb in my house how will I know?

685
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,083
If the bomb is found in your house..

686
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:20,416
..then evidence is against both of you

687
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:21,666
You're just as guilty.

688
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,041
For a minor error of judgment my client has been languishing in jail

689
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:26,041
You were just leading the friendship issue.

690
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:30,041
Don't you know your childhood friend inside out?

691
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:35,916
I just remembered something...

692
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:37,250
Where's the need to get angry?

693
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,833
You are not making any sense..

694
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,250
Tell me one thing, wouldn't you know your friend?

695
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,250
Especially if you had known him since you were 5?

696
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,083
I understand.. I have childhood friends too..

697
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,166
Show me what's in it? - Nothing.

698
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,541
I can see a sandwich, give me some.

699
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,625
Give it.

700
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:59,208
Mr. Prosecutor, I hope you realize...

701
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:02,000
...you're on a slippery ground.

702
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,125
Police is investigating. it takes time

703
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,000
For the last 1.5 years they have been investigating

704
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,291
Please finish your investigation soon

705
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:13,083
And now we request bail. - Bail denied.

706
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,958
My client is ready to give an undertaking..

707
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:15,958
..that he will not leave the city

708
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:17,083
Next hearing 24th.

709
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,875
Please reconsider. No.

710
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,666
What good's an undertaking?

711
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:24,166
Witnesses can turn hostile

712
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:28,166
He can kill someone or get killed.

713
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:41,125
Don't worry the verdict will be in our favour

714
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:45,583
I don't understand the verbiage you use inside the court room

715
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,708
I don't know if it's in our favor or not

716
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:51,458
A lot of people don't understand it

717
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:53,166
But I am telling you.

718
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:56,583
The judgment should be out soon

719
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:57,708
It will be in our favor

720
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,458
In a month?

721
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:02,083
Maximum of three months

722
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,458
Ok

723
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:04,750
Are you in a hurry?

724
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,625
Just wanted to sell the property and go back to Delhi

725
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:13,583
Why? - I want to start a school there and teach children

726
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:14,666
You can open a school here..

727
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:17,000
.. there are kids here too who want to study

728
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,708
They also need good teachers

729
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,291
You want me to stay here?

730
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:23,541
It's not like that?

731
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:25,833
Are you married?

732
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:31,125
Because I'm your lawyer and I should know everything about you

733
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:32,875
Is the judge going to ask this question?

734
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,750
No, I'm asking

735
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm not married

736
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,666
It's ok, don't answer

737
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,541
But are you married?

738
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,541
You ask too many questions

739
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:48,541
That's my profession

740
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,250
Hello

741
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:50,500
Hello

742
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,708
Maryam?

743
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:54,916
Who is this Maryam? This is Ramanathan.

744
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:56,666
Ramanathan.

745
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:59,458
So, you started your practice without telling me

746
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,000
It's not even started

747
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,916
By the way, who is this Maryam?

748
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:06,250
Just a client

749
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:07,500
Tell me.

750
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,500
Client.

751
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,750
Hello.

752
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,958
Hello.

753
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:29,541
Yes, speaking

754
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,166
Drop Zaheer's case immediately.

755
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:33,250
Who's this?

756
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,666
Your father!

757
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:36,875
Drop the case, you motherfucker..

758
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:40,125
..or you will be sorry that you were born.

759
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,625
Where are you calling from?

760
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,875
Doesn't matter where.

761
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,458
Next time I won't call you.

762
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:50,458
I'll kill you.

763
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:05,666
A gangster threatened me.

764
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,083
What?

765
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,500
Over the phone

766
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,416
Why?

767
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:14,291
Don't know, they were saying..

768
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,250
..that you have to step back from Maryam's case

769
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,083
My case? - Do you have any relatives like that?

770
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,458
I don't know anybody like that

771
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:22,958
No

772
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:25,166
But somebody did threaten me

773
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:29,708
They want me to back out from another case

774
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,000
What do I do?

775
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,833
What does your family say?

776
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,750
I haven't told them

777
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,750
And you're telling me.

778
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:39,958
Why?

779
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,375
Please tell me what to do?

780
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,250
Okay.

781
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,041
I think you should not back down

782
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,875
Why?

783
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:52,833
Because you're right and they are not.

784
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:57,416
Yeah!

785
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,083
I knew you were going to say that

786
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,666
Really? How?

787
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:05,666
Because, I think the same

788
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:10,416
New evidence submitted in the court..

789
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:13,041
..has the confession statements from Altaf Ahmed Imran Qureshi.

790
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,208
The police charge sheet states that Zaheer..

791
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,041
..was involved with them in the conspiracy.

792
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,916
Their statements clearly states that..

793
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:21,458
..they just knew Zaheer and he was not a part of the plan.

794
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:22,708
Prosecution.

795
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,750
We are waiting for the external affairs ministry..

796
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,500
..until they confirm that the mobile number is not Zaheer's..

797
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,625
..we can't corroborate the other evidence in court..

798
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:32,583
How much time will it take?

799
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,416
Ministry of external affairs, time frame is difficult to ascertain

800
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,375
Your honor, we request bail.

801
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:38,875
Bail denied. Please reconsider.

802
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,083
Noted

803
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,625
This is between ministries this might take a lot of time

804
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:46,291
He is a father who hasn't seen his child since its birth

805
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:47,916
Bail denied. We request...

806
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,458
Mr. Council...

807
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:54,458
Evidence is against... - Please approach the bench.

808
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,375
Mr. Shahid.

809
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,458
Sometimes you have to let go.

810
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,750
Your honor, with all due respect... All I am saying is...

811
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,125
They don't have any proof against my client.

812
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,916
They are deliberately delaying the verdict, while my client suffers.

813
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:16,875
What we are doing is completely legitimate, how can you say that?

814
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,000
We are following the procedure.

815
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,791
I am not saying that they are not within their rights..

816
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:25,833
..when you arrest someone under the act, at least have a timeframe..

817
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,416
..you can't keep an innocent behind bars for 10 years like this.

818
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,208
Police is well within it's right.. - It's not about the police...

819
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:33,375
After 15 years even if you free someone, what's the point?

820
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,000
This law is national necessity, Mr. Shahid.

821
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,333
I know...I know.

822
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:40,416
Sir, delaying justice is denying justice

823
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:41,833
We're here to serve the law.

824
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,541
I am not questioning the law, sir.. Please.

825
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,291
All I am saying is... - Mr. Shahid.

826
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:48,208
Just look at him... - Please, you can go now.

827
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:49,416
Both of you.

828
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:52,375
Next hearing.

829
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:56,166
Mr. Ahmad Sheikh and Apurva.

830
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:59,208
Hello, brother Aslam

831
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,666
I have an important favor to ask

832
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:05,416
You have a link in the UAE external affairs ministry, right?

833
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:09,416
I have to get a fax to the Indian Ministry

834
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:16,500
Please get this done

835
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,583
Somebody will bless you for the rest of his life

836
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,208
Bail denied for the 9th time

837
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:27,958
When they have nothing all they can do is delay things

838
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:30,500
How much time do you think?

839
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,375
A month, maybe more. I don't know

840
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:36,625
You can see that I am trying

841
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,833
You heard the judge telling prosecution that day

842
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,500
"You are on slippery ground"

843
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,750
Our case is strong Zaheer

844
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,083
All they talk about is the Gujarat riots video

845
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:51,541
What about history channel videos, educational videos?

846
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,000
Mom and dad's pictures.

847
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,000
It's their case and they will show what they want, the way they want.

848
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,166
What did I say earlier?

849
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,041
What did I say earlier?

850
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:07,375
It takes time but...

851
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:11,375
It will happen.

852
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,000
This is from the external affairs ministry..

853
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,750
..and it's been confirmed by Dubai Ministry.

854
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,750
And it states that, the mobile number's..

855
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,000
..registered user which the prosecution keeps talking about..

856
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,000
.. as vital evidence belonged to Khwaja Yunus and not my client.

857
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,125
It's all there. Prosecution. Yes, sir.

858
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,041
I am not aware of this

859
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:47,083
And under the Indian Evidence act, this evidence is not admissible.

860
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:49,791
This is primary evidence. Prosecution has been waiting for this

861
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:51,416
We haven't had time to review it.

862
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,041
You were saying that the mobile number had come from Dubai.

863
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:53,958
Here is your confirmation

864
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:55,791
Does not matter whether it comes from Dubai,Kuwait or Iraq

865
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,666
It has just arrived and we need time.

866
00:57:58,166 --> 00:57:59,833
Prosecutor, if you have to directly say anything please do..

867
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,041
..or I am moving ahead

868
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:03,541
There's a similar case, you can have a look.

869
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:05,500
We need some time.

870
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,083
The Dubai ministry has confirmed that the number is not my client's.

871
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,250
It can be any ministry, how does it matter?

872
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,541
Prosecution, every case has its own facets

873
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,833
It is relevant under the Indian Evidence Act 1872..

874
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,416
and I will admit this evidence

875
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:20,750
Thank you so much, your honor.

876
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,666
But we need some time to cross-examine' No, thank you.

877
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,750
Thank you very much. Next hearing, 4th of August.

878
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,708
4th August. Thank you. Excuse me.

879
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:32,708
Next hearing.

880
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:40,500
Thank you, brother Shahid.

881
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,750
How long will they keep saying bail denied.

882
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,750
Someday they will have to say 'not guilty'.

883
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,250
Have you tried the 'Biryani' here?

884
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:53,291
No

885
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:54,500
It's very good

886
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,500
Really? then I will have to try it

887
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,833
Do you want to try it? - Now?

888
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:02,000
Not now - We can go for dinner today, tomorrow, whenever you want

889
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,000
Tomorrow?

890
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:03,958
Tomorrow? - Yes.

891
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,041
Not today?

892
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,583
No, I'm busy today

893
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,083
I know you are very busy

894
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:09,583
Now that I've won the case because of you

895
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:13,083
I've got a lot to do!

896
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,916
Without you I would've been visiting one lawyer's office to another.

897
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:19,833
Oh! One minute

898
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,416
It's just a small token.

899
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:24,500
I will pay you the rest after selling my property.

900
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I can't take this, please take it back

901
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,500
But this is for you I will take it when I need it

902
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,791
This is just a part payment - That's why I am not taking it!

903
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,166
I will take it when I need it

904
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:38,166
Ok

905
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,250
I'll call you back in a bit.

906
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,625
Maryam, I want to marry you

907
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,500
What?

908
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,708
I want to marry you

909
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:01,541
I really like you.

910
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:06,750
I know it's not the right place to propose but...

911
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,541
You do know that I am a divorcee

912
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:10,458
And that I have a child

913
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:11,958
Yeah, I know. So?

914
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:14,166
So?

915
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:18,416
Maryam, I want to marry you

916
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:23,000
Excuse me. Bill please.

917
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,500
What happened?

918
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,916
Your fees..

919
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,416
Maryam. Coffee bill.

920
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:31,583
Maryam.

921
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:34,083
Kid, look after my bag.

922
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:38,083
Maryam.

923
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:15,166
What happened?

924
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:16,875
Why is everyone awake?

925
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:21,291
We were waiting for you

926
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,083
If I would have known I would have informed you

927
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:28,083
Who is that girl?

928
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,708
Which girl?

929
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:32,416
You don't know?

930
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,791
Brother, we know everything

931
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:38,125
Who is she?

932
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:39,916
There is no one

933
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,791
The same girl with you on the beach

934
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,541
Khalid told us.

935
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:50,000
Speak up. Who is she?

936
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,291
Maryam

937
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:56,125
Your success has gone to your head

938
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,166
Why do you go to her house?

939
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,791
Let me ask, who is she?

940
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:02,500
Why do you go?

941
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,458
Say.

942
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:08,666
She is my wife

943
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,208
I told you that he is having a scene!

944
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:15,041
Stop talking like a ruffian

945
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,875
Why are we hearing this from others?

946
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:19,541
Why didn't you tell us?

947
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:23,541
Do we mean nothing to you?

948
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,541
I was about to tell you

949
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,708
But then I was scared..

950
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,708
..then she wanted to leave so...

951
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:38,500
It's ok mother, a bride will only help you

952
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,166
She is a nice girl

953
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:43,875
Are you happy?

954
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:48,291
If you keep glaring at me what can I say?

955
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:52,291
Are you happy?

956
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,875
Yes.

957
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:02,208
I want to meet her

958
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,750
Maryam

959
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,041
Maryam

960
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:12,458
So early? All ok? No work?

961
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,125
I won't care even if I have to die, if I am allowed to be your love slave

962
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:17,250
Get ready, quick.

963
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,500
Wear this. - Mother wants to meet you.

964
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,250
Mother.

965
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,500
You told her?

966
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,541
Yes

967
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:31,625
Now go quickly get dressed

968
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,083
Shahid.

969
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:34,791
What's this?

970
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:35,750
What?

971
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,208
Burqa?

972
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,750
Yes

973
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,833
You want me to wear it?

974
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:48,125
Have you ever seen me wearing a burqa?

975
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:49,708
Just for today

976
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:53,291
Did you ask me? - Just for today please

977
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:54,041
Please.

978
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:55,666
Am I not looking good?

979
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,541
You look beautiful

980
01:04:58,041 --> 01:04:59,500
Please, go.

981
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,458
Did you tell them about Sameer?

982
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:05,083
I will

983
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:06,791
I just told them about you

984
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:08,625
After some time I'll tell them about Sameer.

985
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:11,541
Give me some time.

986
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:16,500
But right now we don't have time. Stop arguing with me

987
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,833
I am going to make you wear this

988
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:26,333
Tariq, Arif and the informer - Khalid

989
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:27,791
He smokes a lot

990
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,791
I quit a long time back

991
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,583
Weren't you smoking the other day?

992
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:33,125
Tariq, wasn't he with Rahul that day?

993
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:34,666
No, that wasn't me - Mother

994
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:39,291
He got the most beating when he was a kid.

995
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,125
Mother, this is Maryam

996
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:42,833
Greetings.

997
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,333
How are you?

998
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:45,666
I am good

999
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:49,666
Please sit

1000
01:05:56,916 --> 01:06:01,375
I have asked Khalid to look for a bigger house

1001
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,333
Not necessary

1002
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:07,875
He will stay with me

1003
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:15,416
I was also thinking about this...

1004
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:18,166
It's up to you, son

1005
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:22,375
I did not decide your marriage

1006
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:26,708
How can I decide where you will live?

1007
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:27,833
I'll get some tea

1008
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:31,833
I'll get it. Sit.

1009
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,458
Arif, I have to get somewhere

1010
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,875
It's ready - We will get late

1011
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:54,583
If you have to leave then go ahead

1012
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,250
Ok, mother, I'll leave.

1013
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,333
I'll drop her on the way

1014
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:03,333
Ok.

1015
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,541
Why did you have to say it today?

1016
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:22,791
You were meeting her for the first time

1017
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,750
I don't want any compromise with my son

1018
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,041
What kind of compromise?

1019
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:30,875
He won't get a decent upbringing in that home..

1020
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:33,708
..neither will he be able to concentrate on his studies.

1021
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:36,208
Look at me! Even I cannot live like this.

1022
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:40,208
Even we grew up and studied in that home.

1023
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,500
Maryam.

1024
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,041
We will take another house

1025
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:08,708
But in the same colony

1026
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:12,708
Will that do?

1027
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,250
Okay.

1028
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:17,875
Maryam.

1029
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:19,541
Let's go out for dinner today?

1030
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:21,541
Yes, of course. Let's celebrate.

1031
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,875
Let's do something

1032
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:26,875
Will you come along?

1033
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,666
Come on.

1034
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:32,666
I'll just finish my tea and come.

1035
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:42,500
I have just filed a petition for it

1036
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,500
We must get this lake cleaned up

1037
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,500
This has to be done.

1038
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:57,833
What happened?

1039
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:02,541
Are you angry with me?

1040
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:04,458
What happened?

1041
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:07,041
What do I say?

1042
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:10,125
Your life is settled now that you are married

1043
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:13,500
And as usual I'll look after the family

1044
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,833
Shahid, I'm really tired

1045
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,166
You asked me to think about my life, didn't you?

1046
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:22,666
When should I think about myself?

1047
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:23,916
It's not like that.

1048
01:09:24,416 --> 01:09:27,125
Then how is it? How?

1049
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:29,541
Don't worry, it's not a problem..

1050
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,416
And if you have any problems, come to me

1051
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:33,333
I will help you.

1052
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:37,333
Brother Arif.

1053
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:53,125
Prosecution.

1054
01:09:55,625 --> 01:10:00,458
Your honor, prosecution maintains that Zaheer Shaikh...

1055
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:03,375
..should remain behind bars

1056
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:09,458
Defense wants us to see his face, the face of his new born

1057
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:11,708
Yes, we should

1058
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,041
But let's not forget the faces of the blast victims..

1059
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:18,083
..and their family members too..

1060
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:19,458
Your honor...

1061
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:23,000
This case is going on under the State Terrorism Act..

1062
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,916
..he is a prime suspect and this is not a small matter

1063
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:28,708
This is a question of National Security...

1064
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,125
..this man should remain behind bars.

1065
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:39,875
We should give our agencies more time for investigation

1066
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:46,583
Zaheer Shaikh can be a very dangerous man.

1067
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:50,625
That's all. Thanks.

1068
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:54,625
Defense.

1069
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:08,833
Zaheer has been in jail for the last 2.5 years

1070
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,708
His bail plea has been rejected over 10 times

1071
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:12,916
The police have been unable..

1072
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:16,708
..to get any substantial evidence against him in this period.

1073
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:20,958
Prosecution always mentions about ongoing investigations..

1074
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,958
..without proving anything Zaheer has been labeled a terrorist.

1075
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,916
Not only by them, but the world too..

1076
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:32,083
..without any concrete proof

1077
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:35,250
He is Zaheer's father.

1078
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,500
He lost his job of 30 years in a minute

1079
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,750
Why?

1080
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:44,541
Because, police arrested his son for being a suspected terrorist

1081
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:48,583
Is prosecution of the opinion that Islam and liberalism can't be one?

1082
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,541
Or is Zaheer punished because his name is Zaheer?

1083
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,541
Not Matthew, Donald, Suresh or More.

1084
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:59,541
Is he still in jail just because of his name?

1085
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:06,000
If the investigation drags along for 10 years..

1086
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,708
..will Zaheer languish like this for 10 years?

1087
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:12,333
After 10 years even if he is acquitted what will he do?

1088
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,583
Who will give him a job?

1089
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:20,541
He will be known as a terrorist for the rest of his life.

1090
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:22,500
Prosecution says he is a dangerous man.

1091
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,708
Why is he dangerous?

1092
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:24,875
What has he done?

1093
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:29,208
Because he made a wrong choice in giving his laptop to a friend?

1094
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:32,500
Many innocents have lost their lives in the blasts...

1095
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,166
I sympathize with them completely

1096
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:40,000
But then you can't penalize an innocent man for that.

1097
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,583
I request the court to deliver its verdict today

1098
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:45,750
It's already been delayed a lot.

1099
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,750
Prosecution has no valid reason to detain Zaheer any more

1100
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:14,791
For the last 2.5 years Zaheer has been in jail because of this act

1101
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:20,166
The court admits that the common man at times..

1102
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:25,833
..faces great hardship because of it

1103
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:28,500
But Defence...

1104
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,541
This act is very important..

1105
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:36,250
..for the safety of this country

1106
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,833
Prosecution has not provided the court with any concrete evidence..

1107
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:44,416
..which proves that Zaheer Shaikh is guilty

1108
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:48,833
Therefore, this court in State Vs. Zaheer Shaikh..

1109
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:52,833
..gives Zaheer Sheikh an honorable discharge, not guilty

1110
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:21,708
Journalists will be outside just give simple answers

1111
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,583
How do you feel?

1112
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:24,958
I'm still dazed

1113
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:27,791
Despite being innocent you were in jail for so many months.

1114
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:29,375
Your thoughts?

1115
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:30,291
No.

1116
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:32,791
Do you want the state to apologize to you?

1117
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:36,125
Apology sounds good. But here it won't work

1118
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:36,791
Why?

1119
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:40,250
When you haven't seen your only child since he was born

1120
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,750
What is the point of an apology?

1121
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:42,916
Mr. Shahid, your comments?

1122
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:44,875
Terrorism is a reality that the whole world is facing right now

1123
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,375
I am dead against it.

1124
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:49,166
But then you can't put an innocent man behind bars..

1125
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:51,291
..just because he has no means to defend himself

1126
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,916
I am not saying that, all those arrested by the police are innocent

1127
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:55,416
What about those...

1128
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:59,125
..who lose precious years of their lives imprisoned for no reason.

1129
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,375
I am against that.

1130
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,541
Are you going to file a defamatory case?

1131
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:03,958
Where were all of you till today?

1132
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,958
I don't want to do anything - No more questions please...thanks

1133
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,250
Brother Shahid.

1134
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:34,958
Brother Shahid.

1135
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:38,541
He wanted to thank you.

1136
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:42,541
Come inside. Please come inside.

1137
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,791
Have some tea.

1138
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,208
I already did

1139
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:04,208
Have some more.

1140
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,625
(Voice on News Channels) The blast took place..

1141
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:21,000
at the most important landmark of Mumbai..

1142
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,000
..Gateway of India

1143
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:43,875
Seven blasts in seven locations...

1144
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:14,375
I am so sorry.

1145
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:23,166
Is Sameer asleep?

1146
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:40,166
So sorry, got held up

1147
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:02,625
(Voice on News Channels) 26/11 Attacks on Mumbai Landmarks..

1148
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:06,666
Mumbai will not be the same city it used to be.

1149
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:10,666
There are more than 100 deaths reported.

1150
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:21,250
That female American officer

1151
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:25,250
She felt me up all night

1152
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:31,916
While my hands were tied

1153
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,916
She showed me pornography

1154
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,375
And then..

1155
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:45,750
..touched her menstrual blood...

1156
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:51,125
My God will never forgive me

1157
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:55,250
They won't let me out of here

1158
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:59,250
They won't let me out of here

1159
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,416
Hello.

1160
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:34,750
Do you think you're Gandhi?

1161
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,583
Jihaadi's Gandhi.

1162
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,458
Who is this?

1163
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:41,041
You fight for Jihaadis, asshole.

1164
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,416
Obviously, only a terrorist can empathize with another.

1165
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,208
Bloody traitor.

1166
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:47,875
You're very patriotic?

1167
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,625
You want to kill me?

1168
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,500
You'll die on the streets like a dog, motherfucker.

1169
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,875
Go ahead kill me.

1170
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,166
I won't become a traitor because you say so

1171
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,041
I know what you did in Kashmir.

1172
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:00,958
I know it all. I know what you did in jail too.

1173
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:02,416
People should know too.

1174
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:05,333
Do what you have to and so will I.

1175
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,458
You can threaten me as much as you like

1176
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,333
You will die like a dog, motherfucker.

1177
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:14,333
Kill me

1178
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:21,166
Police has found some kind of a map..

1179
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:22,958
..from the terrorist's dead body.

1180
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:24,916
And they started hunting for the accused in different jails..

1181
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:26,625
..and caught Faheem Khan.

1182
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,541
His only fault was when he was arrested..

1183
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:30,416
..he also had a map.

1184
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:32,083
Why will Zaheer make a map for the terrorist?

1185
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,666
Why will he make such a mistake?

1186
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:35,041
Especially when he is in jail?

1187
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:37,166
They should at least think before arresting someone.

1188
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,291
It's an open and shut case.

1189
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:41,666
It looks a little precarious.

1190
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:42,916
You're confident and sure of it?

1191
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:45,791
Of course I am. Otherwise I wouldn't have asked you.

1192
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:48,916
If we don't defend him they will hang an innocent man.

1193
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:51,000
And what about the phone calls you were getting...

1194
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,666
..did you find out who's behind them?

1195
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:57,958
No, I don't know. - Didn't the police help?

1196
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:01,750
No, I've stopped thinking about it.

1197
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:07,458
I'm really concerned about your well being.

1198
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,875
Take care of yourself.

1199
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,875
I'm fine. I'll be okay.

1200
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,666
Public Prosecutor.

1201
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:28,541
Faheem Khan is accused of providing maps to terrorists...

1202
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:33,625
..for the target locations of the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai

1203
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:39,208
That attack had a devastating impact on all of us

1204
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:47,791
Not just public places, the common man feels unsafe at home too

1205
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:53,541
Our laws deem death penalty as the most severe punishment

1206
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,958
But my request to the court today is that..

1207
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:57,916
..Faheem and his ilk are awarded a penalty..

1208
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,916
..that is even more severe than death..

1209
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:04,583
..so that nobody ever dares to commit such a heinous crime again.

1210
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:07,000
That's all your honor.

1211
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,000
Defense.

1212
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:17,541
These terror attacks have claimed many innocent lives

1213
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:21,541
Many people have lost their near and dear ones

1214
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,958
This is very tragic

1215
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:28,291
All of us watched these disturbing images on TV for over 3 days

1216
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:31,541
These images will remain forever etched in our conscience

1217
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:34,791
The total death toll in this attack is 164

1218
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:38,875
164 innocent people lost their lives

1219
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:40,375
And if what the prosecution wants..

1220
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:41,416
..without any corroborative evidence

1221
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:42,750
If that happens...

1222
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,000
Then this toll will rise to 165..

1223
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,208
..and the 165th innocent man will be Faheem Khan.

1224
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,541
Why does it always happen that anything of this magnitude..

1225
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:57,250
..attracts imprisonment for an ordinary man.

1226
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,375
And the case lingers on..

1227
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:03,750
..while the real culprits might be celebrating somewhere far away..

1228
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:08,875
..drinking in AC rooms and planning future attacks

1229
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:11,000
Why can't the Police ever reach them?

1230
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,291
Why do they almost always never end up standing here?

1231
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:15,750
Why do we always see a helpless man standing here

1232
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,541
One who does not have the ability to fight back

1233
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:24,041
Prosecution does not have any evidence to prove that Faheem is guilty

1234
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,791
But we have strong reasons to believe..

1235
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,625
..that forget death penalty or anything more severe

1236
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:32,791
He should not be here at all

1237
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:35,666
Thank you.

1238
01:23:36,166 --> 01:23:38,083
Please tell the court your name

1239
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,541
Swapnil Mazgaonkar

1240
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:41,833
What do you do?

1241
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:45,375
I run a computer institute in Jogeshwari

1242
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:48,416
In Jogeshwari? - Yes.

1243
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:51,750
Do you know this man?

1244
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,208
Yes, he studied at my institute

1245
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:57,541
What name do you know him by?

1246
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:59,708
Sahil Pavaskar

1247
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:04,291
When does a person need to change his identity?

1248
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:08,416
When he is depressed or is running from his past - I object.

1249
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:10,125
But in this case..

1250
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:11,541
She is raking up his past.

1251
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:14,375
This case is about 26/11. Not about my client's past.

1252
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:17,416
Sir every case is about someone's past.

1253
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,166
Sir, defense is just trying to obstruct me.

1254
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,541
This point is baseless.

1255
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:22,000
Defense, objection over-ruled.

1256
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,458
Thank you, sir.

1257
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:27,541
In 2007 Faheem Khan came to Mumbai..

1258
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:30,041
..to survey terrorist target locations

1259
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,875
He first made a fake passport

1260
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,416
Took admission in a computer institute..

1261
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:39,375
And then rented an apartment in Lamington road

1262
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:42,000
My client has been living in the apartment for the last two years

1263
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,166
If someone moves to Mumbai he will have to live somewhere

1264
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:46,083
Your honour, all the rental documents..

1265
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:48,041
..have been submitted to the court.

1266
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:51,875
Prosecution was living on rent till 2 years ago. Is she also a terrorist?

1267
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:55,458
Where I live is not the point!

1268
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,541
Don't be personal. Come to the point.

1269
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,458
It's a case of creation of perfect alibi.

1270
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:04,458
That's my point. Thank you.

1271
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:07,875
What is your name?

1272
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,208
Swapnil Mazgaonkar

1273
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:10,708
Swapnil Mazgaonkar

1274
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:12,208
And your institute is in Jogeshwari?

1275
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,291
Yes

1276
01:25:13,791 --> 01:25:16,291
How many students in your institute?

1277
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:17,541
175.

1278
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:18,791
175? Exact?

1279
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:20,083
Exact - Very nice.

1280
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:22,250
So you must know all students well?

1281
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,125
Yes - You must know them by their names

1282
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:28,666
Yes - Excellent

1283
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,291
Can you tell me the name of the boy in the blue shirt?

1284
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:33,208
What is the point of this silly game?

1285
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,041
As someone who studied in his institute

1286
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:38,250
If he can recognize my client

1287
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:40,416
Why can't he recognize other faces?

1288
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:42,333
Your honor, it's a very important point.

1289
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:43,541
Tell me, what's his name?

1290
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:45,916
Go on tell me if you know - This way, it's difficult

1291
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:48,291
You know his name? Yes or no?

1292
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:49,541
Just simply say 'no' if you don't know

1293
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:51,291
Sir, he's forcing him..

1294
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:52,291
I am just asking him.

1295
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:55,250
Yes or no? No.

1296
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:59,625
No. Okay no. Thank you your honor.

1297
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:02,833
What is the minimum qualification for your institute?

1298
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:03,625
12th grade pass

1299
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:04,416
12th.

1300
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:06,708
You collect the marksheet for students?

1301
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,125
Yes. - They must be in your records?

1302
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:12,875
Yes - So, what did you say his name was again?

1303
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:13,916
Sahil Pavaskar

1304
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:19,125
Then you should.. You should have it in your records, right?

1305
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,083
Say it. Aloud

1306
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:23,125
I do - You do?

1307
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:24,416
I do

1308
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:27,625
Do you have written exams in your institute?

1309
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,916
Your students must use paper for the exams

1310
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:31,541
What's this got to do with the use of paper?

1311
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:33,458
The court's time is being wasted

1312
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:37,250
All institutions use paper for examinations

1313
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,375
Maybe the prosecution isn't aware that technology isn't aware

1314
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:43,250
Examinations can be conducted on the internet too.

1315
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:47,041
Our country still uses paper extensively.

1316
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:50,458
The prosecution's entire case is dependent on handwriting.

1317
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:54,750
I suggest we have the handwriting analyzed by forensic experts.

1318
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:58,875
Because their entire case is dependent on handwriting.

1319
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,375
Mr. Mazgaonkar - Yes, sir?

1320
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:05,458
Do you have the important documents the defense needs?

1321
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:06,625
Yes.

1322
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,916
Deposit them in court

1323
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:12,916
Thank you, your honor.

1324
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:18,291
Were there any phone calls? - No.

1325
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:20,208
Come, Mitali - My name is Parangama

1326
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:24,375
Yes

1327
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,541
Yes

1328
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:29,958
Why do you only fight cases for terrorists?

1329
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:32,208
This is your question?

1330
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:34,416
Isn't it true then?

1331
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,250
No. Absolutely not

1332
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,625
Then what is the truth?

1333
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:40,291
Mitali, do you really believe that the police...

1334
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:41,666
Sir, my name is Parangama

1335
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:42,833
Yes, Parangama

1336
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:46,375
Do you honestly believe that the police are always right?

1337
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,416
In that case we wouldn't need the judicial system?

1338
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:51,500
The police would arrest you and that's that.

1339
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,458
I don't expect you to know the truth,

1340
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:57,458
but atleast the pursuit has to be for the truth

1341
01:27:57,958 --> 01:27:58,750
..or are you also like the others,

1342
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,291
who do not care for the common man.

1343
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:02,333
But you are not a common man.

1344
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:06,500
Why do you say that? I even fight cases for the common man

1345
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
The ones who can't afford lawyer's fees

1346
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,458
Those who don't have the means to afford a fair trial.

1347
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:12,791
I fight for them

1348
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:14,375
Not the terrorists

1349
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:18,833
Does that mean you do it to stay in the limelight?

1350
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,958
This is your second question?

1351
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:23,166
Sir...

1352
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:25,666
This is actually my 4th question

1353
01:28:26,166 --> 01:28:29,666
Show me...

1354
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:33,791
Please have some tea

1355
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:36,041
Sorry. This interview is over

1356
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:40,416
Actually, these questions were written by my senior

1357
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:44,000
Then tell your senior to try and find the truth

1358
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:47,416
Tell her to go beyond the questions and try to find some answers too

1359
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:49,791
I know, sir, but still...

1360
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:53,791
Why did you decide to become a lawyer?

1361
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:58,958
How are you my child?

1362
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,041
I'm good.

1363
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,375
Are you fine?

1364
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:03,291
How is your mother?

1365
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:04,500
She's good

1366
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,708
Good.

1367
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:10,041
She got second rank in her class.

1368
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:11,583
Tell your father

1369
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,000
I stood 2nd

1370
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,958
Well done my child

1371
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:19,833
Don't trouble your mother. Ok?

1372
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:21,833
Be good okay.

1373
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:23,500
Your father will be with you soon

1374
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,458
Your father will be with you soon

1375
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:28,125
Do you know Nooruddin?

1376
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:29,375
Yes

1377
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:33,500
They are calling him as a witness

1378
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,500
We never got along in Dubai

1379
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,250
Mr. Nooruddin, how long have you known him?

1380
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,541
He was with me in Dubai

1381
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,500
What did you do in Dubai?

1382
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,541
I was a driver. He was a mechanic

1383
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:54,458
Did you ever feel that he was connected with terrorists?

1384
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:56,125
He met strange people, that I know

1385
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:58,083
They would talk for hours

1386
01:29:58,583 --> 01:29:59,458
What does he mean by strange?

1387
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:03,541
I am not being allowed to question the witness

1388
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:07,083
I want the witness to define "strange"

1389
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:10,458
He is obstructing my questioning

1390
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:11,666
Thank you your honor.

1391
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:15,791
Strange means that they were hard to understand

1392
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,500
Their facial expressions were weird

1393
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,791
Did you know them?

1394
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:20,333
No. I did not even understand the language

1395
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,083
But they used to talk strange and in Arabic

1396
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,166
I only understood Hindi

1397
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:27,083
When did you see him last?

1398
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:28,208
In Nepal

1399
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:29,333
Why had you gone there?

1400
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:31,666
I had gone on a vacation with my wife and children

1401
01:30:32,166 --> 01:30:33,916
Where did you see him first?

1402
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:36,666
I was near my hotel and he passed me by

1403
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:38,666
He looked at me and ignored me as if I was a stranger

1404
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:41,250
He ignored you in Nepal, why?

1405
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,708
I don't know, ask him. Please tell her why you ignored me

1406
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:45,583
What happened after that?

1407
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:50,500
After three four days he came to my hotel in panic

1408
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,500
I ordered food. His phone rang

1409
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,916
His phone kept ringing incessantly

1410
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:55,916
He was carrying papers..

1411
01:30:56,416 --> 01:30:57,250
..which slipped out of his hand and fell on the floor

1412
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,333
Did you see those papers? - Yes, I did

1413
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:00,666
What was in them?

1414
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:04,333
Green, blue, white papers maps. A lot of stuff - Maps, too?

1415
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:05,791
Yes - Like this?

1416
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,416
Yes

1417
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:12,250
Police claims, that you did see him handing over maps to terrorists

1418
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,250
Yes, I had seen him. He used to move around with a bundle of maps

1419
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:15,291
Where did you see him?

1420
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:16,708
In Nepal

1421
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:19,958
These are the same maps used by terrorists..

1422
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,500
..to orchestrate the biggest terror attack in Mumbai.

1423
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:23,833
That's all your honor.

1424
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,791
Thank you. Your witness.

1425
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:30,791
Thank you.

1426
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:36,958
The map looked like this?

1427
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:38,000
A little bigger

1428
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:42,000
A little bigger?

1429
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:45,541
Like this?

1430
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:48,000
Yes

1431
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,500
These maps are available on Google

1432
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,666
Why would any organization rely on a handmade map..

1433
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:54,666
..when a more accurate map is available on internet?

1434
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,291
We don't know if a terrorist organization can stage an attack..

1435
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:59,916
..of such a magnitude with maps provided on internet or not..

1436
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:03,083
..but it looks like Mr. Shahid is an authority on this.

1437
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:04,500
What are you trying to say?

1438
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,041
You have spent a lot of time with terrorist organizations, haven't you?

1439
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:09,666
Are you accusing me? - No, I am not.

1440
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:10,916
Are you accusing me? - No, I am not.

1441
01:32:11,416 --> 01:32:12,541
Are you accusing me? - I'm just stating certain facts.

1442
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:14,041
Am I on trial? You're not on trial.

1443
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:16,125
Am I on trial? Who's on trial. - I'm just stating certain facts.

1444
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:17,958
Am I on trail or Faheem Khan's on trial.

1445
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:19,875
I can sue her for this but I won't.

1446
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:21,958
Shahid sir. Your honor, she's accusing me.

1447
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,125
She's accusing me. I can sue her, but I won't.

1448
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:26,583
What are you implying?

1449
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:27,833
Am I on trial?

1450
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:31,708
Even in Jail you had links with the terrorists inside..

1451
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:33,583
Because this case is about Faheem Khan. Not me!

1452
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:35,708
You have spent a lot of time in jail

1453
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:38,416
You also had links with the terrorists inside

1454
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:39,916
Nothing was proven.

1455
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:42,083
So, are you inferring that you have to be a terrorist if you are in jail?

1456
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,041
I didn't say that - This way even King Shivaji..

1457
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,833
..and Bhagat Singh can be labeled terrorists

1458
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:48,541
So, now you are comparing yourself..

1459
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:49,833
..with King Shivaji and Bhagat Singh

1460
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:51,083
No, I'm not comparing..

1461
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:52,791
All I am saying is that she's accusing me your honor.

1462
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:54,125
Prosecution, please sit down

1463
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:55,916
I can sue her for this, I won't.

1464
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:59,916
Is she saying I am a terrorist? What are you saying?

1465
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:06,166
I've some questions your honor.

1466
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:09,500
Yeah, please.

1467
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,500
Water?

1468
01:33:22,666 --> 01:33:25,000
Mr. Nooruddin, did you go to Nepal on your own expense?

1469
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,750
No, my friend Balwant Thakur paid for the trip

1470
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,333
So, your friend Balwant Thakur paid for the trip - Yes

1471
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:34,250
How did you go to Nepal? Flight? Train? How?

1472
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,500
We took a taxi to the station, then a train.

1473
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,041
And from the station on a taxi to the hotel

1474
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:41,666
What was the name of the train?

1475
01:33:42,166 --> 01:33:43,791
I don't know, I travel to so many places that I don't remember

1476
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:46,125
He does not know the name of the train.

1477
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:48,500
No problem. Which month did you go there?

1478
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
February, 14th February - When did you return?

1479
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,041
No problem, if you don't remember

1480
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:56,625
What is the currency of Nepal? Surely you shopped there?

1481
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,375
My wife handles money

1482
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,625
You did not spend any money?

1483
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:02,166
Where did you stay? - Hotel

1484
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:03,708
How was it? - Good

1485
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,500
Food was good? Did you get good service?

1486
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,375
What was the name of the hotel?

1487
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:12,333
The name of the hotel. Nepal's currency. Name of train.

1488
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:13,750
What is the point of asking all this?

1489
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,875
Can I come to the point?

1490
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:18,291
Public prosecutor, please take a seat

1491
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:19,375
Thank you.

1492
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:21,833
Nooruddin does not know which train he travelled in..

1493
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,625
..when he returned, what is the currency of Nepal..

1494
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:24,666
..or which hotel he stayed in.

1495
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:25,708
But he definitely knows that..

1496
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:27,500
..the papers he saw on the hotel floor was a map..

1497
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,458
..and that map was for targets in Mumbai

1498
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:33,166
Your honor, all I am saying is... we can't trust the witness, he's lying.

1499
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:34,708
Thank you.

1500
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:37,500
You should pay heed to your friends, Shahid

1501
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,125
You can't just take off in the court?

1502
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,791
What happened?

1503
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:43,500
You don't care right?

1504
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,458
Let me call your wife there is no other way you will listen

1505
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:47,583
Please don't

1506
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,333
Why shouldn't I when you say you don't care?

1507
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,125
Are you crazy? she is already upset

1508
01:34:51,625 --> 01:34:53,708
Come here you son of a bitch..

1509
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,958
You dare speak ill about our leaders?

1510
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:58,500
Keep your hands off me

1511
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,500
Keep my hands off? You dare to speak about King Shivaji?

1512
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,500
Do it. Do it.

1513
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:20,833
Are you alright?

1514
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:47,166
I'm coming.

1515
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:48,500
Yes?

1516
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,416
Who is it? - Where is that Shahid?

1517
01:35:50,916 --> 01:35:54,041
He does not live here

1518
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:56,500
I told you he does not live here anymore

1519
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,666
Where does he stay?

1520
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:01,000
I don't know. Don't have his address

1521
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,416
Who are you?

1522
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:03,916
I will tell him myself

1523
01:36:04,416 --> 01:36:05,625
Let me make a call

1524
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,833
No calls...

1525
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:09,666
I will call him myself

1526
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:11,541
Go and do your work

1527
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:16,416
Go on and do your work

1528
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:18,500
Shahid does not live here anymore

1529
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,583
Then where does he live? - Why are you going inside?

1530
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:26,000
Please tell me your name. I will tell him - By when will he come?

1531
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:30,625
I don't know sometimes he comes, sometimes he doesn't.

1532
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:34,791
Please tell me your name and I will tell him

1533
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:36,250
Where is he staying now?

1534
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,708
I don't have the address

1535
01:36:38,208 --> 01:36:40,166
Ok

1536
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:42,458
I will come back

1537
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:46,458
Let's go

1538
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:12,333
They are asking me to back off from the case

1539
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:17,708
Someone came to the house yesterday, looking for me.

1540
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:21,708
No, I won't get Police protection. I know for sure

1541
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:33,458
Is the food ready?

1542
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:35,916
Who came to your mother's house?

1543
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:37,333
Nobody

1544
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:40,250
Why are you scared then?

1545
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:41,375
I'm not scared

1546
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,416
Do you think I'm a fool?

1547
01:37:43,916 --> 01:37:47,125
Who does not understand anything?

1548
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:50,083
You look rattled

1549
01:37:50,583 --> 01:37:53,833
You are not even going to the office

1550
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:57,750
What has happened?

1551
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:01,750
Will you say something?

1552
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:08,083
Threat calls again

1553
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:12,333
You received calls the day before too. Right?

1554
01:38:12,833 --> 01:38:14,916
Did you call the police?

1555
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:16,500
I've asked Ram to draft a letter

1556
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,583
But I know it will result in nothing

1557
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:22,416
Don't worry though. Let's eat

1558
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:24,666
I want you to drop the case

1559
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:26,500
Drop this case

1560
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,291
I can't! You know that

1561
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:30,500
And why should I?

1562
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,791
I don't know how or why

1563
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:35,541
You have to decide, that's it.

1564
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:36,875
Maryam.

1565
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:38,208
What should I decide?

1566
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:39,958
I am telling you for the last time you have to drop this case

1567
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,666
I am not going to drop out. That's it

1568
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:42,916
Now we are not going to talk about it

1569
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:45,416
You'll get us killed Shahid.

1570
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:46,750
Are you mad?

1571
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:47,541
One second

1572
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:49,833
Do you think I'm not concerned about you

1573
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:53,125
Will I get you killed? What kind of bullshit is this?

1574
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:56,333
This is our life. Not some joke

1575
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:59,083
I'm not used to living like this and i won't

1576
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:00,916
I don't have any patience left for this

1577
01:39:01,416 --> 01:39:04,250
What about the people that I am fighting for?

1578
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,916
Where will they go?

1579
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:08,458
To police? Or where?

1580
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:10,291
They depend on me

1581
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:11,458
Yes, they have nobody..

1582
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:12,958
..and we have the whole world at our feet?

1583
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:15,000
Your family means nothing to you

1584
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,375
Sameer and I have no place in your life?

1585
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,333
You've lost your mind

1586
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:23,916
You are overreacting

1587
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:25,500
Listen to me...

1588
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,458
Listen to me...

1589
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:27,666
Don't touch me.

1590
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:31,125
You said..

1591
01:39:31,625 --> 01:39:33,208
You said that I should not back down

1592
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:34,708
Didn't you say that?

1593
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,500
In the restaurant many years ago do you remember you said that?

1594
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,833
I did - And now?

1595
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:40,250
We were not married then

1596
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:44,541
Don't try to play God

1597
01:39:45,041 --> 01:39:48,041
First you decide what do I do?

1598
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:50,875
Maryam,

1599
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:53,666
I'm sorry.

1600
01:39:54,166 --> 01:39:56,958
Let's eat

1601
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:02,333
He's been sick for a week. Do you know?

1602
01:40:02,833 --> 01:40:05,375
Did you take him to the doctor?

1603
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,791
Why didn't you?

1604
01:40:09,291 --> 01:40:13,166
Why did you not take him to the doctor?

1605
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:15,166
Let's go to the doctor

1606
01:40:15,666 --> 01:40:19,166
Maryam.

1607
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:23,458
Maryam.

1608
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:25,416
What are you doing?

1609
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:30,041
What are you doing?

1610
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:33,125
Have you gone completely mad?

1611
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:34,333
Put everything back inside

1612
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:35,500
What are you doing?

1613
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,791
Shahid. - What are you doing?

1614
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:40,666
I will sort everything out. I promise

1615
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:41,750
What will you sort out?

1616
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,583
You can sort out nothing

1617
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:45,166
I love you

1618
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:46,541
I did not give him medicines, did not take him to the doctor

1619
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,791
What were you doing?

1620
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:52,291
I did not know. I am sorry

1621
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:53,583
Don't touch me

1622
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:55,875
Shahid.

1623
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:57,750
Don't touch me.

1624
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:59,291
Please don't do this.

1625
01:40:59,791 --> 01:41:03,291
Please.

1626
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,541
Prosecution has provided the court with two important pieces of evidence

1627
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,500
These are the trousers of the slain terrorist

1628
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,166
Prosecution! Good morning

1629
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:39,083
Can you tell the color of these trousers?

1630
01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:41,291
Can you tell?

1631
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:43,500
No?

1632
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,958
The original color of the trouser is dark green

1633
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,458
But now you can see.

1634
01:41:48,958 --> 01:41:52,125
It's completely soaked in blood

1635
01:41:52,625 --> 01:41:53,875
And your honor.

1636
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:56,416
This map which according to the prosecution ...

1637
01:41:56,916 --> 01:42:00,166
..Faheem Khan had given to the terrorists

1638
01:42:00,666 --> 01:42:02,291
Absolutely clean.

1639
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:04,125
Not even a single drop of blood.

1640
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:07,416
Very nicely creased.

1641
01:42:07,916 --> 01:42:10,333
The map remained in the trousers for three days..

1642
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:13,083
..then how can this be without any blood stains?

1643
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:16,666
How is it possible?

1644
01:42:17,166 --> 01:42:18,250
It's very simple

1645
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:19,916
This map has been planted

1646
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:23,583
Objection. Defense is trying to over-simplify the case, sir.

1647
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:26,750
The case is simple, your honor. It's common sense.

1648
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:31,625
Prosecution's case lacks any logic

1649
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:32,916
Prosecutor.

1650
01:42:33,416 --> 01:42:34,416
Defense has a valid point.

1651
01:42:34,916 --> 01:42:38,416
Please sit down. Thank you, your honor.

1652
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,666
Who is the reporter?

1653
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:49,375
Which page?

1654
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:51,291
One second.

1655
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:53,208
Yes, got it.

1656
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:55,458
I'll call you after reading it.

1657
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:59,458
Bye.

1658
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:38,875
An article is published in the newspaper, on me.

1659
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:41,958
Reformed Radical.

1660
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:44,666
I mean, I was never a terrorist or a radical.

1661
01:43:45,166 --> 01:43:47,791
Why do they write all this bullshit about me?

1662
01:43:48,291 --> 01:43:50,208
And how can they reform me?

1663
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:52,000
What do you want, Shahid?

1664
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:57,041
Why can't they leave me alone?

1665
01:43:57,541 --> 01:44:01,416
They will force you like this, to live in your past.

1666
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:04,125
It's up to you.

1667
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:07,666
You have to start off with a new beginning every day.

1668
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:11,333
Move ahead and just live for a bright future.

1669
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:15,375
You sound so sensible when you are far away.

1670
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:20,916
I was quite sensible, even before.

1671
01:44:21,416 --> 01:44:22,541
You hate me, right?

1672
01:44:23,041 --> 01:44:26,375
I don't want to live a complicated life, Shahid.

1673
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:28,833
I'm coming to bring you back soon.

1674
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:30,083
No.

1675
01:44:30,583 --> 01:44:32,125
I don't want you to come.

1676
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:33,833
Please, Maryam.

1677
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,541
I need you.

1678
01:44:37,041 --> 01:44:40,541
Everybody against me. Please.

1679
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,583
Hello.

1680
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:49,583
Hello.

1681
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,500
All I'm saying is that you need to come at 8 and eat..

1682
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,500
..and then get enough rest

1683
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:05,791
Hello

1684
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:08,541
Ask them to come in the morning

1685
01:45:09,041 --> 01:45:12,333
Ok! I'll be there. Wait

1686
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:15,125
I'll be back in two minutes - First eat

1687
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:16,750
Get the bread ready. I will be back by then

1688
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:20,750
The meal's ready.

1689
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:29,708
Come in

1690
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:32,208
What was so urgent?

1691
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:35,166
Inder, get some water

1692
01:45:35,666 --> 01:45:39,166
You could have come in the morning?

1693
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:43,208
Shahid?

1694
01:45:43,708 --> 01:45:47,208
Shahid!

1695
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:57,333
By showing me injustice, God taught me about justice

1696
01:45:57,833 --> 01:46:00,458
By inflicting pain suffering, He gave me the courage to fight

1697
01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:06,041
He taught me to help the helpless

1698
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:10,750
A criminal knows no religion

1699
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,750
Eventually both the killer and his victim are human

1700
01:46:18,791 --> 01:46:20,750
Your honor.

1701
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,541
My summation is the same as my friend..

1702
01:46:24,041 --> 01:46:27,208
..Late Advocate Shahid Azmi

1703
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:28,500
Your honor.

1704
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Prosecution has provided no credible evidence so far..

1705
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:42,375
..which can prove beyond doubt that Faheem Khan is guilty

1706
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:44,000
On the contrary...

1707
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,583
..most of the evidence presented..

1708
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:50,583
..reiterates Faheem Khan's innocence

1709
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:55,916
When police arrests a common man in a terrorism case

1710
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:58,083
Whether he is guilty or not.

1711
01:46:58,583 --> 01:47:02,125
The world already makes It's own judgment..

1712
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:08,250
..for the rest of his life he is maligned...

1713
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,541
Your honor.

1714
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:14,416
Once again our Judiciary has been burdened with the responsibility..

1715
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:19,208
..to correct a grave mistake committed by police and society..

1716
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:23,208
..and to save an innocent man from getting wrongly persecuted

1717
01:47:28,541 --> 01:47:32,666
Justice is also due to the man..

1718
01:47:33,166 --> 01:47:34,416
..who always defended the defenseless..

1719
01:47:34,916 --> 01:47:36,833
..and lost his life, fighting for the cause.

1720
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:40,833
That's all your honor. Thank you.

1721
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:24,375
"Without any care, the colour has started to drain away"

1722
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:35,750
"I feel detached and dismayed"

1723
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:40,958
"I can't express my condition"

1724
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:45,958
"I'll get sacrificed surely"

1725
01:48:46,458 --> 01:48:51,250
"Life seems to have gotten angry with me"

1726
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:57,625
"My heart-beats are now like smoke"

1727
01:48:58,125 --> 01:49:02,500
"I don't see ..."

1728
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,791
"...any solution..."

1729
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:12,750
"...nor do I see a direction,

1730
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:16,750
"...to head towards my destination."

1731
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:54,875
"Love has slipped away"

1732
01:49:55,375 --> 01:50:01,458
"There isn't any care remaining"

1733
01:50:01,958 --> 01:50:10,250
"My heart just remains a assembly of thoughts"

1734
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:22,000
"No whereabouts... About the destination or direction."

1735
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:26,000
"I've reduced to ashes."

1736
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:14,500
"Without any care, the colour has started to drain away"

1737
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:26,041
"I feel detached and dismayed"

1738
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:31,166
"I can't express my condition"

1739
01:51:31,666 --> 01:51:36,208
"I'll get sacrificed surely"

1740
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:41,541
"Life seems to have gotten angry with me"

1741
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:47,708
"My heart-beats are now like smoke"

1742
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:52,708
"I don't see ..."

1743
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:58,041
"...any solution..."

1744
01:51:58,541 --> 01:52:02,958
"...nor do I see a direction,

1745
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:08,791
"...to head towards my destination."
