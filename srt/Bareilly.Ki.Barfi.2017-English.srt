1
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,854
Ekta Nagar, Bareilly.

2
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:29,826
Of all the houses in
this neighborhood, the most unique...

3
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:33,522
'...or, you can say the most
amusing is Mishra Sadan.

4
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:36,968
Because here, the
morning is not normal.

5
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:38,927
The evening is not normal.

6
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,038
Nor are the people normal.

7
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,799
Shushila...

8
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,737
Where is my cigarette?

9
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,016
Last night there was one left
in the packet. Now it's disappeared!

10
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,824
On, God...
I can't take a dump without it.

11
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,319
And, I've to make an urgent
delivery to Bijoriya today.

12
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,157
If I don't freshen up now and suddenly
the pressure increases on the way...

13
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,197
I'll be in big trouble.

14
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,929
Go ask Bitti for a cigarette.
Tell her it's urgent.

15
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,759
How would Bitti have a cigarette?

16
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,402
She smokes!!!

17
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,201
Go-go...

18
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,809
This was the only thing
missing in her life now.

19
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,573
God save us from such a daughter.
Just wait and watch...

20
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,482
Soon, you'll find bottles
of country liquor.

21
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,711
Bitti! Still sleeping!

22
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,552
Wake up.

23
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:29,986
What are you doing, sweetheart?

24
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,422
Get up! Queen of sweetheart

25
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,528
what mummy!! It was such a nice dream.

26
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,387
That's all you do.

27
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:39,563
Bitti!

28
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:40,897
Bitti!

29
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,099
What?

30
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,702
Do you have a cigarette?
Huh!

31
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,668
Since when did you start smoking?

32
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,138
Your father wants one.
I don't smoke.

33
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,937
Don't lie.
If you have one. Give me it me now!

34
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,171
I said I don't smoke.
Wanna bet.

35
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,013
Your father has to go to Bijoriya.

36
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,817
He can't take a dump.
What can I do?

37
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,183
He will be big trouble
if he has to go on the way.

38
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,287
I'll go and ask someone.

39
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:09,522
I knew it... you only
stole my cigarette.

40
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,663
Scream a little louder. The pressure will
increase, it will happens on it's own.

41
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:20,435
Uncle, papa needs one urgently.
I've only one, dear.

42
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:21,706
It's OK.

43
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,784
Where's papa?

44
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,083
Any luck?

45
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,555
Here you go.

46
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,029
Thank you, Bitti.

47
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,396
Wash your hands.
But, I didn't take a dump.

48
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,801
Doesn't matter.

49
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,172
I drank that water.
I'm only washing my hands.

50
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,604
This is Bitti Mishra.

51
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,577
Daughter of Mrs. Sushila Mishra.

52
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,843
And son of Mr. Narhottam Mishra.

53
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,850
After all,
he has raised her like a son only.

54
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:15,988
Sushila Mishra... teaches
children at Narmada Primary School...

55
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,894
'...what Bitti Mishra
never learned in her life.

56
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,526
Always listen to your elders...

57
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,831
And Narhottam Mishra's words...

58
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,635
...are sweeter than his sweets.
Isn't Shanu my daughter too?

59
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,773
What if you run out
of sweets at her wedding...

60
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,744
...won't I feel humiliated as well?

61
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,438
Son, add 5 more kilos.

62
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,882
I'll be right back.

63
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,484
Bitti, who is this crow?

64
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,782
He's not a crow.
He's a peacock.

65
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,017
Must have not taken a hath today.

66
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,353
But, who is he?
He's from our neighborhood.

67
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,926
My bike was out of fuel.

68
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,461
I asked for a lift and he obliged.

69
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,394
I said drop me, he said okay.

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,227
Enough of that, give me 100 rupees.

71
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:56,802
I don't have.
You get a fat salary.

72
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,234
I bought you this
sweater from my salary right?

73
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:02,499
Take it off.

74
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,141
Listen, Bitti.

75
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,415
Sit on a motorcycle,
with both your legs on one side.

76
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:18,514
Bitti Mishra...
never listens to advice.

77
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,124
Doesn't have too many good habits.

78
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,790
She once ate non-veg
unintentionally.

79
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,865
Now she eats at every
opportunity.

80
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,339
In India it has not even released.

81
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:37,009
English films
are locally premiered...

82
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:40,270
'...at her best friend
Rama's boutique.

83
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,906
She understands only 60 percent...

84
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,643
...but explains 100 percent.

85
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,013
I want to break up with you.

86
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,381
I want to break you.

87
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,986
Are you kidding me?
Have you become mad?

88
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,382
The electricity keeps
going in the lanes...

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,654
'...and Bitti's tape keeps
playing without a break.

90
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,957
There's a power cut in the entire city
but it will be restored soon enough.

91
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,259
We regret the inconvenience caused.

92
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,458
But there's electricity
at our neighbor's home.

93
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,230
Uncle, they have an inverter,
you should also buy one.

94
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,063
And just not these
good for nothing boys...

95
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:11,507
'...but, the entire neighborhood
is a fan of her break dance.

96
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,912
Any wedding when the DJ starts,

97
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:17,241
'...Bitti's feet start
tapping on its own.

<i>Your waist twists like this...</i>

121
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,420
Aarush, have a sweet.

122
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,024
No aunty, I don't eat sweets.

123
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,834
Why don't both of you
speak in private, son?

124
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,868
Okay Aunty.

125
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,369
Go, speak to him.

126
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,662
Go.

127
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:29,974
Our daughter Bitti works at the
Electricity board's Complaint Department.

128
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:34,074
The Complaint Department gets
hundreds of complaints every day.

129
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:37,786
But, not a single complaint
against our daughter Bitti.

130
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,857
It occasionally happens in parties...

131
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:43,052
...otherwise, I don't drink.

132
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:48,324
I just wanted to ask you one question.

133
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:49,867
Ask.

134
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,402
Are you a...

135
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,533
Are you... a virgin?

136
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,107
Virgin?

137
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,306
Are you?

138
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,178
It doesn't matter...

139
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:10,212
But, it does matter
whether you are or not!

140
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,791
No, I'm not! Now?

141
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,925
So many boys have met her,
but they all rejected her.

142
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,761
There must be something
wrong with our girl.

143
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,626
If I try talking to her,
she gets angry.

144
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,465
And you don't know how to.
What do I do?

145
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,733
This is entirely your fault.

146
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,772
She behaves like a guy.

147
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,341
We should've had a boy instead.

148
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,806
Now where are you going?

149
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,246
But there's one thing...

150
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:40,183
'...that always bothers
Bitti's mother.

151
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,551
Bitti can't find a suitor.

152
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,922
Her engagement was canceled twice.

153
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,161
What's wrong?
Nothing.

154
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:10,875
Dear... don't take your
mother too seriously.

155
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,714
She loves you lot.

156
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,186
You know she has thyroid.

157
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,225
Constant mood swings,
and can't stop bickering.

158
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,454
Papa, can I ask you something?

159
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,035
Everything would've been
much easier if I was a boy.

160
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,433
No questions asked.

161
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:41,368
He smokes cigarettes.
But, he's a boy.

162
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,908
Wanders out all night.

163
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,051
But boys normally do, don't they?

164
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:55,024
He's a loudmouth,
but has a heart of gold.

165
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,524
So what if his engagement
got canceled twice.

166
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,199
He didn't like the girl.

167
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:07,700
He just can't marry anyone.

168
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,209
Being a girl is a complete disaster.

169
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,616
Dear, that's how the society is.

170
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,586
I don't believe in their norms, but...

171
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,421
...we still have
to live in this society.

172
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,550
Stop... Stop...

173
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,985
Stop, Need a drop to the station?
Come.

174
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,602
Ticket.
Where to?

175
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,670
Anywhere.

176
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,864
Anywhere?
Yes.

177
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,013
Are you traveling alone, madam?
Yes.

178
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,445
Where?

179
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,887
To my mother's home.

180
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,012
Home?

181
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:36,024
No Bindi. No mangalsutra.
You don't look like a bride at all.

182
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,653
I am Christian.

183
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:42,258
Oh, Christian! Happy journey.

184
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:51,906
<i>The train travelling
to Jaam Nagar...</i>

185
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:57,541
<i>No. 14 674.</i>

186
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,343
<i>Shaheed Express...</i>

187
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:01,618
<i>...from it's actual time.</i>

188
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,445
<i>...is delayed by two hours.</i>

189
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,355
<i>We regret the inconvenience
caused to passengers.</i>

190
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,189
Brother.

191
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:14,295
Oh! Brother.

192
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,858
Brother!!!

193
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,037
Yes.
How much is that book for?

194
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,607
Which one?
The One that woke you up.

195
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,680
150 rupees.
150?

196
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:36,147
Don't you have anything cheaper?
Cheaper...

197
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,149
How about this one?

198
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,893
It's worth 80,
but I'll charge you only 60.

199
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,892
Bareilly Ki Barfi.

200
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,661
Fine...
I'll give it to you for 50.

201
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,131
Nothing less than 40,
I am sorry... No.

202
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,034
Fine... 30.

203
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,669
30 rupees.

204
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,782
Mummy...

205
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,125
I am going away, Mummy.

206
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,831
This is the only best way to save papa
and you from all the trouble.

207
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:58,201
I am also taking along
with me 2000 rupees...

208
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:02,297
...which you had
hidden in your blouse.

209
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:07,443
Please don't try
finding the money or me!

210
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,471
Your headache.

211
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,551
Bitti...

212
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,412
Where do you think
you were running away, witch?

213
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,589
Running away from home.

214
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,885
Then why didn't you?

215
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,119
Because I can't see your happiness.

216
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,286
You know how much
I will beat you... if..

217
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,852
If you're done with
north south pole emotional hug...

218
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:26,954
...then, make some tea for me
without sugar.

219
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,232
Rama. Ra...

220
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,662
Have you lost your mind?
Running away from home...

221
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,831
See, this will blow your mind away.

222
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,600
Bareilly Ki Barfi.
Read more..

223
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,981
A few years ago, a popular international...
Not the entire book.

224
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,639
Just read what I've highlighted.

225
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:48,980
Read this part.

226
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,456
She stays in Bareilly.

227
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,288
Enjoys break-dances.

228
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,525
Secretly smokes cigarettes.

229
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,088
Always lays a 100
rupees bet in any chat.

230
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,700
Oh my God! That's you!

231
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,667
Bareilly Ki Barfi'...Bitti.

232
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,271
You won't believe...

233
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,705
He's written things,
only you and I know about.

234
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,003
Are you serious?
Yes...

235
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,771
Then, he must have
written about me also.

236
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,104
Forget about you, and look at me.

237
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,843
This means... I am not the
only one who's this way.

238
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,385
And there's someone
in this world who thinks...

239
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,387
I am what I am, it's perfect
and he likes just the way I am.

240
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,618
Isn't it?
Yes.

241
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,817
But... who's the author?

242
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,526
Turn.

243
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,697
Uff! Turn it around.

244
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,629
He's the author.

245
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,198
Pritam Vidrohi.

246
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,333
Do you know him?

247
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,269
Now you must be thinking
this is Pritam Vidrohi.

248
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,105
'No... he is not.

249
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,751
He's the only 'Chirag'
(Light) of his family.

250
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,343
Chirag Dubey.

251
00:17:56,276 --> 00:18:00,383
His father wanted him
to become a doctor or engineer...

252
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,790
'...and mint money.

253
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,551
Well, he's still minting...

254
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,960
But pamphlets, visiting cards,
wedding cards,

255
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:10,331
et cetera, in his
father's printing press.

256
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:14,031
It's not 'beds'... it's 'Weds'.

257
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,904
Works hard all day...

258
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,739
'...and drinking
a peg in the evening...

259
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,377
...with Babli.

260
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,778
You don't see Babli.

261
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,683
Ah! There she is.

262
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,791
They say time heals every wound.

263
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,126
But his wound is still ripe.

264
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,863
Five years ago...
Babli used to be in his arms...

265
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,729
'...and not just in his purse.

266
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:46,334
It was hard for him
to pass time without Babli...

267
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,337
'...but, he was just a
time pass for Babli.

268
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,304
Papa.

269
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:54,369
At Babli's wedding,
he cried more than she did.

270
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,279
After losing the first innings...

271
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,216
...never mustered the courage
to play second.

272
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,548
Because he never
like anyone after that.

273
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,619
Because even today... he's trying to
find Babli in every girl.

274
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:16,594
The night Babli left him for good...

275
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:19,700
'...that same night,
he took this unwavering oath...

276
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,832
'...of making his
love-story immortal.

277
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,673
And his best friend
Munna read the first draft.

278
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,878
Did you write this?

279
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,415
My tears made me.

280
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,553
get your picture clicked, brother.

281
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,384
You'll need to publish
it with the book.

282
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,316
But Chirag was a true lover.

283
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,356
If he had published the
book with his own picture...

284
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,129
'...then, Babli would be humiliated.

285
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,529
If he had published
it with Munna's picture...

286
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,498
'...then the book would've
been humiliated.

287
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,833
Now there only one...

288
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,131
so-called friend in the radar..'

289
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,774
But, you wrote this Chirag brother.
Yes, so?

290
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:05,007
So how can you publish it in my name?
Why not?

291
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:10,183
You can, but you shouldn't...
I mean... it's unfair.

292
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,224
Unfair is if I publish
this with your name...

293
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,690
...and there's nothing
you can do about it.

294
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,388
Look Vidrohi, you're my friend.

295
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:24,334
So, sticking to the
protocol of friendship...

296
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,563
...I am asking you for permission.

297
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,071
One more thing, boy.

298
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,103
Never cross paths of a rejected lover.

299
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,508
Or else, you'll never
find true love, get it?

300
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,719
Bro, What if mother see this photo...
Now pose...

301
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,720
Go on...

302
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,448
Ready.
Wide smile.

303
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,653
Smile.

304
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:59,699
After this, in his own printing
press he secretly published...

305
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,238
Bareilly Ki Barfi.

306
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,075
Pritam Vidrohi ...Down-Down!

307
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,580
Then Pritam Vidrohi got the
beating of his life. - Mother...

308
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,640
...from the women.
Mother...

309
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,477
But only in a break.

310
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,951
Pritam Vidrohi ...Down-Down!
Mother...

311
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,527
And before his scary dream
could come true...

312
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,561
Pritam Vidrohi packed
a photo of his mom...

313
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,725
...and fled from the
city fearing humiliation.

314
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,566
But there was no need for that.

315
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,432
Not a single copy of
Bareilly Ki Barfi was sold.

316
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,536
The only place they were
in demand was the old paper-mart.

317
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:48,611
No one read it...
but definitely ate in it.

318
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,852
For the love of his friendship...

319
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,792
'...Munna kept 10 copies
in his stall...

320
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:00,020
...with due prominence.

321
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,224
The first was
copy sold in five years...

322
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,870
'...which Bitti bought few days ago.

323
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,801
Who is this Pritam Vidrohi?

324
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,937
Even Google can't find him.

325
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,535
Is that him?

326
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,413
That's Pritam- the music director.

327
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,682
Why are you so crazy after him?

328
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,683
Why shouldn't I he?
He has changed my life.

329
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,448
The only detail about
him is that he's from Bareilly.

330
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,354
But, I've never heard about him.

331
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,224
Look at his face...

332
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:33,491
...feels like he's
smiling under duress.

333
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,874
That's the shop.

334
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,432
Brother.
Yes.

335
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,506
I bought this book from here.

336
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,847
Books once sold will
not he taken back.

337
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,041
No... not... never...

338
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,014
I wouldn't sell it for a million.

339
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,385
Huh! Did you like it so much?
Listen...

340
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,523
This guy, Pritam Vidrohi...
the author.

341
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,715
Where can I find him?

342
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,757
Why?
Why do you care?

343
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,488
Meaning?
Just answer my question.

344
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,494
Where can I find him?

345
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,731
It says here that
he lives in Bareilly.

346
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:11,234
He used to...
But no one knows where he is now!

347
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:16,933
You wouldn't know.

348
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:21,945
Lets go.

349
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,415
And what if I find him?

350
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,442
Then you will need to find me!
Take down my address.

351
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,585
She wanted to know
who's the writer.

352
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:32,983
I see...

353
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,820
Brother, you've spent
many years in exile.

354
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:38,053
It's time to gear
up for second innings.

355
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:39,653
Leave it...

356
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,400
I would not leave if someone
had shown so much interest in me.

357
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:43,593
I know.

358
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,929
I know too! Her address!

359
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,676
This is your matter, brother.
You go.

360
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:01,110
Why am I going?

361
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,052
There's no reason for me to go.
I won't go.

362
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,316
No... not... never...

363
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,863
Yes...
I'm from Government Census counting.

364
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,540
Count yourself.

365
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,936
Number of people in the family.

366
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:26,333
See for yourself.

367
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,581
You two and...
One daughter.

368
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:37,945
Only one?
One's enough brother.

369
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,452
Is she married?
Unfortunately not.

370
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,618
Why?

371
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:44,727
What do you mean?

372
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,987
I mean she will get married.
No doubt about it.

373
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,493
And whenever she does...

374
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,832
...get the wedding cards printed
from my brother's press.

375
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,428
He's got a shop close by,
around the corner.

376
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,773
Good Luck Printing Press.

377
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,536
He also prints books.

378
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,538
That's where Bareilly
Ki Barfi was printed.

379
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,203
Are you married, son?

380
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:05,143
I am, aunty.
And soon I'll become a father.

381
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:06,383
Then, get lost.

382
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,146
Have you seen the
population of the country?

383
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:10,081
There is a lot of work.
get going. Come on.

384
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:17,524
Well... I've set the stage,
and everything's in place...

385
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,421
...and dropped the hail as well.

386
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,559
The rest lies in your hands.

387
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,663
Let's see if you can reel her in.

388
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:28,635
But he careful.

389
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,730
Because it's a mad family.

390
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,078
It's not 'Beds' its 'Weds'.

391
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:42,348
Dumb...

392
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,614
Yes...

393
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:46,652
Welcome to Good Luck Printing Press.

394
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,489
It is supremely famous for wedding
cards, birthday cards, visiting cards...

395
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,222
...funerals, venerations,
rites-rituals, etc etc.

396
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,129
And books also?

397
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,828
Where did you find this?

398
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,395
Where can I find him?

399
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,132
There's no way to find him.

400
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:03,470
You're few years too late, madam.
He is no more?

401
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,907
Well, he is no more in this city.
I see...

402
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,242
Well then, phone number, email,
address anything is alright.

403
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,441
You won't get anything.
Why not?

404
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:13,548
You see, ma'am, our company
follows a strict privacy policy.

405
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,914
Fans pester them a lot.

406
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,317
Sometimes they cut their nerve
or jump off the roof.

407
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,820
One of them even
swallowed rat poison.

408
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,447
These fans die, And then decent
people like us get stuck in between.

409
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,190
By the way,
what is this so important matter?

410
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,789
It's personal.

411
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:26,219
Anyway, thank you.

412
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,664
Listen...

413
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:31,394
Since... your reason is so important,
I can make an effort...

414
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,831
...but, only if you tell
me what was is so urgent.

415
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:35,705
I...
Brother card.

416
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,811
Your ice cream has melted completely.

417
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:49,609
Yes.

418
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:55,827
You mean to say you
are Bareilly Ki Barfi.

419
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:57,522
Ditto.

420
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,194
How is that possible?

421
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,821
Exactly that's what
I want to find out.

422
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,869
Can you...

423
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:08,465
I can.

424
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:13,442
English film.
I do...

425
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:14,772
Do you understand?

426
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,442
Of course, if you watch
you will understand too.

427
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:22,814
This is why I want to meet Mr.
Vidrohi.

428
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,689
How does he know me so well?

429
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,249
How would I know?
Yes, how will you know?

430
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,356
Exactly.

431
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:34,827
I can't give you his
phone number and address.

432
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:37,561
And he's not on Facebook,
email, etc.

433
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,829
You know what...

434
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:42,669
...write a letter to him.

435
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:45,376
I'll deliver it to him.

436
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,403
And what if he replies.

437
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:50,506
I'll deliver it to you.

438
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:55,148
That's right.

439
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,583
Add it on my lab.

440
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:58,679
Okay brother.

441
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:08,758
Bitti is Bareilly Ki Barfi.

442
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,767
That's what she claims.

443
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,601
Oh God! Hats off to you...
What did you do?

444
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:18,709
One mango with two seeds.
One Bitti and the other Babli.

445
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,939
Does she know you're the author?

446
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:26,143
Are you going to tell her?

447
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:30,577
First let me find out whether
she's telling the truth.

448
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,150
What if it's true?

449
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:37,923
I'll give it a try.

450
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,455
And, what if she's lying?

451
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,361
Well then, I am already in exile.
True.

452
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:45,901
See...

453
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,063
If he was on Facebook
we could've have messaged him.

454
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:51,464
How about this one?

455
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,370
This one.

456
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,742
No...
I look too healthy in this one.

457
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,446
Why are you sending
your photo along.

458
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:02,778
Just send the letter.

459
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:06,321
Well... Romeo should know
how his Juliet looks like.

460
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:13,722
How about this?
My stomach's also visible in this one.

461
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,426
Nice!!

462
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:21,400
Brother, even her stomach's
visible in this one.

463
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,101
She's advanced like
sister-in-law Babli.

464
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,013
What has she written in the letter?

465
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:34,649
Dear Pritam...

466
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:38,545
Everyone only sees
the fault side of me.

467
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,225
But, in the same faults
you saw my positives.

468
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:44,694
I am really happy to know this.

469
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,259
Even more happier that now
somewhere in this world there's...

470
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,764
...someone who understands me
and likes me for the way I am.

471
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,627
If you ever come to Bareilly...

472
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,259
...then do meet me.

473
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,630
The sweets from our
shop are also as sweet.

474
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,034
Your Babli... Bitti.

475
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,276
Bro... she's become emotional!

476
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,682
You've become emotional too!

477
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,796
'Chirag's pen was no
longer filled with tears...

478
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,332
'...but joy instead.

479
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,098
Babli was history...

480
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,069
'...and a new story awaited him.

481
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,367
Brother Chirag.

482
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,936
Tillu... make one for
brother Chirag as well.

483
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,376
Why did you ask me to stop?
I am in a hurry!

484
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,415
But what's the hurry?
Need to give her the letter.

485
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,608
Ohh...

486
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,276
She wrote to you yesterday and
you're sending her a reply today.

487
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,855
So? - Even the internet
in Bareilly isn't this fast.

488
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:47,322
You must wait for few days
before sending her a reply.

489
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:49,651
Or else you will get caught!

490
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:50,987
I see.

491
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:57,861
Did he reply?

492
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,628
He will.

493
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,909
Did he reply?

494
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,107
He will.

495
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:27,598
Yes...
Hello, uncle.

496
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:28,960
Hello. Hello.

497
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:30,433
How can I help you?

498
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,992
Uncle, I own a press.

499
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,871
Congratulations.
I have a confectionery shop.

500
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,931
By the way, how much do you
charge for pressing a single shirt.

501
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,034
No, uncle, I own a press... 'press'.

502
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,771
What can I do, son?

503
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,314
Papa, he's Mr. Chirag.

00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:49,917
Hello. You did tell me about him.
Sit down.

506
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:50,848
Yes.

507
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,355
So what brings you here?

508
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,982
Well, our shop will
soon he completing 50 years.

509
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,459
So, is he buying our shop?

510
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,994
No... if we print some
golden jubilee pamphlets...

511
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,896
...we will get some publicity.
Hello. - Hello.

512
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:03,723

In golden ink... no extra charge.

514
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,401
Very good.
What's your name, son?

515
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,629
Chirag Dubey.

516
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,968
Are you married?

517
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,235
No, aunty. I am still single.
How about some juice?

518
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,504
Let it be, no need...

519
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,241
I can't let you leave just like that.

520
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,973
Forget her.

521
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:21,018
Print 1200 for 400 rupees.

522
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,348
We're like family...
it will be done.

523
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,014
I'll WhatsApp you
when the job's done.

524
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:26,886
Just keep your 3G on.

525
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:29,917
Sushila, give him my phone number.
I don't remember it.

526
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,622
How can I know your number?

527
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:34,254
I don't call you myself,
how can I remember.

528
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,458
Write down mine.
Yes.

529
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:38,001
Why? He will give you a missed call.
Papa, I'll give him my number.

530
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:39,468
Take down my number.

531
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,664
Why don't you feed it yourself.

532
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,068
Okay.
Son, juice.

533
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,138
Thank you.

534
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,570
Oh, benevolent Lord.

535
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:50,946
Great.

536
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:54,050
See you, uncle.

537
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:24,073
<i>Stay with me...
like the hum on my lips...</i>

538
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:29,878
<i>...and I'll stay with
you like your dreams.</i>

539
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:35,921
<i>Dwell in my soul... like love...</i>

540
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:41,999
<i>run in the direction...
the trumpets blare.</i>

541
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:11,553
<i>Hold my hands...
sweetheart, I promise.</i>

542
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:17,400
<i>Now you're my desire, my intent.</i>

543
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:22,900
<i>Say my name, beloved...
I am your world.</i>

544
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:28,908
<i>The rains follow
you wherever you go.</i>

545
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:31,409
<i>The rains follow...</i>

546
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:37,416
<i>Stay in my breath...
like the sweet fragrance.</i>

547
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:43,256
<i>And... I'll pray for your grace.</i>

548
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:49,265
<i>Dwell in my soul... like love...</i>
Sometime talk to us also.

549
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:55,273
<i>Run in the direction...
the trumpets blare.</i>

550
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:15,285
<i>Your love-letter... is still
stored in my heart, sweetheart.</i>

551
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:18,028
<i>Your love-letter sweetheart.</i>

552
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:23,925
<i>wonder what lies in my fate.</i>

553
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,964
She's exactly like
sister-in-law Babli.

554
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:34,038
95%
<i>wonder what lies in my fate.</i>

555
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:37,712
<i>Stay with me...</i>
Except for the mole on her back.

556
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,719
<i>...like the hum on my lips...</i>

557
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,768
I like you.

558
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,438
What did I do?

559
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:15,878
Actually, I've always come across
stubborn and chauvinistic type of boys.

560
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,078
God knows what they
think of themselves...

561
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:20,013
...and treat other women like dirt.

562
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,227
And me?

563
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:27,796
You...

564
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:35,265
You're like a... Libran.

565
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:37,264
Libran.

566
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:39,765
What a lucky guess.
You are.

567
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:41,101
I am a Libran.

568
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,975
See.
A pure Libra.

569
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:49,117
Librans always maintain a balance.

570
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,083
Like my father.

571
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:57,318
Always maintaining a
balance between me and my mother.

572
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:04,432
Then your birthday must be nearing!

573
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,363
It's closing in 23 minutes...

574
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:12,103
Today is your birthday!

575
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:16,310
get up.

576
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,243
Where?
get up... I said get up.

577
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,041
Let's go, I'll tell you on the way.
Why?

578
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:21,981
Come on...
That's expensive stuff.

579
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,879
Here... here...

580
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,692
Lovla Sweets...
Lovely sweets.

581
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:31,692
The 'y' fell off in the last monsoon.

582
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:33,320
Come on, we don't have much time.

583
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:36,324
How will you open the lock?
You don't have the key.

584
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,800
This is only to keep the thieves away.

585
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:42,236
Are you crazy?
Yeah... don't you know.

586
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,686
What are you doing?

587
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,232
Happy Birthday Mr. Chirag.

588
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,247
How is it?

589
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:30,416
Spicy.

590
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:39,924
<i>stay with me... like the hum on my lips...</i>
Now?

591
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:45,764
<i>...and I'll stay with
you like your dreams.</i>

592
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:51,636
<i>Dwell in my soul... like love...</i>
Bye.

593
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:57,745
<i>Run in the
direction... the trumpets blare.</i>

594
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,217
Son...

595
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:16,290
He looks okay, got a long nose.

596
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,892
No moles on his face either.

597
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:23,236
But even moles can be cut
off with horse's hair.

598
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,901
He owns a printing press,
so must be earning well too.

599
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:28,668
Also, he has a motorcycle.

600
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,681
Let's assume that even if his
press shuts down, then...

601
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:34,411
We still have the confectionery shop.

602
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:37,144
The least he can do
is shoo away the flies.

603
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,988
Isn't it?

604
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,388
I know what Vidrohi
writes in his letters.

605
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,130
I see...
So tell me, James Bond.

606
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:57,437
That you say such cute things.
You have a nice handwriting.

607
00:39:57,997 --> 00:39:59,032
And whenever he opens his letter...

608
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:01,111
...he can smell your faint fragrance.

609
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:03,707
That's nothing new.
The entire neighborhood can.

610
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,906
Guess what do I write in the letter?

611
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:10,887
You're dying to meet him, right?

612
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,852
What happened?

613
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:20,596
Tell me...

614
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:22,599
I've written to him thrice...

615
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,860
...that I want to meet him.

616
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:28,328
But he ignores my requests.

617
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:30,966
Maybe he doesn't want to meet you.

618
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:34,508
Fine, then...

619
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:37,707
...I'll stop writing to him.
Maybe he does.

620
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:39,749
I don't know.

621
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,949
I want to meet him only once.

622
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:46,313
I have a right to meet the
man who knows so much about me.

623
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,715
Isn't it?

624
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:53,763
Only you know him...
please introduce us once.

625
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:58,564
What if you don't like him?
Doesn't matter.

626
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,937
And, what if you do?

627
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:06,338
If I do, then even my
mom and dad should like him.

628
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,473
If they do, Hi ...otherwise, bye.

629
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:14,684
Please help me meet him once
I'll do anything you say.

630
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,119
Please, just once.

631
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:21,250
Just once.

632
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:23,489
Just once.

633
00:41:27,453 --> 00:41:29,262
But, how will you make them meet?

634
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,363
Vidrohi ran away years ago.

635
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,432
Who knows whether
he's still alive or dead?

636
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,661
Who's introducing her to Vidrohi?

637
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:37,366
Then?

638
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:42,743
Who's the real author of the book?
You?

639
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,207
And who wrote the letter?
You?

640
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,383
So who will go to meet her?

641
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,041
You!

642
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:52,581
Brother, hang it on this.

643
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:56,849
Take brother.

644
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,019
Let's meet in the evening.

645
00:41:58,117 --> 00:41:59,596
It's your turn today.

646
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:04,999
See, Bareilly Ki Barfi.

647
00:42:05,124 --> 00:42:08,003
This book is messing her mind.

648
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:11,902
It says here if she smokes,
she's good.

649
00:42:11,964 --> 00:42:15,173
If she watches English films, she's sweet.
So what's wrong?

650
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:17,373
Do you want to know what's wrong?
See...

651
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,914
There's that boy, Chirag.

652
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,917
He's so well-mannered, talented.

653
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,283
And look at him, wretch.

654
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,747
Don't call him wretch.

655
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,286
Why not?

656
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:29,450
I would poison his juice.

657
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:31,590
Son, you?

658
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:33,923
I was passing by and
heading towards Ghanta Ghar...

659
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,761
...and thought I should
stop and pay you a visit.

660
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:38,027
I'll get some juice for you.
No, no, aunty.

661
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,000
I guess you guys are busy
in some kind of family discussion.

662
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,936
I'll leave.
Your Bareilly Ki Barfi.

663
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:43,940
Here.
Groundnuts.

664
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,365
Thank you.
Bless you.

665
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:54,107
On one side is the girl...

666
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:56,982
...who's head-over-heels
in love with the author.

667
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:01,784
And on the other side is her mother,
who's willing to take his life.

668
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:05,956
So what are you planning to do now?

669
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:07,390
This is love, Munna...

670
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:10,066
...it demands sacrifice.

671
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:16,764
Then chalk-out another
name in the name of love.

672
00:43:18,197 --> 00:43:20,803
Don't you have any brains?

673
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,676
Why?
Whose name is on the book?

674
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:26,175
Pritam Vidrohi.
And the photo on the book?

675
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,783
Pritam Vidrohi.

676
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:30,512
So who will make the sacrifice?

677
00:43:31,577 --> 00:43:33,284
Pritam Vidrohi.

678
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:38,561
Brother, your first love
made him flee from the city.

679
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:42,323
What if your second
love demands his life?

680
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:45,492
No-no... one should not
treat someone so badly.

681
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:56,144
Forget it, let's do it.

682
00:43:56,602 --> 00:43:57,808
It's going to be fun.

683
00:44:03,342 --> 00:44:04,844
But where is he these days?

684
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:15,989
Hello, son.

685
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:19,493
Sit down, it has been really long.
Sit, son.

686
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:20,895
Have some tea.

687
00:44:20,993 --> 00:44:23,269
Aunty, no need for these formalities.

688
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:25,338
So, what brings you here?

689
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:26,669
What can I say, aunty?

690
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:28,572
I was going through my old album...

691
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:32,079
...and noticed
Vidrohi's innocent face.

692
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:35,116
And then... I really
started missing him.

693
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,286
Where is he these days?

694
00:44:38,544 --> 00:44:41,388
He's become a big man now.

695
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,289
Works at a really big company, as a...

696
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:46,289
What is it called? Sales Manager.

697
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:47,529
get it?

698
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:49,528
Those guys who sell stuff.

699
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:51,529
That's what he does now.

700
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:57,303
wait. Look..

701
00:44:57,496 --> 00:44:59,169
He gave me this ATM card.

702
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,202
I can withdraw any amount I want.

703
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:03,803
But I don't need it.

704
00:45:04,303 --> 00:45:06,476
See, last month he sent this TV.

705
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,485
It's too thin,
but the image's really clear.

706
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:11,211
And this fan too.

707
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,049
Even in a slow speed,
you feel cold in minutes.

708
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:16,387
But where is he these days?

709
00:45:16,682 --> 00:45:18,218
In Lucknow.

710
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,895
Patrakarpuram.

711
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:21,898
Thank you.
Have some cashews, son.

712
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,064
Take it.

713
00:45:23,122 --> 00:45:25,830
Let's go, you glutton.
I eat every day, son.

714
00:45:26,425 --> 00:45:28,234
That's enough, son...

715
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:32,840
Thank you.

716
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:35,177
Why?

717
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:36,844
For every thing, you're doing.

718
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:41,541
Why are you doing it?

719
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:50,792
Climb aboard, brother.
You've got our tickets.

720
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:54,262
Good bye.

721
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,962
See you later.

722
00:45:57,189 --> 00:45:59,191
See you later.
Brother, the train's leaving.

723
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:00,793
Take care of yourself.

724
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,943
Now, according to
Vidrohi's mother...

725
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,417
'...he's this successful.

726
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:16,747
And that's not all, sir.

727
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,184
This 400 N/M beast comes
with six airbags, ABS...

728
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,247
...which is your Anti
Lock Braking system.

729
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,054
Fraction control...

730
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,424
Well, if you ask me
I think this is your car.

731
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,728
Good.

732
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:31,128
I think we'll take it.
Okay.

733
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,333
Pack the blue one.

734
00:46:33,425 --> 00:46:35,632
But the reality is...

735
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,001
Pack the blue one.

736
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:39,170
Show that one..
Take a look, sister-in-law.

737
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:40,910
This comes with a blouse-piece
attached to it.

738
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,210
There is two types of fading in this sari.
Really.

739
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:44,503
Front and back.

740
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,110
See.

741
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,076
In fact, it's got extensive
intricate work done on the borders.

742
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,812
Sales Manager is selling saris.

743
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:52,445
Should I order tea or something else?
No.

744
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:53,946
Do come again.
Sure.

745
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:56,583
Congratulations for your wedding, brother.
Come on.

746
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:04,390
Brother, do you have anything in Chanderi?
Yes, we...

747
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:07,059
Unbelievable, dude...

748
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:09,565
You're selling saris in an age where
you should be taking them off.

749
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:13,471
Brother, you...

750
00:47:13,632 --> 00:47:15,634
What are you doing here?

751
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:19,543
Order some Cola and
we'll talk in detail.

752
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,658
So you won't come along?

753
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:32,556
No, brother.

754
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:37,961
Because of you... I lost my degree,
fled from my city.

755
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,732
I cannot afford to lose this job now.

756
00:47:42,828 --> 00:47:45,035
Pritam, who's going
to look after the customers?

757
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,131
get back inside.

758
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:51,244
We have a huge variety in Chanderi.

759
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,077
Look at the borders,
it's got a beautiful border.

760
00:47:54,573 --> 00:47:56,018
You can get these in different colors.

761
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,919
I'm telling you,
brother, I cannot do this.

762
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:03,386
Look, brother, I've found
true love almost a decade later.

763
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:06,158
But the girl loves the
author of Bareilly ki Barfi...

764
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,061
...and according to the book,
that's you.

765
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:10,259
That's really nice.

766
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:12,696
You created this problem,
now it's come back to haunt you.

767
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:15,295
Brother, you got to explain
him the way he understands best.

768
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:16,634
Listen...

769
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,767
The girl wants to meet you once.

770
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:20,275
Meet her. Break her heart.

771
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:21,276
I will make mine
Then get lost.

772
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,040
You find your way.
I'll find my way.

773
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:27,339
Yes... this is the border.
It's very nice.

774
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,751
Don't mind brother,
but can I say something...

775
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:33,088
Everything that happened
with me in the last five years...

776
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:34,714
...did it make any difference to you?

777
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:37,690
So, now I don't care whether
your heart break or aches.

778
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:39,090
Look, bro...

779
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,622
If I am heartbroken,
then so will be your mother.

780
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,124
Why mother?

781
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:48,329
When your mother finds out
that his dear, beloved, son is a liar.

782
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:52,307
And sells saris to women,
by draping them on his body.

783
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:53,808
She will be heartbroken.

784
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:55,739
Right, Munna?
Yes, brother.

785
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:57,706
She won't stop waiting.

786
00:49:00,872 --> 00:49:04,183
This isn't right... it's blackmail.

787
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,688
Correct answer. And, you win a
gift voucher from your own shop.

788
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:11,158
Brother!

789
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,363
<i>Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

790
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:17,366
<i>The kid has turned stylish
and will now be menacing.</i>

791
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:20,461
<i>With time his coolness
keeps oh so increasing.</i>

792
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,167
<i>Coolness keeps oh so increasing.</i>

793
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:29,343
Bitti hates chauvinists
men and bullies.

794
00:49:29,935 --> 00:49:32,438
She's right...
they are worth being hated.

795
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,312
Always bullying people around.

796
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:38,388
You must become like them.

797
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:41,757
What?
<i>The kid has turned stylish...</i>

798
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:43,588
Brother, this is one's too tight.
<i>...and will now he menacing.</i>

799
00:49:43,682 --> 00:49:46,288
<i>With time his coolness
keeps oh so increasing.</i>

800
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:48,956
<i>The simple guy's
good time sure has come.</i>

801
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:50,499
<i>His super smart ways will now...</i>
Yes Bro..

802
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,091
<i>...get the whole world watching.</i>
Hey Bro...

803
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,932
I can't do that.

804
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,433
He cannot do it, brother.
Listen to me...

805
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,337
I am right here to teach you.

806
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,165
Yes, but...

807
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:06,576
You know what,
just take me the way I am.

808
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:09,513
No one likes me anyway,
except for my mother.

809
00:50:09,608 --> 00:50:11,019
She won't either.

810
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:12,578
Let's do that.

811
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:14,415
We can't take a chance now.

812
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:16,221
With style more than
he himself could handle.

813
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:17,851
Keep this.
It's for me, brother.

814
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:19,461
Lets go.

815
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:22,322
Give it here... Leave.
Bro, gave it to me.

816
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,624
Should it take the call.

817
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:27,134
Yes, brother Chirag.

818
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,669
Curb your emotions.

819
00:50:30,629 --> 00:50:32,006
Say it with altitude.

820
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:35,236
Who is this speaking?

821
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:36,937
I'll throw this sweet
corn soup on your head.

822
00:50:38,003 --> 00:50:39,448
Who is speaking?

823
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,941
You call me.

824
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:44,652
My prepaid balance is low.

825
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,292
Brother...

826
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:57,497
Take your lime.

827
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:01,135
Hello...

828
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:04,532
Go on...

829
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:07,906
His altitude has no boundaries,
no barriers.

830
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:12,072
Everyone better get in his good
books before he gets even bigger.

831
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:13,448
Hello...

832
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,348
Y... Go on...

833
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:19,680
<i>Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

834
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,588
<i>Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

835
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:25,719
<i>I'm not the swag...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

836
00:51:25,784 --> 00:51:29,231
<i>Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

837
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:34,268
<i>Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

838
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,440
<i>Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

839
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:40,507
<i>Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).</i>

840
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:43,004
Don't try to act too smart.

841
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:45,111
Otherwise...

842
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:51,254
Let's imagine someone's
calling you from the back.

843
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,650
How will you look?

844
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:57,254
You mean, with altitude.
Yes.

845
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:00,993
Call me once.

846
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,630
Munna.

847
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,428
Vidrohi.

848
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:09,333
Vidrohi.

849
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:12,440
Vidrohi!

850
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,609
Bullies never look back.

851
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:17,703
Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).

852
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:20,909
Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).

853
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:24,044
I'm not the swag...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).

854
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:27,488
Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).

855
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:29,920
So time for your final lest.

856
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,487
What are you saying?
This is Lucknow.

857
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:34,995
People shoot at first
sight and think later.

858
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,330
And I don't like sour betel-leaf.

859
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,866
But you must today.

860
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,066
I'll get one for you.

861
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,660
What do you think,
we're on a morning walk?

862
00:52:43,028 --> 00:52:44,439
get on your bike.

863
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:49,435
Take a long run-up...
and speed away like a bullet.

864
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:50,569
Come on.

865
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:55,251
Lift the stand.

866
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,150
What do you think? Can he do it?

867
00:53:16,428 --> 00:53:17,338
Here.

868
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,406
Hey bro, why are you parking
in the middle of the road?

869
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:30,042
Who the hell is he?
Move your bike.

870
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:33,450
Move it... are you deaf?

871
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:36,286
One sweet betel leaf.
Listen.

872
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,952
Move your bike. What a strange guy.

873
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,030
Parked his bike in the middle.
Hey Hero...

874
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:42,227
Hey man... you.

875
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,362
How much?

876
00:53:43,455 --> 00:53:44,695
10 Rs.

877
00:53:44,856 --> 00:53:47,200
Move your bike,
We can't move our car.

878
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:49,329
Come on.

879
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:51,803
Move your bike.

880
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:55,107
get lost with your bike.

881
00:53:56,034 --> 00:53:57,240
Do you think you own the road?

882
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:58,506
Move your bike.

883
00:54:00,038 --> 00:54:02,518
Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).

884
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,921
Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy).

885
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:09,220
The kid has turned stylish
and will now he menacing.

886
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:12,260
With time his coolness
keeps oh so increasing.

887
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:15,126
The simple guy's good
time sure has come.

888
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,599
His super smart ways will
now get the whole world watching.

889
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,097
There's a power cut
in the entire city...

890
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,161
...but it will be
restored soon enough.

891
00:54:23,295 --> 00:54:24,535
We regret the inconvenience caused.

892
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,302
It's me.

893
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:29,334
Is your phone in the
Lost and found department.

894
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:30,605
No.

895
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,947
Oh! The battery's dead.

896
00:54:34,673 --> 00:54:36,619
Well, let me recharge you.

897
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:38,014
Hold my hand.

898
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,821
I've found Vidrohi?

899
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:42,057
Are you serious?

900
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:45,551
How is he?
See for yourself.

901
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:46,590
Lets go.

902
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,593
I'm bringing him along.

903
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:52,326
Great, see you tomorrow.

904
00:54:54,192 --> 00:54:56,638
Gopal, get me some tea.

905
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:02,505
One is not a schemer
and other is not a bully.

906
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,810
But, strange are the ways of love.

907
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:06,813
'One's hatching schemes...

908
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:08,575
...and, the other is
emerging with an attitude.

909
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,748
Yellow suits you.

910
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:12,786
This one?
No.

911
00:55:13,578 --> 00:55:17,458
You're acting more
snooty than a heroine.

912
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,358
The one you're wearing also looks nice.
Be quiet.

913
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:21,964
This?
Blue buttons don't suit you.

914
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,897
It's from your shop.
Boutique.

915
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:24,967
Right, boutique.

916
00:55:25,023 --> 00:55:27,299
Your phone's ringing.

917
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:28,893
Hello Madam,

918
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:30,931
You haven't left yet?

919
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:31,870
I'm just leaving.

920
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:33,341
You're really unbelievable.

921
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:35,378
You took four days to find Mr.
Vidrohi.

922
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,776
I can at least take
2 hours to get ready right!

923
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,275
Let him wait, I am coming.

924
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:40,349
Okay.

925
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:42,949
She'll be here any minute.

926
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:48,152
I'll be fine... but, isn't this too much?
No.

927
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:49,983
Just remember what I said.

928
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:53,325
And, brother... my voice...

929
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,259
From the stomach...

930
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,400
Like Mr. Bachchan.
Hello.

931
00:55:59,157 --> 00:56:00,192
Hello.

932
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,100
Name, what was her name?

933
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:04,364
Bitti.
Bitti...

934
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:06,736
Dimwit... don't foil the plan.

935
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:09,172
I will try my best.

936
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:13,215
This is it.
We've arrived.

937
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,077
She's here.

938
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,617
Hi.

939
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,122
Hello.

940
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:24,989
It's me...

941
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,497
Now just repeat after me.

942
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,130
What can I do?

943
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,462
Tell him it's Vidrohi's work.

944
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:33,794
Who? Vidrohi!

945
00:56:33,992 --> 00:56:36,063
If he still doesn't listen,
give him one tight slap.

946
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:39,800
And don't call me again
for such trivial mailers.

947
00:56:40,198 --> 00:56:41,575
Hang up...

948
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,940
So, what was your name?
Guddi?

949
00:56:47,105 --> 00:56:49,847
Which one is Guddi?
Its Bitti. I'm Bitti.

950
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,681
Bitti, right.

951
00:56:51,943 --> 00:56:55,356
Rama. Best friend.
Best?

952
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,015
wait a minute,
how could you not recognize me.

953
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,627
I sent you my photo.
Photo.

954
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:01,422
Yeah, I sent my photo
along with the letter.

955
00:57:01,486 --> 00:57:02,794
Letter?

956
00:57:03,288 --> 00:57:05,165
The one in the sari.
Sari?

957
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:09,361
Yes...
Right, your photo...

958
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:12,842
Say something.
So many people send their pictures.

959
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:15,411
He's a public figure.
Yeah.

960
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:19,373
Hey..

961
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:21,280
Son, come here.

962
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:24,651
Yes, sir.

963
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:25,877
What will you have?

964
00:57:26,244 --> 00:57:27,450
What, sir?

965
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:30,156
Who's going to ask
what we'll have, huh?

966
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,090
Sorry, sir.
What will you have?

967
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:33,828
Chow-mien for everyone.

968
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:36,195
Okay, sir.
No, we're leaving.

969
00:57:36,354 --> 00:57:38,129
Okay.
But, you just got here.

970
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:41,336
We need to take Rama's
brother to the doctor.

971
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:44,501
We do, don't we?

972
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:46,299
Yes.
So get up.

973
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:46,774
Lets go.

974
00:57:46,898 --> 00:57:48,707
Invite him for lunch tomorrow.
Why?

975
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:49,638
It's a Sunday.

976
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:51,576
You can introduce Mr.
Vidrohi to your parents.

977
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:56,513
It's a Sunday.
Fine, I'll meet her parents.

978
00:57:56,608 --> 00:57:57,814
Okay, Bye...

979
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:00,517
By the way, you write really nicely.

980
00:58:00,712 --> 00:58:02,089
You look really nice.

981
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,557
Thank you.
Lets go.

982
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:10,422
Okay...
You were amazing.

983
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:12,634
And the waiter...
They are coming back.

984
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:15,597
Fine, then get going.

985
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:17,636
What's wrong?
Don't feel like leaving?

986
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:18,968
Sit down and eat.

987
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:21,100
No, Thank-you, I had left my purse.
Okay.

988
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:22,777
Wait, wait...

989
00:58:23,735 --> 00:58:24,975
I'll see you out.
No...

990
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,446
Come on.
Let him go along.

991
00:58:26,538 --> 00:58:28,540
Let's go.
Okay, bye.

992
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:37,292
So arrogant.

993
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:39,428
I wanted to slap him.

994
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,458
Which one is Guddi?

995
00:58:41,786 --> 00:58:42,992
Who does he think he is,
Guddi's uncle.

996
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,964
He wasn't that had though...

997
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,729
Every successful
man is a bit arrogant.

998
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:49,499
Tell me...

999
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,673
Have you ever heard a beggar say...

1000
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:56,208
Spare me some change...
or get lost.

1001
00:58:56,434 --> 00:58:57,242
Have you?

1002
00:58:57,435 --> 00:58:59,142
Wise guy's has even self invited
home tomorrow.

1003
00:59:00,505 --> 00:59:03,076
Listen, I am coming too.

1004
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:06,022
You're having this special interest?

1005
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:08,289
I like him.

1006
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,252
I am warning you...

1007
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:13,428
If he tries to act smart tomorrow...
Then you can slap him.

1008
00:59:13,785 --> 00:59:15,355
Let him come home first.

1009
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:17,427
What do you think?

1010
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:18,830
We'll see...

1011
00:59:22,794 --> 00:59:26,469
Brother, when sister-in-law
is over Vidrohi...

1012
00:59:26,531 --> 00:59:28,738
...then why give her another dose.

1013
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,113
Every antibiotic needs
to be taken for three days.

1014
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:34,546
The effect is never
seen in the first dose.

1015
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:37,077
If you don't complete the course...

1016
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:39,655
...then, there's a chance
of the sickness coming back.

1017
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:44,417
You mean, the next
two doses are her parents.

1018
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:48,995
Why did you get this sari?

1019
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,896
My mother always says never
go to any house without a gift.

1020
00:59:52,991 --> 00:59:54,868
You're not going there as a suitor.

1021
00:59:55,526 --> 00:59:57,028
Fine, then you can give her this.

1022
00:59:57,228 --> 00:59:58,730
You bought it, so you give it.

1023
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,134
In fact, you can drape
it on yourself as well.

1024
01:00:00,298 --> 01:00:02,574
See sister-in-law... it's got
three different kinds of shades.

1025
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:04,773
Front and back...

1026
01:00:05,003 --> 01:00:06,778
Fine, pack it.

1027
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:11,212
And no need to make a feast.

1028
01:00:11,476 --> 01:00:12,853
He's not coming over
to ask for marriage.

1029
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:17,383
Dear daughter! I am not so lucky, that a
guy will meet and ask you for marriage.

1030
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:18,653
Don't keep your hopes high.

1031
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:21,628
I am going to stay right here, dancing
on your head for the rest of your life.

1032
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,366
Go take a look, must be Chirag.

1033
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:28,827
I'll go answer the door.
I'm going to call Rama.

1034
01:00:33,765 --> 01:00:35,836
Hello uncle.
Bless you, son. And, who are you?

1035
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,604
Come in, uncle.
This is your home only, isn't it?

1036
01:00:37,936 --> 01:00:39,609
Come in... don't be shy.

1037
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:41,975
Why would I be shy?
Hello, uncle.

1038
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,712
First, you touched my feet
and now you're greeting me again?

1039
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,481
That's me.
It's him.

1040
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,714
Hello, aunty.
Hello, son.

1041
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,654
Chirag, who is he?
He's my friend.

1042
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:49,987
Papa, that's Mr. Vidrohi.

1043
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:52,022
Remember I told you about
him yesterday.

1044
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:54,854
So he's this guy who
wrote that absurd book.

1045
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:56,592
I'm sure you liked it.

1046
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,027
Happy birthday, Whenever it is!

1047
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,431
Chanderi.

1048
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,430
What would you like to have, son?

1049
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:07,475
Buttermilk, juice, tea, coffee.
I'll have tea, aunty, hot.

1050
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:09,606
And you'll have juice only!
Yes.

1051
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:16,108
Vidrohi, do you write to make
a living, or is it just a hobby.

1052
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:19,987
With the grace of Goddess,
I've enough money...

1053
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:23,024
...to buy your shop
and gift it back to you.

1054
01:01:23,214 --> 01:01:27,162
Me?
Writing is just a hobby.

1055
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:29,762
What's wrong with your neck?

1056
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:31,859
This body has grown old son...

1057
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,970
It always needs some repair or other.

1058
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:37,767
Just last week he
was cured of his piles.

1059
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:39,068
It's nothing serious, uncle.

1060
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,132
Add some basil seeds in
water and drink it at night.

1061
01:01:41,232 --> 01:01:43,803
It will fix your all your problems.
Those things don't work.

1062
01:01:44,102 --> 01:01:45,911
Allow me.
No... no...

1063
01:01:46,004 --> 01:01:46,982
Don't do Vidrohi.

1064
01:01:47,105 --> 01:01:48,982
Let me...
Let it be.

1065
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:51,108
Don't break his neck instead.

1066
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:54,353
Leave me.
What are you doing?

1067
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:56,350
Quiet!

1068
01:01:59,083 --> 01:01:59,891
Hold this.

1069
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,186
Hail Bajrang Bali!

1070
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:03,162
Be gentle, son.

1071
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:05,398
One..

1072
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,695
Two... three... done.

1073
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:09,827
Papa, are you alright?

1074
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:11,338
Bitti, Shall I turn?

1075
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:12,737
Yes turn.
Careful.

1076
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:20,975
Wow! I can see everything
from the loo to Sushila.

1077
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:23,348
Bitti, I can even
see the pots behind me.

1078
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:24,509
Wow.

1079
01:02:25,176 --> 01:02:28,487
Since when did you start doing this?
Just now.

1080
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,156
Your father's my first customer.

1081
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:31,693
Hello... call now.
Bitti...

1082
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,351
...give him 10-20 rupees
as a token of appreciation.

1083
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:35,859
Give him money.
Uncle, I have a lot of money.

1084
01:02:35,987 --> 01:02:39,400
Are you married, son?
No, aunty.

1085
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:41,067
I knew it.

1086
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:42,533
Answer the phone.

1087
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:46,131
Hold on.

1088
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:48,909
Hello.

1089
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,935
Listen...
You listen up.

1090
01:02:51,669 --> 01:02:53,376
Next time if you call me...

1091
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:56,546
...I'll kick you so hard,
you'll get a dimple on your a**

1092
01:02:57,809 --> 01:02:58,981
Hang on now.

1093
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,280
Hot...

1094
01:03:01,045 --> 01:03:02,422
The tea is hot, son.

1095
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:05,321
We'll be leaving, aunty.
Okay, son. You can leave.

1096
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:08,821
But you stay, son. I won't let
you go without having lunch.

1097
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,526
I really like you, son.
Okay.

1098
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:13,392
Eat.

1099
01:03:13,491 --> 01:03:15,937
They are very famous, taste it.
I know.

1100
01:03:18,396 --> 01:03:19,602
In a brief moment...

1101
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:25,244
'...he turned papa's neck straight,
and turned the game around.

1102
01:03:27,472 --> 01:03:30,146
I told you... send him back.

1103
01:03:30,408 --> 01:03:32,684
But you wanted to complete the course.

1104
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:34,021
Now it's an overdose.

1105
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:35,857
That was too much man!

1106
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:38,859
Were you trying to be a hero?

1107
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,427
I did exactly like you taught me.

1108
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,067
And, what were you
saying on the phone?

1109
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:49,103
You'll make a dimple on my a**
No, I...

1110
01:03:49,227 --> 01:03:52,868
I was only sticking to my character.

1111
01:03:53,097 --> 01:03:57,136
My performance will go weak
if you keep changing the script.

1112
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:59,608
Why did you have to
fix her father's neck?

1113
01:04:01,706 --> 01:04:03,447
An old man was in pain...

1114
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:06,120
...so I thought I should fix his neck.

1115
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,085
He is your father-in-law after all.

1116
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,224
I was just helping you out.
Mr. Helping hand...

1117
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:13,522
You were supposed to depress her,
but you've impressed her instead.

1118
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:18,225
Fine, I'll go back then.

1119
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:20,233
Right, go on...
You cannot leave like this.

1120
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:23,134
You must first clean
up the mess you have made.

1121
01:04:33,504 --> 01:04:35,484
This new hairstyle really suits you.

1122
01:04:35,773 --> 01:04:36,843
Have another one.
No...

1123
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:38,351
Take it.
I don't want it.

1124
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,516
I've been eating since morning.

1125
01:04:41,846 --> 01:04:43,689
You must eat properly.

1126
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:46,860
You've become so scrawny.

1127
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:51,259
Will a wedding dress
look nice on this body?

1128
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:58,407
All the faults are with me, right mom?

1129
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:03,406
You can wear my wedding dress.

1130
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:09,815
Uncle.
Yes dear.

1131
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:17,187
Mr. Vidrohi.

1132
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:23,693
Bitti, at this hour?

1133
01:05:23,888 --> 01:05:26,994
Yeah... If papa doesn't eat a sweet
betel-leaf after dinner he gets bitter.

1134
01:05:27,158 --> 01:05:28,136
What are you doing here?

1135
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:30,205
Well... I have a similar habit.

1136
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:33,104
If I don't eat a dessert
after dinner I get bitter too.

1137
01:05:33,531 --> 01:05:34,703
I see...

1138
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:36,874
You should eat more sweets...

1139
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:38,770
It will cure your bitterness.

1140
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:42,348
Am I that bitter?
No...

1141
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,277
...but, you're not like
I thought you would be.

1142
01:05:45,343 --> 01:05:46,720
I mean, Rama and me.

1143
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:51,858
What did you and Rama think?

1144
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:56,397
You see... your letters were filled
with the fragrance of romance.

1145
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:58,861
But you turned out to
he the fragrance of bullies.

1146
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:00,368
So I...

1147
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,862
Don't get me wrong.

1148
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:04,864
You're not that bad person.

1149
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:14,581
It's the conditions
That make people bad.

1150
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,641
You are right.

1151
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,651
It's the conditions and
people who made me bitter.

1152
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:24,816
But even bitter people have a...

1153
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:25,858
Huh?

1154
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:30,128
Heart and it's not bitter at all.

1155
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:32,494
Bitti...

1156
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:38,237
Vidrohi, Are you okay.

1157
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:44,075
Sweetmeat...

1158
01:06:45,503 --> 01:06:46,573
Make that two.

1159
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:55,222
You didn't tell me...
did you like Vidrohi?

1160
01:06:55,346 --> 01:06:56,188
You never asked.

1161
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,489
From the time he is here
you don't even miss me.

1162
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:03,960
You could've at least called.
You could've too.

1163
01:07:04,655 --> 01:07:06,896
Yes, I could.
So...

1164
01:07:07,892 --> 01:07:10,839
So tell me, how did you like Vidrohi?

1165
01:07:11,629 --> 01:07:13,905
You know, when we met first...

1166
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:16,170
...I wanted to claw his face.
I knew it.

1167
01:07:16,267 --> 01:07:18,577
No... but, when he came home...

1168
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,544
...I realized, he's not that bad.

1169
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:22,876
And, mom and dad
are completely floored.

1170
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:25,145
I see...

1171
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:27,153
So, what's the plan?

1172
01:07:27,745 --> 01:07:28,746
What's the plan?

1173
01:07:28,913 --> 01:07:30,085
We've just met twice.

1174
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:32,285
We'll first get to know each other.

1175
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,721
Meet few more times.

1176
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,322
You've met me many times.

1177
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,301
So?
What do you think about me?

1178
01:07:41,926 --> 01:07:42,904
What's to think?

1179
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,062
That you're my very good friend.

1180
01:07:45,863 --> 01:07:48,639
No one does what you did for me.

1181
01:07:50,468 --> 01:07:53,074
She just friend-zoned me.
They are here.

1182
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:56,574
You're here.

1183
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,675
Brother...

1184
01:07:58,342 --> 01:08:00,447
Vidrohi, Remember we
must close this chapter today.

1185
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:02,922
I've by-hearted everything,
brother, don't worry.

1186
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:06,061
How are you?
Great.

1187
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:07,184
Hello.

1188
01:08:08,786 --> 01:08:11,790
We're early.
You're half an hour late.

1189
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,626
This place is for boozing at night.

1190
01:08:14,692 --> 01:08:16,103
And you guys are eating groundnuts.

1191
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,662
Yeah, right.
looking at the way you drink...

1192
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,536
...you would hardly have any
place in your stomach for groundnuts.

1193
01:08:20,231 --> 01:08:21,733
You're absolutely right.

1194
01:08:22,733 --> 01:08:25,270
This is exactly what I say
to myself every night when I drink.

1195
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,746
And forget in the morning.

1196
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:31,308
He's also got memory loss.
Yeah...

1197
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:34,986
Oh yes...

1198
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,820
And I've also been to jail
once because of this mix-up.

1199
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:38,824
I see...

1200
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:42,396
Oh, God... jail... criminal...
this is really serious.

1201
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:43,863
It's nothing serious.

1202
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:46,132
Lord Krishna was also born in a jail.

1203
01:08:46,824 --> 01:08:48,997
And, one should not
remember everything.

1204
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,664
Wow...

1205
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:55,372
What if I forget you tomorrow?

1206
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:58,173
It's not that easy
to forget Bitti Mishra.

1207
01:08:58,469 --> 01:08:59,675
Let's make a bet.

1208
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:01,773
And you'll definitely not forget
me until tomorrow.

1209
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,284
What is there tomorrow?
What?

1210
01:09:03,374 --> 01:09:05,376
How can you forget?
You printed all those pamphlets.

1211
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:08,318
Golden Jubilee Celebrations
of Lovely Sweets.

1212
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:12,317
How can you not come?
He can't come.

1213
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:14,487
Why not?
He's leaving for Lucknow tonight.

1214
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:16,656
Bagh Express... Northern Railway.

1215
01:09:16,754 --> 01:09:18,131
Happy journey.
But...

1216
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:22,805
Going back... Yeah, I'm going back.

1217
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,534
How can he come?
He's leaving, he can't come.

1218
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:28,666
Hold this. Show me the ticket.

1219
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:32,373
I see...

1220
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,242
And, what if it gets torn?

1221
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,983
No, no, Bitti...

1222
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,245
No, Bitti...

1223
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:41,755
I swear I'll never talk to you again.
Return the ticket.

1224
01:09:41,946 --> 01:09:43,789
Tell her.
Yeah, I won't either.

1225
01:09:43,814 --> 01:09:45,816
No chance.
Fine, leave.

1226
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:47,828
Give me your phone.

1227
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:49,295
I'm low on balance.

1228
01:09:49,487 --> 01:09:52,661
Delete my number, and I will too.

1229
01:09:53,057 --> 01:09:54,161
Because you're leaving.

1230
01:09:54,225 --> 01:09:55,670
Go on...
Great.

1231
01:09:55,826 --> 01:09:59,035
So Mr. Vidrohi,
you've to pack your bags and.

1232
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:00,866
Lets go.
Brother, keys.

1233
01:10:02,233 --> 01:10:05,077
Don't be sad, Bitti.
Doesn't matter.

1234
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:05,943
Please, leave.

1235
01:10:06,003 --> 01:10:08,108
This is no time to get emotional,
Vidrohi.

1236
01:10:09,173 --> 01:10:11,813
I had a hard time getting
this ticket through VVIP quota.

1237
01:10:11,842 --> 01:10:13,219
With recommendations from Mr. Bishnoi.

1238
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:16,757
Let's go.
Bitti...

1239
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:19,558
No... the trains are packed.

1240
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,195
'Vidrohi's revolt... Fantastic.

1241
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:28,336
I can't go back breaking your heart.

1242
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:32,339
But soon he was hit...
I mean got ditched.

1243
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,274
You cannot leave Bitti.
Listen to me.

1244
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,707
You tore up the ticket.

1245
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,712
I like Rama, Brother. If I die,
Bitti won't wait for 14 years.

1246
01:10:41,872 --> 01:10:42,873
Just kill him.

1247
01:10:42,973 --> 01:10:44,953
I like Rama.

1248
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,659
I like Rama.

1249
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:55,462
Bitti's my sister-in-law.

1250
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:59,297
The question is whether
Rama likes you too.

1251
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,668
Don't know.

1252
01:11:01,325 --> 01:11:03,601
But I tore up the ticket to find out.

1253
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:06,505
I'll stay here for another
week and lest her.

1254
01:11:06,897 --> 01:11:09,878
If she's the one for me,
then we'll leave together.

1255
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:12,971
Sorry.
Huh!

1256
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,478
Sorry.

1257
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:17,517
There's water in this ear,
say it in this one.

1258
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:21,082
Sorry.
Fritters...

1259
01:11:21,145 --> 01:11:23,557
Yes 'Lorry'

1260
01:11:23,681 --> 01:11:27,493
OK now you focus all
your attention on Rama.

1261
01:11:27,685 --> 01:11:30,063
Okay.
I will support you in this love story.

1262
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:33,968
Buy a really nice gift for Rama.

1263
01:11:34,091 --> 01:11:36,230
There's no need for this.
It's love after all.

1264
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,828
I've told you a thousand times...

1265
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:38,896
...don't bathe at night.

1266
01:11:38,963 --> 01:11:40,806
See aunty,
He took a bath with his clothes on.

1267
01:11:52,543 --> 01:11:56,150
<i>Abracadabra...
my beloved's so handsome.</i>

1268
01:11:56,213 --> 01:11:59,592
<i>Always dressed smartly,
whether it's Delhi or Agra.</i>

1269
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:03,187
<i>Your earrings make
my heart skip a beat.</i>

1270
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,166
<i>When you shake the waist,
it steals millions of hearts.</i>

1271
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:18,004
<i>Your earrings make
my heart skip a beat.</i>

1272
01:12:18,102 --> 01:12:21,675
<i>When you shake the waist,
it steals millions of hearts.</i>

1273
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:23,581
<i>Stop taunting me...</i>

1274
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:25,416
<i>Don't be a wise guy.</i>

1275
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:27,182
<i>I am not Juliet,</i>

1276
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:29,689
<i>And you're not my Romeo.</i>

1277
01:12:31,182 --> 01:12:34,220
<i>O Sweety...</i>

1278
01:12:34,552 --> 01:12:38,261
<i>O Sweety your drama,
creates a stir.</i>

1279
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:41,962
<i>This is unfair.</i>

1280
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:45,699
<i>Believe it or not,
we're crazy about you...</i>

1281
01:12:45,763 --> 01:12:49,233
<i>Listen O,
sweetheart, we're your beloved.</i>

1282
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,108
<i>...DJ..</i>

1283
01:12:52,503 --> 01:12:53,447
<i>Crazy.</i>

1284
01:13:04,181 --> 01:13:05,956
<i>Don't make a commotion...</i>

1285
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:07,825
<i>...everyone's watching.</i>

1286
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:11,526
<i>What do you get from making a scene.</i>

1287
01:13:11,622 --> 01:13:15,195
<i>Don't ignore me...
I am not useless.</i>

1288
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:18,603
<i>Teach me the language of love.</i>

1289
01:13:18,929 --> 01:13:20,806
<i>Stop taunting me...</i>

1290
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,707
<i>Don't be a wise guy.</i>

1291
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,507
<i>I am not your Juliet,</i>

1292
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,911
<i>And you're not my Romeo.</i>

1293
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:31,476
<i>O Sweety...</i>

1294
01:13:31,809 --> 01:13:35,586
<i>O Sweety your drama, creates a stir.</i>

1295
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,252
<i>This is unfair.</i>

1296
01:13:39,349 --> 01:13:42,922
<i>Believe it or not,
we're crazy about you...</i>

1297
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,866
<i>Listen o sweetheart,
we're your beloved.</i>

1298
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:05,278
<i>Abracadabra... my
beloved's so handsome.</i>

1299
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:08,845
<i>Always dressed smartly,
whether it's Delhi or Agra.</i>

1300
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:09,981
Bravo, Mr. Mishra.

1301
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:13,488
The Pukhraj-gem has
started to show effect.

1302
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,624
We were trying to
find one suitor for Bitti...

1303
01:14:17,154 --> 01:14:18,497
...but, now we found two.

1304
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:21,166
Now, choose what you want.

1305
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:25,437
And, it's not like we've
to choose between good or bad.

1306
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:30,676
One's good and the
other's slightly better.

1307
01:14:31,368 --> 01:14:32,972
Both are well suited.

1308
01:14:33,504 --> 01:14:36,849
That's the problem.
Who do we choose?

1309
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,513
Right?

1310
01:14:44,615 --> 01:14:47,789
On one side, Mr. Vidrohi was
making his impression

1311
01:14:48,052 --> 01:14:51,693
...while on the other Mr.
Chirag was breaking his head.

1312
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:56,001
Hello, aunty.
Hello, hello.

1313
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,504
Your spectacles were broken,
weren't they? I got it fixed.

1314
01:15:02,766 --> 01:15:04,837
That's a big help, son.

1315
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:08,213
It's hard to read anything without it.

1316
01:15:09,106 --> 01:15:11,211
Everything's so clear now.

1317
01:15:14,044 --> 01:15:17,582
Son, you care so much for everyone.

1318
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:21,763
Can I say something?
Please do.

1319
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:24,960
I've been thinking about
something for the past few days.

1320
01:15:26,457 --> 01:15:28,528
About Bitti's marriage.

1321
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,966
Oh, Aunty,
Bitti is a really nice girl.

1322
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:33,008
She will get married sooner or later,
don't worry.

1323
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,368
Yeah...

1324
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:37,712
Actually, I already know
who's best groom for her.

1325
01:15:39,403 --> 01:15:41,212
I will convince Bitti...

1326
01:15:41,805 --> 01:15:43,478
And you...
What?

1327
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:45,920
You convince Vidrohi.

1328
01:15:51,315 --> 01:15:55,195
Vidrohi... for Bitti?
Yes.

1329
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:59,028
Did Bitti say that?
She doesn't have to.

1330
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:01,565
They look like a match made in heaven.

1331
01:16:01,825 --> 01:16:03,771
You just be like God Hanuman

1332
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:06,433
...and take this burden off my chest.

1333
01:16:06,597 --> 01:16:09,373
When a lover feels
the storm in the sea.

1334
01:16:09,499 --> 01:16:11,945
'...he finds different ways to
to save himself from loosing his love.

1335
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:14,447
What happened?
What can I say, aunty?

1336
01:16:16,173 --> 01:16:18,449
Vidrohi is a divorcee.
Huh?

1337
01:16:19,443 --> 01:16:20,353
Hmm...

1338
01:16:24,982 --> 01:16:27,428
Brother Chirag.
This way, Vidrohi.

1339
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:28,952
Brother...

1340
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:31,795
What's wrong?
Why did you call me suddenly?

1341
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:34,157
What's happening, isn't good for you.

1342
01:16:34,992 --> 01:16:36,733
What happened now?

1343
01:16:38,395 --> 01:16:40,898
That seed of love,
you sowed in Rama's heart...

1344
01:16:41,165 --> 01:16:42,610
...was reaped by someone else.

1345
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,440
What do you mean?
It means...

1346
01:16:44,534 --> 01:16:46,411
Someone came to see Rama yesterday.

1347
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,381
And they really liked Rama a lot.

1348
01:16:48,572 --> 01:16:49,573
Liked her?

1349
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,778
Total.

1350
01:16:52,142 --> 01:16:53,644
Did Rama say yes?

1351
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:55,618
She didn't say no either.

1352
01:16:57,648 --> 01:17:00,458
Who... who is the guy?
Tell me his name.

1353
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,427
There's nothing you can do.

1354
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:04,724
He's a goldsmith,
he's got a shop of his own.

1355
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:08,095
He can melt silver,
and make jewelry for Rama.

1356
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:11,468
Even his security guard makes
more money than you.

1357
01:17:14,698 --> 01:17:16,006
But...

1358
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,405
I've seen love in
Rama's eyes for you.

1359
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:24,241
Yeah... so did I.
In fact, I've seen it more often.

1360
01:17:24,575 --> 01:17:25,952
Honestly?

1361
01:17:28,412 --> 01:17:30,016
So, what should I do, brother?

1362
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:32,893
My advice is that you
should tell her tomorrow.

1363
01:17:33,283 --> 01:17:35,490
Tomorrow is also lucky Wednesday.
Yes.

1364
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,992
I will if you say so.
And, listen...

1365
01:17:40,357 --> 01:17:43,361
Say it in front of everyone.
Why?

1366
01:17:44,862 --> 01:17:46,864
Huh! You only kiss in private.

1367
01:17:47,231 --> 01:17:50,576
...but in front of everyone
you openly express your love.

1368
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:53,442
You're right, brother. I will try.

1369
01:17:53,537 --> 01:17:55,380
And, write down a few lines,
so you can propose to her.

1370
01:17:55,472 --> 01:17:57,315
Have you heard
Altaf Raja's songs?

1371
01:17:57,908 --> 01:17:59,819
You'll get lots of ideas from him.
Okay.

1372
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:01,250
Okay, brother.

1373
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,861
What do you think, brother?
Will Rama say a yes?

1374
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:10,295
Who cares?

1375
01:18:11,655 --> 01:18:14,158
The neighbor's kid
has climbed up the tree.

1376
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:16,266
If he hikes down safely,
we'll get to eat mangoes.

1377
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,795
And, if he falls down and dies,
we'll get to eat at his funeral.

1378
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:21,769
In this situation,
whether Rama says yes or no...

1379
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:24,277
Bitti is sure to get heartbroken.

1380
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:27,110
Can I say something, brother?

1381
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,577
You're such a villain.

1382
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:38,621
This take is where love was born!

1383
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:41,161
The film was called Jawani Diwaani.

1384
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:44,629
Vinod Khanna and Dharmendra
waged a fierce war.

1385
01:18:44,688 --> 01:18:46,599
And the reason was
Hema Malini, mister.

1386
01:18:46,656 --> 01:18:48,636
Say it.
Dream Girl...

1387
01:18:48,692 --> 01:18:52,230
The queen of my dreams...
Dream girl.

1388
01:18:52,963 --> 01:18:55,944
Turn your head that side and
enjoy the view from this side.

1389
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:57,909
Mister.
Yes, mister.

1390
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,010
Can you stay quiet, mister?
Why, mister?

1391
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,014
Would you like one, mister?

1392
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:02,414
Why are you getting angry?

1393
01:19:02,506 --> 01:19:04,042
It was so much fun.

1394
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:07,688
Turn your head that side...
and enjoy the view from this side.

1395
01:19:08,445 --> 01:19:11,085
Mr. Vidrohi wants to say something.
Really...

1396
01:19:11,348 --> 01:19:12,349
speak up...

1397
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:16,260
Don't be shy.

1398
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:19,297
Oh no... I am not shy.

1399
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:23,763
Your heart has stolen my heart.

1400
01:19:23,827 --> 01:19:26,103
And stolen my peace and sleep.

1401
01:19:26,163 --> 01:19:28,006
Don't make any excuses.

1402
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:29,543
I've made up my mind
to make you my wife, Rama.

1403
01:19:29,633 --> 01:19:30,577
Will you marriage me?

1404
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:33,278
Will you marry me?
Will you marriage me?

1405
01:19:45,148 --> 01:19:51,155
Look... Vidrohi, you're a great guy.

1406
01:19:51,922 --> 01:19:55,734
And I like you too.
Thank you.

1407
01:19:56,426 --> 01:20:00,067
But, I cannot marry a divorcee.

1408
01:20:00,564 --> 01:20:04,444
It's against our culture.
You've great values.

1409
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:07,148
Divorcee...

1410
01:20:12,576 --> 01:20:15,648
Hold on... who's a divorcee?
Me...

1411
01:20:15,745 --> 01:20:16,917
Me?

1412
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,118
What are you saying?

1413
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:20,119
I've never even been engaged.

1414
01:20:20,217 --> 01:20:21,924
I mean, I've never even...

1415
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:23,355
You...

1416
01:20:23,453 --> 01:20:25,899
Say something.
What will he say?

1417
01:20:26,056 --> 01:20:28,002
He's the one who told me.

1418
01:20:34,731 --> 01:20:36,711
And that's Suicide Point...

1419
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:40,146
Every year 72 lovers
drown to death here.

1420
01:20:40,237 --> 01:20:41,477
Dreamgirl...

1421
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:43,414
Your game's up, brother!

1422
01:20:43,974 --> 01:20:45,783
And, I will make you pay for this.

1423
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:48,819
You will have to
clean up all this mess.

1424
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:51,557
And you can tag in too.
stay in your limits, okay.

1425
01:20:51,648 --> 01:20:53,150
You mind your limits, understood.

1426
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,862
Or else, I will really kick your a**

1427
01:20:56,153 --> 01:20:56,858
Sit down.

1428
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,228
Slap him, brother.
Shut up.

1429
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:07,004
You've turned my life into a big joke!

1430
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:10,744
I've no place!

1431
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:18,247
I was quietly making
a road for myself.

1432
01:21:18,809 --> 01:21:20,584
But you just ruined everything.

1433
01:21:21,011 --> 01:21:23,321
You made me divorcee...
Quiet!

1434
01:21:23,747 --> 01:21:25,420
Bitti's mother wants
to make you her son-in-law.

1435
01:21:25,482 --> 01:21:27,223
What else could I do? Tell me.

1436
01:21:27,951 --> 01:21:29,430
Helped you instead.

1437
01:21:31,188 --> 01:21:33,668
I did what I thought was
right at that moment, that's it.

1438
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:36,870
What about my heart
that got shattered?

1439
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:38,669
What about that?

1440
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:41,140
Who told you to lock eyes with Rama?

1441
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:44,208
Just help me get my love, and then...

1442
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:46,304
...you can go anywhere you want,
I don't care.

1443
01:21:47,637 --> 01:21:50,345
You... you're such a selfish man.

1444
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:53,682
I mean... you can ruin anyone's
life for the sake of your life.

1445
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,021
I am done with being exploited.

1446
01:21:59,516 --> 01:22:01,996
I tried my best to be your friend.

1447
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:06,130
Now, I will show you.

1448
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,125
Just watch...

1449
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:10,828
Tell me what you can do.

1450
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:12,630
Nothing much.

1451
01:22:13,697 --> 01:22:16,007
I will steal Bitti
from right under your nose.

1452
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:19,612
Just watch.

1453
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:22,745
This hair style I gave
you is really amazing.

1454
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:25,279
But, have you seen
your face in the mirror?

1455
01:22:26,243 --> 01:22:28,018
You can't even woo a boy.

1456
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:31,322
If girls only cared about looks...

1457
01:22:32,182 --> 01:22:34,287
...then half of the boys in India
would've still been bachelors.

1458
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:35,352
Understood.

1459
01:22:36,853 --> 01:22:39,800
I will take away Bitti
from you... it's a dare.

1460
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:42,870
Let's imagine that you
do get married to Bitti...

1461
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:45,832
...then, I'll play the
trumpet at your wedding.

1462
01:22:45,896 --> 01:22:48,103
And I'll decorate the flowers.
Now get lost.

1463
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,779
Better start preparing.

1464
01:22:59,743 --> 01:23:01,984
Brother,
he turned out to be a traitor.

1465
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:03,655
Trying to foil our plans.

1466
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:07,288
Bitti will apply henna on her hands.
Not cow-dung.

1467
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:09,594
There's nothing he can do.

1468
01:23:11,454 --> 01:23:12,489
Aunty, where is Bitti?

1469
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:14,029
She is upstairs.

1470
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:17,997
Chirag, come here. Sit.

1471
01:23:19,596 --> 01:23:23,203
Son, where does Bitti
keep wandering at nights?

1472
01:23:23,934 --> 01:23:26,244
She's a girl after all, not a witch.

1473
01:23:26,536 --> 01:23:28,982
Why don't you talk to her?
Don't worry, aunty.

1474
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:30,309
I'll talk to her.

1475
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:33,147
Just make some tea. Hot...

1476
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,254
Okay.

1477
01:23:39,149 --> 01:23:40,150
How are you, Rama?

1478
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:42,627
It's entirely my fault.

1479
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,323
I shouldn't have brought
that imbecile here.

1480
01:23:44,854 --> 01:23:45,662
All he did was write a book...

1481
01:23:45,722 --> 01:23:46,996
...and now he think's
he's Ghalib (Poet)!

1482
01:23:47,691 --> 01:23:48,863
Thank God, Rama rejected him.

1483
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:50,331
Good for nothing...

1484
01:23:50,861 --> 01:23:52,738
Letters for you...
and proposal for Rama.

1485
01:23:53,129 --> 01:23:54,199
This is not the way.

1486
01:23:55,332 --> 01:23:57,403
You don't have to be sad, Bitti.

1487
01:23:58,969 --> 01:24:00,346
Why would I he sad?

1488
01:24:02,072 --> 01:24:05,383
He's just a divorcee
and not a murderer.

1489
01:24:06,576 --> 01:24:08,647
Maybe she was a h***

1490
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,787
I didn't know Rama
would be such a fool.

1491
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:14,293
And, you're siding with Vidrohi instead.
What else?

1492
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:16,963
Humiliate him like Rama did.
How can you say that?

1493
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,363
Do you know everything that happened?

1494
01:24:18,488 --> 01:24:19,626
No, you don't.

1495
01:24:20,657 --> 01:24:22,193
A lot of people think
I am wrong, but...

1496
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:23,600
...does that make me wrong too?

1497
01:24:27,364 --> 01:24:28,900
You're not wrong for me, Bitti.

1498
01:24:29,032 --> 01:24:31,034
So Vidrohi isn't wrong either.

1499
01:24:40,877 --> 01:24:41,912
Fine.

1500
01:24:46,282 --> 01:24:48,694
Tea, son.
Tea won't help anymore, aunty.

1501
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:49,828
Then why did you ask me to make one.

1502
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:51,830
Milk has become so expensive.

1503
01:24:52,956 --> 01:24:56,563
I wonder what Bitti
likes about that oaf.

1504
01:24:56,826 --> 01:24:59,397
This is a one-sided competition,
brother.

1505
01:25:04,334 --> 01:25:05,335
You didn't go to the office today.

1506
01:25:05,368 --> 01:25:07,041
I took an off for Vidrohi.

1507
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:08,181
Come on.

1508
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:10,114
There goes your queen.

1509
01:25:10,607 --> 01:25:11,915
Wow, amazing.

1510
01:25:11,975 --> 01:25:13,886
Come on, let's end this game.

1511
01:25:13,944 --> 01:25:18,222
Just to be on the safer side,
you should say I love you.

1512
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:21,828
You see, sometime even a rat...

1513
01:25:22,686 --> 01:25:25,132
...can create obstacles
in a snake's path.

1514
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:28,961
Sari, but I don't
know how to wear this.

1515
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:30,597
I know how to drape it.

1516
01:25:34,197 --> 01:25:38,043
I never imagined that
sari draper will put one on me.

1517
01:25:39,402 --> 01:25:40,608
Okay, brother.

1518
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,248
Hello.

1519
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:45,582
Vidrohi has opened
sari shop in Bareilly.

1520
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:53,152
Hello.
Hello, Listen...

1521
01:25:53,283 --> 01:25:54,660
You are fare from job.
Don't come now.

1522
01:25:54,718 --> 01:25:58,029
You can't fare me... I fare
you from the post of my boss.

1523
01:25:58,521 --> 01:26:01,195
You can keep the money you
owe me and eat a cake.

1524
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:04,301
I should have told
Bitti the truth...

1525
01:26:06,863 --> 01:26:09,002
...that I am the author
of Bareilly Ki Barfi.

1526
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:11,145
And I wrote those letters.

1527
01:26:11,368 --> 01:26:13,405
Hello son...

1528
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:21,720
You look smarter than
that Vidrohi, brother.

1529
01:26:24,714 --> 01:26:30,494
Actually you look smart anyway,
brother.

1530
01:26:31,321 --> 01:26:33,358
Whether in a group or solo.

1531
01:26:33,489 --> 01:26:37,027
You look handsome from every angle.

1532
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:41,368
You shouldn't make a noise
while eating, it's bad manners.

1533
01:26:42,065 --> 01:26:43,043
Quite.

1534
01:26:43,233 --> 01:26:45,770
The real fun in eating a malai malpuha
(Indian sweet) is when you make a noise.

1535
01:26:48,605 --> 01:26:50,812
Up up chap chap (sounds)

1536
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:53,379
Together now... Chap haa...

1537
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:54,486
Vidrohi.

1538
01:26:55,078 --> 01:26:57,251
Does it matter whether
I am a virgin or not?

1539
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,126
Virgin? What's that?

1540
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:01,985
And, when I don't even
know what it means...

1541
01:27:02,085 --> 01:27:03,223
...how can it bother me?

1542
01:27:04,788 --> 01:27:05,960
Cheers to that.

1543
01:27:07,157 --> 01:27:08,659
Do you like watching films?

1544
01:27:09,059 --> 01:27:10,834
I like watching English films.

1545
01:27:10,994 --> 01:27:12,496
I see...
Yes.

1546
01:27:13,162 --> 01:27:14,766
Do you know English?

1547
01:27:16,466 --> 01:27:17,774
I did once...

1548
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:20,007
...huh, I didn't like it.
So, I sent it back.

1549
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,344
Hold it properly.

1550
01:27:26,876 --> 01:27:30,449
The time to say
I love you is gone.

1551
01:27:32,015 --> 01:27:34,825
We just need to wait
and see who Bitti chooses.

1552
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:37,320
Me...

1553
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:40,826
...or him.

1554
01:27:41,658 --> 01:27:43,467
You had a problem when I was single.

1555
01:27:43,827 --> 01:27:44,862
And now, when I want to get married...

1556
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:45,735
...you still have a problem.

1557
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:47,899
There is no problem, dear.

1558
01:27:48,398 --> 01:27:52,244
I never stopped you before, and
I won't stop you now either.

1559
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:57,215
But think before
you take any decision.

1560
01:27:57,273 --> 01:27:58,616
What's to think?

1561
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:02,322
She's marrying a boy.
That's all that matters to me.

1562
01:28:02,512 --> 01:28:04,253
Yeah, of course, you'll be happy.

1563
01:28:04,414 --> 01:28:05,415
Finally, you're getting
rid of this headache.

1564
01:28:05,548 --> 01:28:06,925
I have every reason to be happy.

1565
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:11,398
When your daughter's
staying with you...

1566
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:13,297
...you keep thinking
when she will leave.

1567
01:28:14,824 --> 01:28:16,770
And, when she's about to leave...

1568
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:20,339
...you can't stop thinking how
you're going to live without her.

1569
01:28:24,567 --> 01:28:26,444
Papa, I won't go if you start crying.

1570
01:28:26,536 --> 01:28:28,243
Don't listen to him.

1571
01:28:28,505 --> 01:28:30,610
He has tears even
if someone pinches him.

1572
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,250
What's wrong?

1573
01:28:33,076 --> 01:28:35,078
Fine, I'll get some
tea for you with sugar.

1574
01:28:35,578 --> 01:28:36,716
Move, son.

1575
01:28:43,887 --> 01:28:44,831
Do you have a cigarette?

1576
01:28:52,429 --> 01:28:54,238
That you want to spend
the rest of your life with him.

1577
01:28:55,865 --> 01:28:57,367
All he did was write a book.

1578
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,276
Well, it did matter before.

1579
01:29:01,171 --> 01:29:04,277
But now, it doesn't matter
whether he wrote that book or not.

1580
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:10,115
All that matters now is that
Vidrohi is not a bad guy.

1581
01:29:11,147 --> 01:29:14,617
He loves me and...
I'll be happy with him.

1582
01:29:16,286 --> 01:29:17,196
Right?

1583
01:29:19,422 --> 01:29:20,867
Judging by the way you are, Bitti...

1584
01:29:21,591 --> 01:29:26,062
...you'll come across many more
people in life, who'll love you.

1585
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:28,470
Will you marry anyone?

1586
01:29:29,265 --> 01:29:31,871
Which people are you talking about?

1587
01:29:32,969 --> 01:29:35,074
Do you know how many
times I've been rejected?

1588
01:29:36,973 --> 01:29:38,816
Who is willing to marry me?

1589
01:29:41,844 --> 01:29:43,790
You've too have known
me for a long time now.

1590
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:46,983
But you didn't fall in love.

1591
01:29:51,521 --> 01:29:53,558
I know I've certain faults, Chirag.

1592
01:29:55,425 --> 01:29:58,804
But if Vidrohi still likes me,
then what's the problem?

1593
01:29:58,995 --> 01:30:01,805
Why would I have a problem?
Then...

1594
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:07,448
My only advice is that
you shouldn't be hasty.

1595
01:30:07,637 --> 01:30:09,583
What hasty?

1596
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:13,781
Look, I've thought this through,
before making a decision.

1597
01:30:16,212 --> 01:30:18,624
And please don't think I
am making a compromise.

1598
01:30:29,459 --> 01:30:30,597
Catch.

1599
01:30:35,598 --> 01:30:37,202
I told you I'll steal Bitti
from right under your nose.

1600
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:39,702
And I did.

1601
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:46,653
Our engagements been fixed.

1602
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:52,357
See you.

1603
01:30:53,349 --> 01:30:55,056
Regards to your mother.

1604
01:30:56,752 --> 01:30:59,062
Stop it...
Let me catch my breath.

1605
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:01,896
I've been holding myself
back for a long lime.

1606
01:31:01,991 --> 01:31:03,527
If I let go,
you'll have nothing to hold on to.

1607
01:31:03,593 --> 01:31:05,595
Bloody Vidrohi...
Move.

1608
01:31:08,297 --> 01:31:10,573
I'm destined to kill a bearded guy.

1609
01:31:12,302 --> 01:31:13,508
So stay away.

1610
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:19,813
You knew... how much I love Bitti.
I loved her a lot.

1611
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:23,315
You used to call her sister-in-law.

1612
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,690
Why did you betray me?

1613
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,354
Why did you do it?

1614
01:31:28,718 --> 01:31:30,220
Did Bitti love you?

1615
01:31:31,087 --> 01:31:32,065
Huh?

1616
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:37,436
I loved Rama but she didn't.

1617
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:38,861
So, what should I do?

1618
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:41,501
Sit in a corner and cry like a woman?

1619
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:44,139
get this through your skull...

1620
01:31:45,301 --> 01:31:47,338
Bitti loves me.

1621
01:31:48,638 --> 01:31:49,708
Okay?

1622
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:54,353
Now, find someone else
for your ailing heart.

1623
01:31:55,378 --> 01:31:58,222
Because, if anyone now tries
to come between Bitti and me...

1624
01:31:59,649 --> 01:32:02,289
...I swear, I will make him pay.

1625
01:32:08,224 --> 01:32:09,999
Do show up for the engagement, brother.

1626
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:14,902
We haven't called
for the musical hand.

1627
01:32:16,599 --> 01:32:17,577
Listen...

1628
01:32:20,069 --> 01:32:23,414
This altitude you're showing off...

1629
01:32:25,341 --> 01:32:27,150
It's my gift to you.

1630
01:32:28,711 --> 01:32:31,351
And, when Bitti learns the truth...

1631
01:32:31,814 --> 01:32:33,316
...she will kick you out.

1632
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:35,128
I see...

1633
01:32:36,519 --> 01:32:38,157
And, who's going to tell Bitti?

1634
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:41,902
Your... best friend, or you?

1635
01:32:42,091 --> 01:32:43,195
Who's going to tell her?

1636
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:48,334
Look... if I'm heart-broken,

1637
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,138
I'll break everyone's heart.

1638
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,647
I won't let it happen again.

1639
01:32:58,441 --> 01:32:59,977
You will never change, brother.

1640
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:03,984
Fine, go tell her.

1641
01:33:11,854 --> 01:33:14,027
Why isn't the light glowing?

1642
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:16,566
The light glowing, uncle.
Then, why can't I see it?

1643
01:33:16,659 --> 01:33:18,696
It dim light uncle.
Will shine clearly in the night.

1644
01:33:18,828 --> 01:33:20,466
I see, it will look better at night.

1645
01:33:20,863 --> 01:33:22,900
Then keep them closer,
show I've spent money.

1646
01:33:22,999 --> 01:33:24,808
The lights should shine bright, OK.

1647
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:28,578
Put it up there, stop bothering me.

1648
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:30,012
Yes, there.

1649
01:33:31,073 --> 01:33:34,145
Aunty, where is Bitti?
She must be in the room upstairs.

1650
01:33:35,344 --> 01:33:37,620
Why is he looking so dull today?

1651
01:34:02,104 --> 01:34:03,310
How am I looking?

1652
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:07,086
Very beautiful.

1653
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:16,862
What's wrong with you?

1654
01:34:17,486 --> 01:34:18,624
What can be wrong with me?

1655
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:20,395
You don't look happy.

1656
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,860
You look really happy.

1657
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:24,799
I am very happy.

1658
01:34:30,065 --> 01:34:31,510
You had something to say?

1659
01:34:34,003 --> 01:34:35,346
Chirag.

1660
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:40,015
Yes, aunty.
Come down, son. I need you here.

1661
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:48,051
Listen, son. Come here.

1662
01:34:48,484 --> 01:34:51,021
Such a pretty ring.

1663
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:52,359
Isn't it nice?
Yes.

1664
01:34:52,488 --> 01:34:55,264
I really like it a lot.

1665
01:34:55,358 --> 01:34:57,031
Give me your hand, son.

1666
01:34:57,093 --> 01:34:59,937
Let's see how it looks on Vidrohi's finger?
Aunty...

1667
01:35:00,029 --> 01:35:02,737
Aunty, why...
Let me see, son.

1668
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:05,440
Oh my, it looks so pretty.

1669
01:35:05,534 --> 01:35:07,707
See, Rama, how does it look?

1670
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,408
It really looks good, aunty.
It does, doesn't it?

1671
01:35:09,472 --> 01:35:11,042
Even I like it a lot.

1672
01:35:11,107 --> 01:35:12,984
Now, this is one good thing that happened.
Have some more.

1673
01:35:13,075 --> 01:35:15,180
Come on, son, keep it back in the box.

1674
01:35:20,316 --> 01:35:21,818
What happened?
It's stuck, aunty.

1675
01:35:21,984 --> 01:35:25,796
How can it he stuck? Turn it around.
What have you done?

1676
01:35:25,888 --> 01:35:28,391
Turn it around.
Pull it out, aunty.

1677
01:35:28,524 --> 01:35:31,835
How did it get stuck?
I'll hold his hand and you pull it out.

1678
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:33,567
I can't get it out.
Try to remove it.

1679
01:35:33,663 --> 01:35:35,802
Someone get butter.
Pull.

1680
01:35:35,898 --> 01:35:38,902
get some soap.
What happened?

1681
01:35:39,068 --> 01:35:41,105
What are you doing?
Pull, aunty.

1682
01:35:41,237 --> 01:35:43,843
The ring is stuck on the finger.
How can it get stuck?

1683
01:35:44,006 --> 01:35:46,111
What's wrong?
Why are you all screaming?

1684
01:35:46,342 --> 01:35:49,880
I only wanted to see how it looked,
but I didn't know...

1685
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,750
She'll get it out... you go.

1686
01:35:52,048 --> 01:35:53,322
Be quiet, she'll do it.

1687
01:36:10,132 --> 01:36:15,582
<i>You're untouched by
the norms of the world.</i>

1688
01:36:15,938 --> 01:36:21,581
<i>You're the grace in my eyes.</i>

1689
01:36:21,744 --> 01:36:25,351
<i>Every breath I take...</i>

1690
01:36:25,448 --> 01:36:28,395
<i>...and in all my dreams...</i>

1691
01:36:28,517 --> 01:36:33,660
<i>I see your prints everywhere I look.</i>

1692
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:39,171
<i>O wanderer... I am in love...</i>

1693
01:36:39,295 --> 01:36:42,435
<i>Love with you.</i>

1694
01:36:45,868 --> 01:36:51,147
<i>O wanderer... I am in love...</i>

1695
01:36:51,273 --> 01:36:54,311
<i>Love with you.</i>

1696
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:11,904
<i>You're like the shadow
of a soaring bird.</i>

1697
01:37:12,027 --> 01:37:17,477
<i>The boat that floats carelessly.</i>

1698
01:37:19,568 --> 01:37:24,244
<i>You cannot settle down...</i>

1699
01:37:24,406 --> 01:37:30,220
<i>...because,
you're like the caravan of a nomad.</i>

1700
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:36,521
<i>I am treading on the footsteps,
you've left behind.</i>

1701
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:42,629
<i>Wondering whether we'll ever meet.</i>

1702
01:37:42,725 --> 01:37:48,141
<i>O wanderer... I am in love...</i>

1703
01:37:48,264 --> 01:37:50,676
<i>Love with you.</i>

1704
01:37:54,804 --> 01:37:59,947
<i>O wanderer... I am in love...</i>

1705
01:38:00,042 --> 01:38:03,114
<i>Love with you.</i>

1706
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:09,161
<i>Love with you.</i>

1707
01:38:09,285 --> 01:38:12,459
<i>Love with you.</i>

1708
01:38:12,588 --> 01:38:15,194
<i>Love with you.</i>

1709
01:38:17,193 --> 01:38:20,606
<i>Love with you.</i>

1710
01:38:35,444 --> 01:38:36,684
What did sister-in-law say?

1711
01:38:39,014 --> 01:38:40,516
I couldn't gather
the courage to tell her.

1712
01:38:40,683 --> 01:38:41,627
Why?

1713
01:38:42,852 --> 01:38:44,889
She's very happy with Vidrohi.

1714
01:38:47,222 --> 01:38:48,997
How could I break her heart?

1715
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:56,307
I was very selfish, Munna.

1716
01:39:00,703 --> 01:39:03,411
I couldn't see anything beyond
my happiness alone.

1717
01:39:05,241 --> 01:39:06,242
Well...

1718
01:39:08,377 --> 01:39:11,290
Love taught me to
be happy in other's happiness.

1719
01:39:17,853 --> 01:39:19,992
And Vidrohi's not a bad guy either.

1720
01:39:23,826 --> 01:39:26,067
You're not a villain, brother.

1721
01:40:01,931 --> 01:40:03,069
How are you, brother?

1722
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:07,146
Fine.

1723
01:40:08,404 --> 01:40:09,610
Sorry, man.

1724
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:14,381
It was entirely my fault.

1725
01:40:18,047 --> 01:40:20,027
I troubled you without a reason.

1726
01:40:29,825 --> 01:40:30,929
It's okay.

1727
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,644
Here.

1728
01:40:39,268 --> 01:40:40,440
What's this?

1729
01:40:41,336 --> 01:40:45,045
I've written something for Bitti.

1730
01:40:45,841 --> 01:40:47,616
It's from you...

1731
01:40:49,878 --> 01:40:52,984
...because you're a really bad writer.

1732
01:40:57,753 --> 01:40:59,357
Read this out at your engagement.

1733
01:41:00,289 --> 01:41:01,632
She will like it.

1734
01:41:04,794 --> 01:41:06,603
Please come to my engagement, brother.

1735
01:41:07,796 --> 01:41:09,275
It will make me really happy.

1736
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:13,303
I don't have any choice now.

1737
01:41:15,805 --> 01:41:19,582
Even today, there's not a
single dull moment in Mishra Sadan.

1738
01:41:19,775 --> 01:41:23,723
Poor Romeo... is making sweets.

1739
01:41:23,846 --> 01:41:25,951
Listen...
Greetings, uncle.

1740
01:41:26,015 --> 01:41:27,756
Congratulation.

1741
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,056
Chirag.

1742
01:41:29,151 --> 01:41:31,927
Pour some milk in that coffee machine.

1743
01:41:32,154 --> 01:41:34,065
Yes, uncle.
Look here...

1744
01:41:34,156 --> 01:41:37,933
Hello, sister. Hello...
Bless you son..

1745
01:41:39,928 --> 01:41:41,271
Upstairs, go on...
Yes.

1746
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:44,470
Look here,
your friend is making sweets.

1747
01:41:44,633 --> 01:41:45,475
Go... go.

1748
01:41:45,901 --> 01:41:46,811
Come, son.

1749
01:41:46,869 --> 01:41:49,349
The function is upstairs.
There's a problem, brother.

1750
01:41:49,538 --> 01:41:50,608
What's wrong with your voice.

1751
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:51,743
That's the problem.

1752
01:41:51,873 --> 01:41:54,046
My mother made tea
from curdled milk...

1753
01:41:54,243 --> 01:41:56,849
And this is what happened.
What now?

1754
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:04,024
Now, who's going to read this letter?
Who?

1755
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,999
Munna, you read it.
No...

1756
01:42:06,622 --> 01:42:08,295
You read it then.
How can I read it?

1757
01:42:08,357 --> 01:42:09,563
What are you saying?

1758
01:42:09,658 --> 01:42:12,400
Hello... Thank you for coming.

1759
01:42:12,695 --> 01:42:14,265
Be happy son.

1760
01:42:14,296 --> 01:42:16,003
You read it.
Let's go upstairs.

1761
01:42:16,098 --> 01:42:17,133
Please read it.

1762
01:42:17,466 --> 01:42:20,140
Please read it. Brother.
Fill it with clarified butter.

1763
01:42:20,235 --> 01:42:21,680
Bitti...

1764
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:26,479
Look now, your electricity
department is betraying us.

1765
01:42:29,878 --> 01:42:31,755
Lallan, coffee.

1766
01:42:31,881 --> 01:42:33,861
Coffee...
Here she is.

1767
01:42:34,016 --> 01:42:37,361
Papa.
Wow... so beautiful.

1768
01:42:39,488 --> 01:42:43,766
That way, dear. That way.
You're looking so beautiful, my child.

1769
01:42:43,859 --> 01:42:45,532
That way?
Let's go.

1770
01:42:47,263 --> 01:42:48,799
Sit here.

1771
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,803
Sit here.
Yes.

1772
01:42:53,702 --> 01:42:55,340
So beautiful.
The curly hair looks so nice.

1773
01:42:55,371 --> 01:42:58,352
Don't touch it.
Don't touch her hair, you'll ruin it.

1774
01:42:58,473 --> 01:43:00,282
Excuse me...
my dear brothers...

1775
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:05,349
...and sisters, except for one.
What's wrong with his voice?

1776
01:43:05,481 --> 01:43:06,983
Don't know.
Mothers and Fathers...

1777
01:43:07,082 --> 01:43:08,993
On the auspicious
occasion of my engagement...

1778
01:43:09,485 --> 01:43:12,989
...I've written something for you,
Bitti, straight from my heart.

1779
01:43:13,789 --> 01:43:15,496
But if I read it out in this voice...

1780
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:17,298
...then, you'll all get depressed.

1781
01:43:17,993 --> 01:43:24,410
So, my best friend Chirag
will read it out for me.

1782
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,938
Come on, Chirag.

1783
01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:27,679
I'll go sit there.
Yeah...

1784
01:43:27,803 --> 01:43:30,283
It's hard to hear anything from here.
He's written a letter... for you.

1785
01:43:30,339 --> 01:43:32,341
Come sister-in-law.
Sit here...

1786
01:43:33,175 --> 01:43:34,210
Move aside.

1787
01:43:43,519 --> 01:43:45,089
Bareilly Ki Barfi... Bitti!

1788
01:43:47,923 --> 01:43:49,095
You must be wondering...

1789
01:43:49,324 --> 01:43:51,235
I've already written
so much about you...

1790
01:43:51,327 --> 01:43:53,204
...that what do I have left to say.

1791
01:43:56,097 --> 01:43:57,007
You wouldn't have
the slightest clue...

1792
01:43:57,099 --> 01:44:00,979
...but I've enough to say about you
which can last an entire lifetime.

1793
01:44:04,473 --> 01:44:06,180
Some think you're short-tempered.

1794
01:44:07,076 --> 01:44:08,453
Some think you're spoilt.

1795
01:44:09,344 --> 01:44:10,789
Your mother amusingly says that...

1796
01:44:10,846 --> 01:44:13,087
...when you wander out at nights,
you look like a witch.

1797
01:44:14,316 --> 01:44:16,227
Some times you're odd...

1798
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:18,892
...and some times
you're very interesting.

1799
01:44:23,359 --> 01:44:26,306
But I swear,
I like everything about you.

1800
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:30,243
Oh, God. What just happened?

1801
01:44:33,435 --> 01:44:35,472
Oh no, not another power-cut.

1802
01:44:35,604 --> 01:44:37,914
He was reading
such a romantic letter.

1803
01:44:38,006 --> 01:44:39,610
See...

1804
01:44:39,775 --> 01:44:40,981
There's a power cut
in the entire city...

1805
01:44:41,076 --> 01:44:42,077
...but power will be
restored soon enough.

1806
01:44:42,144 --> 01:44:43,646
We regret the inconvenience caused.

1807
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:49,693
You're very strange.

1808
01:44:53,021 --> 01:44:55,023
Every time you laugh,
your front tooth's visible.

1809
01:44:57,059 --> 01:44:59,061
Even your gums light up.

1810
01:45:01,029 --> 01:45:02,565
Every time you cry,
your nose starts running.

1811
01:45:04,566 --> 01:45:05,544
You get happy without a reason...

1812
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:07,410
...and lose your temper
over trivial things.

1813
01:45:10,773 --> 01:45:12,650
It's not easy to love you.

1814
01:45:15,076 --> 01:45:18,285
But, it's harder to not love you.

1815
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:31,994
You're like this light in my life.

1816
01:45:36,732 --> 01:45:42,478
And no one in this world,
can love you as much as I do.

1817
01:45:46,208 --> 01:45:47,585
Let's make a bet.

1818
01:45:50,746 --> 01:45:53,056
And, if I lose... you
can take anything you want.

1819
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:58,664
Will you marry me?

1820
01:46:20,409 --> 01:46:21,547
Yes.

1821
01:46:23,178 --> 01:46:24,714
Come, Vidrohi.

1822
01:46:31,787 --> 01:46:33,630
How long are you going to hide it?

1823
01:46:38,227 --> 01:46:41,106
I know who wrote Bareilly Ki Barfi.

1824
01:46:42,998 --> 01:46:44,500
Along with all those letters.

1825
01:46:46,501 --> 01:46:47,844
I know everything.

1826
01:46:49,604 --> 01:46:51,106
But, who told you?

1827
01:46:55,310 --> 01:46:56,311
Munna?

1828
01:46:56,445 --> 01:46:57,617
I am not a traitor, brother.

1829
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,454
I am on your side.
I don't know.

1830
01:47:01,116 --> 01:47:03,687
Yes, son,
I just found out a few days ago.

1831
01:47:03,952 --> 01:47:06,660
And we started preparing since then.

1832
01:47:07,856 --> 01:47:08,994
Then...

1833
01:47:11,126 --> 01:47:12,366
Vidrohi.

1834
01:47:13,362 --> 01:47:15,069
Vidrohi got emotional.

1835
01:47:16,164 --> 01:47:18,542
When I tried to console him...

1836
01:47:19,635 --> 01:47:20,978
...he spilled out everything.

1837
01:47:21,303 --> 01:47:23,283
Chirag is the author
of Bareilly Ki Barfi.

1838
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:24,975
These two got me in this mess.

1839
01:47:28,043 --> 01:47:30,580
You could've told
me if you already knew.

1840
01:47:30,779 --> 01:47:32,588
But I didn't know...

1841
01:47:33,148 --> 01:47:38,826
...whether you really love me,
or maybe because...

1842
01:47:38,887 --> 01:47:40,662
...you see Babli in me.

1843
01:47:42,023 --> 01:47:44,697
And it was very important
for me to find out.

1844
01:47:47,195 --> 01:47:49,004
Hence I played this charade.

1845
01:47:54,402 --> 01:47:56,575
Through Mr. Bishnoi we booked...

1846
01:47:56,905 --> 01:47:58,907
Oh no...

1847
01:48:01,776 --> 01:48:03,278
Cheers to that.

1848
01:48:04,446 --> 01:48:05,584
You didn't fall in love with me.

1849
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,853
I tested you at every step.

1850
01:48:08,049 --> 01:48:10,120
But you passed every test.

1851
01:48:11,353 --> 01:48:13,299
I troubled you a lot, didn't I?

1852
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:17,295
Sorry.
Don't say sorry.

1853
01:48:19,261 --> 01:48:21,366
Bitti, here you go.

1854
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:22,740
Adorn it.

1855
01:48:23,565 --> 01:48:27,411
But, I don't have one.
I didn't come prepared.

1856
01:48:27,536 --> 01:48:28,981
What will he adorn?
Brother Chirag.

1857
01:48:29,271 --> 01:48:30,409
Look at him.

1858
01:48:42,317 --> 01:48:47,357
Like I said...
Bitti's my sister-in-law.

1859
01:48:47,422 --> 01:48:49,129
I will slap you..

1860
01:48:52,527 --> 01:48:55,701
I troubled you a lot.
It's alright.

1861
01:49:09,444 --> 01:49:10,445
Adorn it.

1862
01:49:13,114 --> 01:49:15,560
I'm going to frame this.

1863
01:49:15,784 --> 01:49:17,263
I'll never forget this ever.

1864
01:49:21,289 --> 01:49:22,290
Papa.

1865
01:49:39,908 --> 01:49:41,251
But this didn't fit.

1866
01:49:41,276 --> 01:49:43,779
We took your measurement
yesterday, son.

1867
01:49:43,912 --> 01:49:46,654
You guys really made
me dance to your tunes.

1868
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,628
Coffee's here...

1869
01:49:55,924 --> 01:49:58,837
There's never a power
cut when you need one.

1870
01:50:11,273 --> 01:50:13,514
A story with a name
like 'Barfi' (sweet)...'

1871
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:16,378
'...will always have a happy ending.

1872
01:50:17,813 --> 01:50:18,814
How is it?

1873
01:50:20,515 --> 01:50:21,357
Spicy.

1874
01:50:23,685 --> 01:50:26,723
They are now made for each other.

1875
01:50:35,497 --> 01:50:38,103
'Oh... we completely forgot
to offer you sweets.

1876
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:42,711
Now Vidrohi explains English
films to Rama in his own style.

1877
01:50:43,371 --> 01:50:45,977
But unfortunately, in theatres,
the corner seat is a rarity...

1878
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:48,248
'...when their mother's
sticking around.

1879
01:50:48,376 --> 01:50:50,549
Chirag, Munna, and Vidrohi...

1880
01:50:50,746 --> 01:50:53,556
'...have become more
than just best friends.

1881
01:50:54,349 --> 01:50:55,794
Well, there's just Mr.
Mishra left now.

1882
01:50:56,218 --> 01:50:58,220
During the day,
he listens to his wife...

1883
01:50:58,286 --> 01:51:00,288
'...and at night,
he talks to the fan.

1884
01:51:00,655 --> 01:51:02,157
If you visit Bareilly again...

1885
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:05,238
'...then, instead of wasting
time looking for the earrings...

1886
01:51:05,493 --> 01:51:07,632
'...opt for 'Barfi'
(sweets) instead.

1887
01:51:07,729 --> 01:51:11,108
<i>Your earrings make
my heart skip a beat.</i>

1888
01:51:11,233 --> 01:51:14,737
<i>When you shake the waist,
it steals millions of hearts.</i>

1889
01:51:14,803 --> 01:51:16,612
<i>Stop taunting me...</i>

1890
01:51:16,671 --> 01:51:18,480
<i>Don't be a wise guy.</i>

1891
01:51:18,573 --> 01:51:20,348
<i>I am not Juliet,</i>

1892
01:51:20,442 --> 01:51:22,683
<i>And you're not my Romeo.</i>

1893
01:51:24,312 --> 01:51:27,350
<i>O Sweety...</i>

1894
01:51:27,649 --> 01:51:31,392
<i>O Sweety your drama,
creates a stir.</i>

1895
01:51:31,486 --> 01:51:35,161
<i>This is unfair.</i>

1896
01:51:35,223 --> 01:51:38,761
<i>Believe it or not,
we're crazy about you...</i>

1897
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:42,330
<i>Listen o sweetheart,
we're your beloved.</i>

1898
01:51:42,397 --> 01:51:43,307
<i>...DJ..</i>

1899
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,408
<i>Crazy.</i>

1900
01:51:57,345 --> 01:51:59,154
<i>Don't make a commotion...</i>

1901
01:51:59,214 --> 01:52:00,887
<i>...everyone's watching.</i>

1902
01:52:01,016 --> 01:52:04,520
<i>What do you get
from making a scene.</i>

1903
01:52:04,652 --> 01:52:08,293
<i>Don't ignore me...
I am not useless.</i>

1904
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:11,997
<i>Teach me the language of love.</i>

1905
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:13,869
<i>Stop taunting me...</i>

1906
01:52:13,929 --> 01:52:15,738
<i>Don't be a wise guy.</i>

we're your beloved.</i>

<i>Always dressed smartly,
whether it's Delhi or Agra.</i>
