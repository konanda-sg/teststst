1
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,441
How is it?
- Nice.

2
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,314
It's not just nice...it's spectacular.

3
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,114
Because my Shastn/ ji designed it.

4
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,422
And do you know what I did?

5
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,424
I killed him.

6
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,564
Yes, I killed him.

7
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,129
L.. I killed him.

8
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:46,584
Birth-Death, Everything is destined.

9
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:55,182
From Sita's abduction
to Lanka's destruction.

10
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,828
From Draupadi's ignominy
to the defeat of Kauravs.

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,331
Everything was destined .

12
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,268
The one above us all has
pre-destined everything for us.

13
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:14,143
We will have our share of rains.

14
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,111
And only our share of sunshine.

15
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,728
The flipping of the coin
will favour us when it's our time.

16
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,526
Heads!

17
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,134
Everything is destined .

18
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,559
But the interesting thing is that...

19
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:46,066
We have no idea where our
share of clouds, sun and coin are?

20
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,718
That's why I say

21
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,019
Keep changing the
direction of the wind.

22
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,766
Keep Collecting sunshine in your fist.

23
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,260
Keep tossing the coin.

24
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,064
Without fail, relentlessly.

25
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,736
Because we are all destined to fly.

Shivkar Talpade!

39
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,796
You're playing right
in the middle of my class.

40
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,541
You're also teaching right
in the middle of my game.

41
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,409
See, children..

42
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,413
At the end of my cane..

43
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:08,143
...stands the most stupid
person in the world. - That's true.

44
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,345
But which end?

45
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,084
This end or that end?
- Quiet!

46
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,387
Quiet! Learn something
from your nephew, Narayan

47
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,259
Year after year he has
done well at his studies...

48
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,663
...so much so that today
he shares the same bench as you.

49
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,467
And you, your books have been rusting
in the same trunk for years.

50
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,594
Same trunk?

51
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,659
No, sir. I changed my
trunks this morning only.

52
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,000
Quiet.

53
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,271
Do you want to set
a record in failing?

54
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,442
Do you want to study?

55
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,281
Get out.
- Forever?

56
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,215
Get out!
- My bag...

57
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,750
Get out of here.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,421
Quiet! No one's going anywhere.

59
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,222
I'll teach that scoundrel a lesson.

60
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,998
"Free Flying Head"

61
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,677
"Free Flying Head"

62
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:17,347
"Pay your respects and look above"

63
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,552
"I'm out to hunt with my gun of love."

64
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:26,359
"Pay your respects and look above"

65
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,092
"I'm out to hunt with my gun of love."

66
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:36,106
“My heart's the prince
of my imaginary world“

67
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,199
"Salute now...here comes...

68
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,144
"Free Flying Head"

69
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,077
"Free Flying Head"

70
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,509
What? Signature?

71
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,568
Not just signature...
it's a memorabilia.

72
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,637
It's always treasured.
- Of glorious people.

73
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,047
I see.
So it's decided.

74
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,449
One day I'll do
something so glorious..

75
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,214
...that you will take
my autograph as well.

76
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,687
And call it.. memorabilia.

77
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,087
Buzz off!

78
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,419
Laughing at me?

79
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,091
Should I prove it to you?

80
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,192
How about a bet?
- Done.

81
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,693
“The sultry night like
a woman is studded with stars...“

82
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,295
"She stands wrapped
in a shawl with moon..."

83
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,499
"...stitched onto
it which has no scars..."

84
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:48,308
“The sultry night like
a woman is studded with a stars...“

85
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,438
"She stands wrapped
in a shawl with moon..."

86
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,642
"...stitched onto
it which has no scars..."

87
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:57,279
“To reveal the mystery,
I scrapped off the moon.“

88
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:02,315
"There's a hole in the universe
as big as the one in my pocket"

89
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,554
"Not a penny to spare..."

90
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,961
"But a smile on my
face I always share"

91
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,627
"Will sell quaner of
my head for millions..,"

92
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,967
“Salute everyone. . .here comes. . .“

93
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,337
"Free flying head"

94
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:27,045
"Free flying head"

95
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,024
"Free flying head"

96
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,470
Ticket.
- Are you crazy?

97
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,237
Here.

98
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,437
Stopping me from
entering my own house.

99
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,174
Who appointed you? Tell me.
Who?

100
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,182
Your father did.

101
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,083
Govind Shambhu Talpade.

102
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,644
He also had to be born
as my father in my house only.

103
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,121
What has the world come to?

104
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,389
I've to climb the pipe to my own home.

105
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,990
Pam's torn!

106
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,013
Come on..

107
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,016
Start..
- Open up. Lift the curtain.

108
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,258
What the..

109
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,210
Hey Champ!... Come quickly.

110
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,005
Your entry's next.

111
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,716
Me?
- Yes. Come quickly.

112
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,448
You're late.

113
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,612
You aren't even ready.

114
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,351
I told you a thousand
times...you will get me fired.

115
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,560
No touching here, uncle..
- Adjust your dhoti.

116
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,563
What's my name in this play?

117
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,496
Dushyant.
Shankuntala's Dushyant.

118
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,033
Go on now.
Go.

119
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,664
Shakuntala...l am your Dushyant,
and you're my Shakun...

120
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,605
Tie it.

121
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,214
You've been drinking again.

122
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,515
Bloody drunkard.

123
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,553
Do you even remember your lines?

124
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,146
I am in love with you, Shakuntala.

125
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,122
Let's go far away.

126
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,191
Hold me tight.

127
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,423
Don't be so shy.

128
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,130
Sorn], I am late.
- Who?

129
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,574
Uncle, it's me.
- Bandya, you?

130
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,169
Yes.
- Then who's that?

131
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,312
Beloved..

132
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,190
Beloved's got red underwear.

133
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,757
You want it?

134
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,629
Who are you?

135
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,464
Who sent him here?

136
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,198
Myself Dushyant... 4th Standard,
Failed eight times.

137
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,602
This is so ironic, friends.

138
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,763
In the stow,
Dushyant didn't recognize Shakuntala.

139
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,306
...and now,
Shakuntala doesn't recognize Dushyant.

140
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,175
That's Talpade's useless boy.

141
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,340
Hey... you mean Govind Shambhu Talpade.

142
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,474
Be respecting.

143
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,108
Someone throw him out of here.

144
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,448
Maushi.

145
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,658
I am in love with you Shakuntala.

146
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,354
Let's go far away.
- What's this drama?

147
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,196
Get him out.
- Get him out.

148
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,529
Out. Out.
- Who was that?

149
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,159
Who was that?
- Me.

150
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:42,229
Rascal...you came here to
watch a drama, didn't you?

151
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,329
So watch.

152
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,339
We want a refund.

153
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,238
We want a refund.

154
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,608
Guard, throw him out.

155
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,342
Maushi, my priceless
head's at stake here.

156
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,382
And he wants a refund.

157
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,077
Get him out.

158
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,485
Get him out.

159
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,545
Let me go.

160
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,114
Shakuntala you explain them.

161
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,490
Let me go.

162
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,627
MY Slippers.

163
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,438
Stop. Stop.

164
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,784
Someone catch him.

165
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,023
Stop.

166
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,086
Stop him.

167
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,515
Matches.
- Matches?

168
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,986
What do you intend to do?

169
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,283
Blow up his lordship's bungalow?

170
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,415
When the time comes, you'll
know what my intentions are?. - What?

171
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,514
No...No...

172
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,562
Well... what will be messier?

173
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:16,327
...your Lordship or his shit?

174
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,664
You're acting smart
I will search you.

175
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,705
You don't know what a fierce
policeman (Foolishman) I am.

176
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,037
It tickles.
- Quiet. Stand straight.

177
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,407
I assure you, Mr. Shastnj.

178
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,470
In my custody you'll
be laughing much less.

179
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,746
Wow, sir...you're looking
like Sherlock Holmes.

180
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,353
Chatterjee, Chatter less...and
arrest him. - Yes, sir.

181
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,264
6-0!

182
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,167
6-0!

183
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,068
6-0!

184
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,128
6-0!

185
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,141
Keep running...Talpade!

186
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:58,800
6-0!

187
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,737
6-0!

188
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,641
Get up.
- Govind Shambhu Talpade..

189
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,446
...Is that the way to
wake people up? - What?

190
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,679
Did you hear that, Kaushaliya?

191
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,212
Now your ill-mannered
son will teach us manners?

192
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,226
What's this?
- I don't know.

193
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,555
You don't know..
How could you know?

194
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,359
Education and you are like
the opposite banks of a river.

195
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,694
Give that back.

196
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,530
It wrong to touch other's belongings.

197
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,035
When will you learn, Govind Shambhu?

198
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,765
And who are you? An idol of learning?

199
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,372
At first it was just
a little fondness for alcohol.

200
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,001
But now you're going
to dance girls as well.

201
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,443
Right?

202
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,641
This is the first time
anyone from the Talpade family..

203
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,741
...was found at a dance girl's place.

204
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:45,182
You only said...do something
that no one has done before.

205
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,484
And now that I did..

206
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,218
...It's hard for you to pat my back.

207
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,281
Shivy.

208
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,595
Please...just concentrate
on your studies.

209
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,653
You've flunked 8 times.

210
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,290
I can't see it again.

211
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,096
Well...don't get your cataract treated.

212
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,535
And you won't ever see anything again.

213
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,596
Shivy. Quiet. Aren't you ashamed?

214
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,437
What shame, mother?

215
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,171
If he had any shame, he would know..

216
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,645
...that boys half his age
are struggling for independence.

217
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,705
And he's blabbering nonsense.

218
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,213
Brother,
only slaves fight for liberty.

219
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,177
I am free. From here.

220
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,019
And anyway...we don't just
want freedom from the Brithishers.

221
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,151
Grandma needs freedom
from our traditions.

222
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,058
...which made her shave off her hair.

223
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,094
Mother needs freedom from your fun].

224
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,722
Poor woman can't speak.
- See!

225
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,162
Sister-in-law needs
freedom from our society.

226
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,226
Which did not let her study.

227
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,773
And brother...you want freedom too...

228
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,303
From me!

229
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,345
And Govind, you need freedom too..

230
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,777
From your orthodoxy.

231
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,174
Because that's the root of all evil.

232
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,478
And after that, we'll no longer beg..

233
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,019
...we would rather snatch
our freedom from the British.

234
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,481
Hey"-

235
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,551
Brigadier Shivy Talpade...
of the buffoon battalion.

236
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,595
Wasn't your horn honking enough..

237
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,459
...that now you have
also started shouting.

238
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,363
Not a horn. It's a trumpet.

239
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,467
But, where is it?

240
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,494
Back again to be beaten.

241
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,163
No...No..l just wanted to see whether..

242
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,995
...you still look
beautiful when I am sober.

243
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,461
Come back in the evening.

244
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,029
Stars don't shine in the day.

245
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:49,236
It's lying on the
table...your English horn.

246
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,108
Champa picked it up from the stage.

247
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,616
And my head?

248
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,652
It's been missing since last night.

249
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,119
I guess that also got left behind.

250
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,351
Did you find it?

251
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,456
You didn't tell me
what you saw. - What?

252
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:08,055
Do I still look beautiful
after you're sober...or not?

253
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,662
What are you saying?

254
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,433
Liquor is not as
intoxicating as you are.

255
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,003
You look gorgeous.

256
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,301
Those with an empty pocket.

257
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,569
...try charming with their words.

258
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,740
Anyway, I am used to people like you.

259
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,005
Who often speak nonsense
when they're drunk.

260
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:31,012
Don't forget, some people often
speak the truth when they are drunk.

261
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,651
This is Shastn/'s bag. Check it!

262
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,111
There's no book in here, sir.

263
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,712
Some say he's a scientist.

264
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,582
Some say he's a freedom fighter.

265
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,250
I say he's a bomb-maker.

266
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,591
He's a clown,
and you're too worried about him.

267
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,188
E mptY-bag . . .empty stomach . .

268
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,601
Empty mind.
- Empty-bag... Empty mind.

269
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,003
They revolted against
the queen, in '57.

270
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,210
Keep an eye on him.
- Sir.

271
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,402
Hey...who's there?

272
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,736
Get down.
- Catch him! Catch him!

273
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,137
Get down.
- Wait. Catch him.

274
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,415
Don't push.

275
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:12,588
Oh...
- Oh...what are you doing here?

276
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,181
When did you come back
from Benaras.. - Hey.

277
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,453
First tell me, where's my book?

278
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,689
First you tell me,
how did that book get into my shin?

279
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,425
If they overhear,
we'll be skinned alive.

280
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,399
Excellent progress.

281
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,630
First brothel and now jail.

282
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,331
He's getting crazier by the day.

283
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,466
Getting crazy is the
sign of getting smart

284
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,169
According to Charu Saraswati ji..

285
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,238
Look, please don't support him,
Shastry ji.

286
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,341
And next time you find
him lying on the streets..

287
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,113
...I suggest that you take him home.

288
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,712
It's best if all the
lunatics stay together.

289
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,051
But the bail papers are ready, sir.

290
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,150
I came here to bail someone,
and so I will.

291
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,196
Not for that oaf, but Shastn/ instead.

292
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,120
Shastn]?

293
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,292
May I remind you,
sir, that he's a suspect?

294
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,801
He's harmless.

295
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,503
He's a bit eccentric, but harmless.

296
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,665
Make sure it's done.
- Yes.

297
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,233
Bail!

298
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,569
Bail!

299
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,272
Bail! Bail! Bail!

300
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,541
Bail!

301
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,552
Thank you.
- Welcome.

302
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,149
You really are stupid.

303
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:23,321
Sometimes you have
to scratch someone's back..

304
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:28,658
And then...this one's your own...
Father.

305
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,227
Understood idiot?

306
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,297
Body of iron...brass arms.

307
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,501
Wheels on the legs...and a pointed
nose slicing through the air.

308
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,475
I read it somewhere.

309
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,048
Where's my book?

310
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,612
I know I am an idiot.

311
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,780
But in the current situation,
you have to scratch my back.

312
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,217
Give my bail and take your book.

313
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,061
Sir..

314
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,300
What's he making?

315
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,103
Bomb or something?

316
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,138
Shastn/ ji hardly
ever makes his hair..

317
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,644
What can he possibly make?

318
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,271
Thank you.

319
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,443
I think he knows something, this one.

320
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,546
He's playing a game with us.

321
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,192
Hey"-

322
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,438
I didn't bail you
out for free. - Yeah.

323
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,702
I'll deliver your
book at your address.

324
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,368
My address.

325
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,045
The entire British battalion
doesn't know my address.

326
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,480
He thinks he can find it.

327
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,744
Can't handle a thing.
Neither his book nor his kite.

328
00:22:54,806 --> 00:23:00,154
Pull...Pull..
- No, friend. I got to let it loose.

329
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,625
The Wind's blowing from the west,
the sea.

330
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:08,563
If I tie it here,
it'll keep floating for several hours.

331
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,167
It's not saline.

332
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,498
So the wind isn't
blowing from the sea..

333
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,196
...and it won't keep up for hours.

334
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,198
2-3 minutes more.

335
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,673
5 at the most.

336
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,641
If you want to take a nap..

337
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,737
...then fix two paper wings
on either side of the kite.

338
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,642
They will cut through the wind,
and the kite will keep floating.

339
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,777
Who told you?
- The eagle's wings.

340
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,248
I noticed them while flying kites.

341
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,318
It's the only bird
that can stay in air..

342
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,381
...for a long time without
flapping it's wings.

343
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,092
Got it?

344
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,373
Shivy.

345
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,505
Any relation with
that girl means suicide.

346
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,174
Think before you do anything.

347
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:05,213
Sister-in-law,
love cannot be rationalized.

348
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,388
So you broke out of prison.

349
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,392
Someone bailed me out.

350
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,553
This mean someone does love you.

351
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,553
Go on . . .marry her.

352
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,188
What's the problem?

353
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,596
It's social service.

354
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,564
Education to women,
widow-marriage and..

355
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,364
Prostitute-marriage!

356
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,608
I wish your heart was
as big as your vocabulary.

357
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,407
Till yesterday you
barely grew a moustache.

358
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,209
...and now you have full grown horns!

359
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,476
Look...if you want
to stay in this house..

360
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,643
...then, you'll live by my rules.

361
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,653
Change yourself...
or change your house.

362
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,482
Okay.

363
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,290
Let him go!

364
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,089
Last night...he was lying
on the streets, unconscious.

365
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:53,102
People thought he was a beggar
and threw these coins at him.

366
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,168
That dance girl has taught
him new means of earning.

367
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,638
Well...whatever it is..

368
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,616
At least it's my hard earned money.

369
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,413
And not taxes extracted
from poor farmers..

370
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,115
...the way you do!

371
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,024
Get out!

372
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,253
Get out!

373
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,998
Shivy!

374
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,184
My dear friend, just watch her dance..

375
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,113
But don't dance to her tunes.

376
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,655
And you just give me money,
not a lecture.

377
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,022
Tailors don't stick pockets
into shins of paupers like us.

378
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,721
And my father used to say..

379
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,124
When one can't change
the direction of the winds...

380
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,393
I know... one should adjust his sails...

381
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:03,337
No, Simply board another boat.

382
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:08,369
And here you have
a ship waiting for you.

383
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,379
Epitome of loyalty!
Have you got my book?

384
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,653
Who gave you the address?

385
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,620
Normally dust deposits on books..

386
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,487
...but, there was sand on this one.

387
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,492
And I saw the cover it was wrapped in.

388
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,687
Duek, a special mix
of cotton and canvas...

389
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,391
...which is used in ships and boats.

390
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,327
I scratched my brains
for few moments.

391
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,096
And made my way here.

392
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,230
By the way, what are you trying to do?

393
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,173
This is beyond your imagination.

394
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,308
Engine. - What?

395
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,539
En...What?

396
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:54,573
A unique device...
that can pull anything.

397
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,175
By itself.

398
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,620
By itself... but upside down?

399
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,716
Opposite of 'Dev' (God).
- Demon!

400
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,054
Dirty mind.

401
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,951
Dev-Ved.

402
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:07,655
Ved-Dev.

403
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,494
'Ved' means the knowledge of the Gods.

404
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,363
Read it backwards.

405
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,401
Shloka 312, verse 8..

406
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,203
'Yuj u r Ved .'

407
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,438
Meaning?
- Meaning..

408
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,543
To do something different.

409
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,173
...you have to turn things around.

410
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,615
Understood?

411
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,744
Govind Shambhu Talpade
always talks nonsense.

412
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,545
But there's one thing
he is right about.

413
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,351
He says, after spending a decade..

414
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:38,155
...with mad ascetics in Beneras,
Shastn/'s lost his marbles.

415
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,997
You've become too cud.

416
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,399
I'll pull your tongue out.

417
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:52,306
Leave the reward for returning
the book, at least lend me some money.

418
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:57,437
Did you see a board outside..
Shastn/ Co-operative Bank?

419
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,572
Leave!

420
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,983
What's behind that cuﬂain?

421
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,489
Why do you care?
Get lost.

422
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,428
Shivy!

423
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,299
Shivy! Shivy! Shivy, wait.

424
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,634
Turn the handle of that
machine on the count of three.

425
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,332
Okay?

426
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,265
Yes!

427
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,351
Charu Saraswati ji..

428
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,389
...what else do I turn upside
down to make this engine work?

429
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:19,656
Mr. Shastnj,
can your machine pull anything?

430
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,323
Yes, it can.
- Sure?

431
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,661
Yes.

432
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:28,170
Then I suggest
you finish making it quickly.

433
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,097
So it can pull the
vehicle of my love..

434
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,168
...back on track.

435
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,040
It's working... chug, chug...chug!

436
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,685
Shivy! Shivy!

437
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,817
Will you work for me?

438
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,252
I will pay you Rs 20 for a month.
Take this.

439
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,126
A man in love is good for nothing.

440
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,533
This is all I need.

441
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,132
And in return...

442
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,671
...you can keep this.

443
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,606
It's brass, German-made.

444
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,642
Keep it safe.

445
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:12,205
But this engine... How?

446
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,376
You didn't need to
turn things upside down.

447
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,216
All you had to do was to
turn the steam back into the engine.

448
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,424
Shloka 318 not 312..

449
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,359
Verse 3 not 8. Yajur Ved.

450
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,187
See you.

451
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,495
Keep moving. Keep moving.

452
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,433
Keep moving, the show's houseful.

453
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,027
Leave. Go.

454
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,128
Champa!

455
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,099
You said the house was full.

456
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,369
What's this?

457
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:42,769
Why?

458
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,612
Can't one man buy all the tickets?

459
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,755
Madam...will you go out with me?

460
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,526
Sitara sells her dance,
not her evenings.

461
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,590
No one can put a price
to anything which is hers.

462
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,431
Neither her evenings..

463
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,598
...nor her an.

464
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,731
You...Who..

465
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,008
So...where will you take me?

466
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,052
It's light. That means it can fly.

467
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,569
Melt it.
- This?

468
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,196
Yes, melt it down.

469
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,740
Shastn/ ji, what are you doing?
Give it back.

470
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,799
You sold it to me.

471
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,739
But it's meant for playing.

472
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,510
Maybe for you,
but it's just brass for me.

473
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,316
Hey..

474
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:06,319
Praise the Lord!

475
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,025
Hail the Lord!

476
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,661
Hail the Lord!

477
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,105
So tell me disciples...

478
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,466
What did Lord Hanuman fly with?

479
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,440
My trumpet

480
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,273
His trumpet.

481
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,108
His trumpet?
- Yes.

482
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,382
But, Shastn/ ji,
wasn't that his trumpet? - It was.

483
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,419
But he sold it to me.
And I paid him for it.

484
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,011
Later he stole it and ran away.

485
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,521
What's going to happen to this boy?

486
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,525
But, Shastn/ ji...he hasn't
come home for a long time.

487
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,187
I'll see whether he did or not.

488
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,026
This is Shivi's room.

489
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:45,226
Shastn/ ji, mind your back.

490
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:51,571
Maybe I don't look that way,
but I am still agile.

491
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,741
And Young -

492
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,690
Shastn/ ji.

493
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,163
Did you get hurt?

494
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,135
He may not look that way,
but he's agile.

495
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,637
And young.
- Be quiet.

496
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,476
But the trumpet?
- The trumpet was made of brass.

497
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:32,209
But your son is a gem.
And I want him.

498
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,244
Good you chucked him out.

499
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,479
Because one doesn't
learn to fly in the nest.

500
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,217
He'll fly.

501
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,621
He'll fly.

502
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,359
He'll fly.

503
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,591
He'll fly.

504
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,264
Shivy will fly.

505
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,796
Will Shivy grow wings?

506
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,031
Oh God...l wonder where he is.

507
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,212
Champ...bring a cup of tea.

508
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:08,073
One? Sitara never shares her tea.

509
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,211
I don't feel like.
- You don't.

510
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,656
No mood or no money?

511
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,623
Get two..
- I can't let my darling pay.

512
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,184
Only one.

513
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:20,724
Me...

514
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,394
Your darling?

515
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,127
Men like you come by the dozens.

516
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,199
Well...what can you do?

517
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,504
Whatever you say?
- Whatever I say?

518
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,269
Yes.

519
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,008
And what if you don't.

520
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,513
Then I won't show
my face to you again.

521
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,181
And what if I do it?

522
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,452
Then...anything you want.

523
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,683
I am quite a rascal...

524
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,156
I can ask for anything.
- I see.

525
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,386
What will you ask for?

526
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,627
A kiss?

527
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,506
Accepted.

528
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,108
On your lips?

529
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,611
Hmmm

530
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,743
Really?

531
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,613
Don't get so excited.

532
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,981
The reward's quite big..

533
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,219
...so you will have
to do something big for it.

534
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,291
You mean...there's a condition.

535
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,221
Conditions!

536
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,493
Three of them.

537
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,160
First one?

538
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,663
Spell it.

539
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:40,203
Make these two glasses full.

540
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,737
Second condition.

541
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,982
"For you the moons
and stars I'll pluck."

542
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,681
"And even break a British officer's
tooth, if you order my lady luck."

543
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,246
Go get me a British officer's tooth!

544
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,327
So officer, you've a tooth ache.

545
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,300
I need one. One tooth.
- I'm okay.

546
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,394
No.. I'm okay.

547
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,631
Hold on.

548
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,604
Get off me.
- The blessing of tooth-fairy

549
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,336
Darling, spread your legs. Good.

550
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,747
Come on..

551
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,556
Was your mother also like this?

552
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,154
I remember nothing.

553
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,393
Except that there was someone..

554
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:16,400
...who would oil my
hair and tie a braid.

555
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,599
Must be my mother.

556
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,680
By the way, you forgot all
about the conditions and the reward.

557
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,514
Shivy never forgets anything.

558
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,677
And I can't collect my reward..

559
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,345
...without completing
all the conditions.

560
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,751
So...your third condition.

561
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,084
-Skate never {urges mo.-

562
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,095
I will tell you my
third condition too..

563
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,531
But when the time's right.

564
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,761
Crazy boy..

565
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,002
Marry this crazy boy.

566
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,095
I admit he is a bit stupid, a fool..

567
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,997
...but, he is one in a million.

568
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,669
Marry him.

569
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,541
Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes, marry him!

570
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,102
What a childish demand?

571
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,443
Marry him!

572
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,416
Dance girls don't get married.
- Why not?

573
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,111
Marry him.

574
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,553
You're a blue-blood, and I'm a harlot.

575
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,089
Marry him.

576
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,056
Our worlds are different, Shivy.

577
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,559
He will change everything, marry him.

578
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,390
Even if everything changes..

579
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,362
...It can't change the fact,
that I'm of a lower caste.

580
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,127
And...l am of a higher caste.

581
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,691
Scores settled.

582
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,171
You don't settle scores
in love like this.

583
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:27,073
There are no scores in love.

584
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,680
Get some sleep.

585
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,012
Will you then marry me?

586
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,356
When I wake up,
you'll be here...right?

587
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,533
Sitarat is only good for some fun.

588
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,100
Not for falling in love.

589
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,045
Don't try to find me.

590
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:40,507
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

591
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:50,617
"After all what's
the cure...for this pain?"

592
00:41:52,343 --> 00:42:00,626
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

593
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,264
Drinking on the streets?

594
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,535
You dare offend the law..

595
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:14,235
...that too in officer
Chatterjee's area? - What is..

596
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,708
...the punishment for this offence.
- 6 months of jail.

597
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,312
And...for breaking a heart

598
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:33,762
"I have hopes of
faithfulness from the one..."

599
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:43,599
"I have hopes of
faithfulness from the one..."

600
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:52,146
"I have hopes of
faithfulness from the one..."

601
00:42:52,202 --> 00:43:00,451
"who knows not what faith is"

602
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:10,429
"who knows not what faith is"

603
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:20,473
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

604
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,199
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

605
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,710
This is no time to drink tea.

606
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,076
Yeah, this is the
time to get high, rather.

607
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,622
Should I offer you some more liquor?

608
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,550
You brought me here to lecture me?

609
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,425
I took your father's advice.

610
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,132
If I find you lying somewhere..

611
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,024
...I should bring you home.

612
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,227
And so I did.

613
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,032
Why are you doing this?
For me?

614
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,130
Not for you...

615
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,201
for myself.

616
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,011
I need you.

617
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,575
There's something about you.
- What?

618
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,318
Something...that's rare
in humans these days.

619
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,388
It's only found in dogs.

620
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,560
You've a specialty,
and that's loyalty.

621
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,135
Whatever you do,
you do it with a tinge of loyalty.

622
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:58,333
Whether it was the trumpet, or Sitara.

623
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,269
What's the point?

624
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,110
She's gone.

625
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:08,277
She hasn't gone beyond
the moon and the stars, right?

626
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:13,054
There are some things,
which no matter how far they are...

627
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,487
...can be seen.

628
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,151
Moon and the stars are in the sky.

629
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,765
So why don't you
build a home in the sky?

630
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:31,601
High above...in the clouds.

631
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,567
And when you'll look down..

632
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,011
...she will be looking at you too.

633
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,540
But how will I get there?

634
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,082
On a plane.

635
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:50,024
Let's build a plane together.

636
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,491
Hold on. Okay.

637
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,227
Plane...
- Yes.

638
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,421
'Pushpak Vimaan.'
(Air borne plane)

639
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,523
People will use to travel around.

640
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,295
From here to there..

641
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,063
Like a flying ship.

642
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,401
Like a ship that sails on waten.

643
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,963
...similarly, an air-plane
that shall sail on clouds?

644
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,374
What did you say?

645
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,237
An air-plane.

646
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,010
An air-plane.

647
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,114
Wow! What a name?

648
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,685
Yes. Air-plane.

649
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,353
I was the one who consumed
liquor and you've gotten drunk.

650
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,657
No one's built an
air-plane in the world.

651
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,257
What a man!

652
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,209
I am sober again.

653
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:58,222
I am very close...yet quite far.

654
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,092
The English don't want
me to complete my invention.

655
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,529
They can kill me anytime.

656
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,659
Your life's in threat
because of an airplane.

657
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,136
It might be just an
airplane for the people.

658
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,231
A scientific marvel.

659
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:16,037
But it's a revolution for me.

660
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,978
It's the ray of hope,
which shall encourage..

661
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:21,482
...these enslaved people, that.

662
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,609
...we're as good as anyone else.

663
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,984
We can be independent too.

664
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,156
They can restrain us on earth.

665
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:34,256
But how can they stop
us from soaring in the sky?

666
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,358
Shivy, Indians will fly...

667
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,264
...towards an independent future.

668
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:43,567
The first flying man in
the world...will be an Indian.

669
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,105
That's my dream.

670
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,305
Would you like to see?

671
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,340
Would you like to see
my dream with your eyes?

672
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,287
Come on.

673
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,401
Now...jump-

674
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,599
Come on.

675
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,062
What are you saying?

676
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,471
It's nothing, Just go.
- No.

677
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,270
Put on your glasses.

678
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,315
Will you get me killed?

679
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,321
Pull the rope!

680
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,361
Pull the rope!

681
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,254
Shastn/ Ji, I am your assistant,
but who is mine.

682
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,587
You also need an assistant?

683
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,358
But who?

684
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,452
Shastn/ Ji, me!

685
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:12,585
"To shine like a star..."

686
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,359
"..you have to burn like one."

687
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:24,156
"To shine like a diamond..."

688
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:30,036
"Be ready to be cut like one."

689
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:35,572
“To be immortal like time...“

690
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:40,706
"You have to be on
a constant move."

691
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,389
Oh; isn't it the same book?

692
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,729
It's not just a book,
it's a treasure.

693
00:50:56,787 --> 00:51:02,066
Treasure full of details
about making an airplane.

694
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,596
I never showed it to anyone.

695
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,334
For I couldn't find
anyone trustworthy.

696
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,342
I built a steam-engine.

697
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,072
First with helium,
then I tried with nitrogen.

698
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:14,206
But everything failed .
Gasoline.

699
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,520
I need you, Shastn/ ji, not this book.

700
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,016
Keep trying out your ideas.

701
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,150
And I will be right beside you,
as your trusted aide.

702
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:35,130
But...the British should never
lay their hands on this book.

703
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,035
Remember that story. .?

704
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,404
...where the beast's heart
was in the parrot's body.

705
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,444
My head dwells in this.

706
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,677
I am alive as long as this exists.

707
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:48,181
If this is dead, so am I.

708
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:05,758
Heads!

709
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,193
This is cheating. You always win.

710
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:11,068
Look...we can toss the coin..

711
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,405
...but only He decides whether
it'll be heads or tails.

712
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:17,240
When it's your turn to fly..

713
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,281
...this coin will definitely favor you.

714
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,613
Where did these dark clouds come from?

715
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,583
It can't be gasoline.

716
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,019
From Lanka to Ayodhya, how could Lord
Ram not encounter any dark clouds?

717
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,522
It's clearly written
in the scriptures.

718
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,526
Light yellow is fuel's
colour... It's not a name.

719
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,491
So you know think more than me?

720
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,394
All I know is that we're depending
too much on the scriptures.

721
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:46,491
Trying to build an air-plane
based on old mythological books?

722
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,341
Meaning...year 1200

723
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,671
1000.

724
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,769
8 miles..

725
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,105
And Bhanu..
- I know.. Sun!

726
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,376
Now multiply all three.

727
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,384
1200x1000x8... what do we have?

728
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,578
9,60,00,000 miles.

729
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,279
The distance between earth and sun.

730
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:07,686
And these things are mentioned.

731
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,191
...In a mythological
book like these.

732
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,492
Mr. Shastn/mthese
things can impress kids..

733
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,189
...but can't make an air-plane fly.

734
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,756
You don't trust me, do you?
- No, I don't.

735
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,127
So leave.
- Fine...l am going.

736
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,295
Leave.

737
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,301
Trying to teach me!

738
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,521
So you're back.

739
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,058
Back in 4.5 hours.

740
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,293
Last time you took 6.

741
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,220
Don't make me furious,
or I'll leave again.

742
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:50,688
So go.

743
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,461
Who's stopping you?
Leave now.

744
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,126
You go. - This is my house,
why should I?

745
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,794
What are you saying?
- Be quiet.

746
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:04,077
When did this arrive?
You didn't tell me.

747
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,408
There's nothing to say.

748
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:11,248
The king of Baroda
has denied our request.

749
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:18,121
Shivy...seems like our
destiny is out for a stroll.

750
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:24,455
Shastn/ ji, one shouldn't
depend on destiny too much.

751
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:28,594
Even the unfortunate do have a fate.

752
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,265
You don't look stupid, but you are.

753
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,004
Man will fly.

754
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,247
Fairytale.

755
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:43,341
In real life,
fain/tales don't come true.

756
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,510
I am sorry,
I don't believe in your claims.

757
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,119
But you believe in Lord Ram, right?

758
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,351
The 'Pushpak Vimaan'..

759
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:53,519
...In which Lord Ram
flew from Lanka to Ayodhya.

760
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,460
You're talking about mythology.

761
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,496
Myth...

762
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,690
That's a lie.
Unfortunately, your highness.

763
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:03,033
These stories have
no relation with reality.

764
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,629
Even we've read in scriptures.

765
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,300
That God's could
communicate from a distance.

766
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,737
And Graham Bell's telephone
does the same thing.

767
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,639
Railways,
motor cars...phonogram, telegram.

768
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,046
All these fain/tales
are now coming true.

769
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,346
Because we're unraveling
the mysteries behind them.

770
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,114
Mysteries will keep unraveling..

771
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,086
...and slowly all these
tales will turn into reality.

772
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:25,559
His highness,
if what we built wasn't commendable..

773
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:29,324
...then the British
wouldn't be after us.

774
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,758
You mean...the English are ignorant.

775
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,593
...and you two are smart

776
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:40,369
Have we ever built
anything before them?

777
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:49,278
An/abhatt invented 'Zero'
before the rest of the world.

778
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,409
'Zero'.

779
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,546
Saint Kannad...discovered an
'Atom' before the rest of the world.

780
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,555
'Atom.'

781
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,684
5,000 years ago,
Diamond was discovered in India.

782
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,525
And I reckon the British...
didn't even exist back then.

783
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,065
Your Highness, do you know..

784
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,624
...why fain/tales
don't turn into reality?

785
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,693
Because in a haste to grow up..

786
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,201
...we forget to think like kids.

787
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,176
Man shall fly... an air-plane shall fly.

788
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,611
We just need your help
to turn this tale into reality.

789
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,343
And yes...we're not stupid.

790
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,243
Just a little eccentric.

791
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,315
How much money do
these eccentrics need?

792
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,459
"Bless me with your grace."

793
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,087
"Lord smiles through your face."

794
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:41,033
"A stone turns into
a gem at your place."

795
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:46,199
"With your mere touch
you change people's fates"

796
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:50,733
"You are a saint with Godly traitsq"

797
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:05,352
"Cannons will be fired...in our honor."

798
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:09,694
"And those cannons will be official"

799
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,466
"Cannons will be fired...in our honor."

800
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:20,169
"Those cannons will be official"

801
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:25,605
"Someday our faces..."

802
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:31,077
"will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real"

803
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:41,720
"will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real"

804
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:54,297
"You and only you"

805
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:59,370
"You are the pen as well
as the ink in which it is dipped"

806
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,473
"You are the alphabet
as well as the script)"

807
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,419
"You are the kingdom as well its king"

808
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,218
"You are benevolent, as well as cruel"

809
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:14,251
"You are free as well as like
a bird which has lost its wing"

810
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,025
"You're the punishment
and the relief."

811
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,532
"You are happiness as well as grief"

812
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:24,402
"You are the whole
army as well as its chief"

813
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:41,747
"Along with the Sun we
will enjoy biscuits and bun)"

814
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:49,556
"Moon will also get addicted
to Cutting chai coz it will be fun)"

815
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:59,597
"From the shelf of the
sky...we'll pick some stars."

816
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:04,644
"Turning them into lanterns"

817
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:09,411
"...we shall hang them on our door"

818
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:14,215
"Wear the goggles
of dreams on your eyes"

819
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:19,225
"The world will become
a miraculous place, it's a deal"

820
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:24,529
"Wear the goggles
of dreams on your eyes"

821
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:29,436
"The world will become a
miraculous place, it's a deal)"

822
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,599
"Someday our faces..."

823
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:38,341
"...will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real"

824

"Bless me with your grace."

825
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,178
"Lord smiles through your face."

01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,776
"A stone turns into
a gem at your place."

827
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,545
"...will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real"

828
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:53,321
"With your mere touch
you change people's fates"

829
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:58,560
"You are a saint with Godly traits."

830
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:10,404
"...will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real"

831
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,384
Move. Move...what's going on?

832
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,260
Quiet!

833
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,432
It's not a bomb,
it's a flying machine.

834
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:39,131
That's what my sources have told me.

835
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,799
And that too, based on the Vedas.

836
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,305
That's what my sources
have told me, sir.

837
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,506
Wilson...l believe
you're up for promotion.

838
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:51,243
And if my sources are right,
be prepared for a transfer.

839
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:55,184
Sir...monkeys cannot make machines.

840
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,520
At least not without metal.

841
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,684
Sir...

842
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,620
Let me see how will the plane fly...?

843
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,098
No one will sell metal to us.

844
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:15,199
No shopkeeper or any junk-seller.

845
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,266
A monkey can stop jumping around..

846
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,472
...but the British will
never stop interfering.

847
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,745
How will I build the wings now?

848
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,051
With my..
- Let's use wood?

849
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:33,488
Who are you writing to? Your mother?

850
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:40,399
Why don't you ever post it?

851
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,629
I told you 'Wood'.

852
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,137
Don't worn].

853
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,368
I'll post it when the time's right.

854
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:50,540
Whenever I talk to him..

855
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,807
...It feels like I
am talking to a mirror.

856
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,445
Me as well...

857
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,614
I couldn't say anything either.

858
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,193
Come on,
we'll make the wings out of wood.

859
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,628
We made it of wood the last time.

860
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,358
But it broke under the weight.

861
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:15,692
What do I do with the king's money?

862
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,397
The British never learn,
so we won't either.

863
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,339
No one will sell metal to you..

864
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,707
...but, they will certainly
tender you coins.

865
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,006
Coins?

866
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,716
Sir, it's considered sacred.
Melting it would be a sin. - I know.

867
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,485
I will be the sinner.

868
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:41,222
Make it in this shape.

869
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,122
It'll be done!

870
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,201
Father...

871
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:00,040
Give the young man first.
- No, no.

872
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:02,548
Sir, guests are like God.

873
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:06,382
If you don't eat,
then I'll be the sinner for sure.

874
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:08,149
Go on.

875
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:11,351
I'll eat.
But first...do you go to school?

876
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,757
She's in class 2.

877
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,087
What's your name?
- Sitara.

878
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,560
Recite the bird poem for him.

879
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,593
Collecting little by little.
She delicately makes her nest.

880
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:27,698
Smiles through winters,
summers and rains.

881
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:31,074
Smiles in even] test.

882
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:35,072
Sitara Devi...l finished building it.

883
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,148
It's ready.

884
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,684
When I pour gasoline...
the engine will start to roar.

885
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,384
And this thing will churn around,
cutting through the wind.

886
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:46,424
And due the air pressure,
the air-plane..

887
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:47,722
...will fly up in the air.

888
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,561
Everyone shall applaud .

889
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:55,667
But I didn't come
here to tell you that?

890
01:04:57,426 --> 01:05:02,000
I came here to say that...
I feel scared.

891
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,070
Very scared .

892
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,442
This time when you come
back I won't let you leave.

893
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,678
Can't you come back?

894
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,695
Come back!

895
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,461
Come back!

896
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,369
What are you wearing, Mr. Shastnj.

897
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,414
Wear this green coat today.

898
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:41,504
No.

899
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:46,686
I'll wear that the clay
I'll take-off in the air-plane.

900
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:52,548
Or the day I fly off myself.

901
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,791
This one's fine for today.

902
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,192
Come on.

903
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,738
What happened?

904
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,243
Will it fly high enough so that.

905
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,011
...Sitara can watch it from anywhere?

906
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:20,083
Hey...You said so.

907
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:27,024
At 10:22...the sunrays will
make a 48 degree triangle.

908
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,223
...and the gasoline
will boil in the engine.

909
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:34,028
The air-plane will
fly...at exactly 10:22.

910
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,570
On that note...say cheese!

911
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,265
Glory to..
- Tilak!

912
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,535
Glory to..
- Tilak!

913
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:43,076
Glory to..
- Tilak!

914
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,112
Glory to..
- Mother India!

915
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,669
Tilak!
- Yes.

916
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,680
I heard an air-plane's
going to fly here.

917
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,116
Did you see it?

918
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,345
Hope it didn't take-off yet?

919
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:56,451
You're here to see our air-plane?

920
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:01,326
No...to witness the
first flight of freedom.

921
01:10:37,699 --> 01:10:39,645
Sir, why do you think the
Viceroy called us here?

922
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:41,807
I'm very sure it's
about those two Indians.

923
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,040
I warned you about them.

924
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,682
Good morning, your highness.

925
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:55,593
Still biter..
- Do you know why, Governor?

926
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:01,733
India is a poor land
of uneducated tribal's..

927
01:11:01,823 --> 01:11:04,394
...and snake charmers and Sadhus.

928
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,030
In colonizing, it is we..

929
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,502
...who have done them a favor.

930
01:11:08,563 --> 01:11:12,568
It's taken us years to
paint that image in the west.

931
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,443
And if a news like this gets out now..

932
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:16,415
...that image will be shattered.

933
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:19,350
It seems to me,
that right under your bloody noses...

934
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:20,944
...these Indians have been building..

935
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:22,955
...some kind of flying machine.

936
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,649
And what have you been doing?

937
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:25,987
Snoring.

938
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,356
Captain,
put him behind bars immediately.

939
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:32,365
And what?
Make him into a national hero?

940
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:35,931
You need to be clever,
but I want that book.

941
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,768
I want my tea to taste sweet.

942
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,875
Give me the number six spanner.

943
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,811
Kaka, the number six spanner.

944
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:55,447
Shastn/ Ji,
I can handle this simple machine.

945
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:57,649
But you take charge
of that complex one.

946
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,453
I wonder what he's doing.

947
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:00,754
-Skate! Skate!-

948
01:12:03,885 --> 01:12:08,356
Shivy! Two tickets for Kolkata.

949
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,559
Tagore's called for us.

950
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,935
He wants to honor us.

951
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:18,940
Shivy...tell me something.

952
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:24,483
Are you sure...it was her.

953
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,878
Fine...
Narayan, are you finished yet?

954
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:33,050
Hurry up... We've to go
find an aunt for your uncle.

955
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,624
For the wedding you'll
need money, sir.

956
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:41,327
Two rupees...is that
what they are paying for..

957
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,994
The Star Inventor!

958
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:46,437
A National Hero, is it?

959
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,641
What do you say to 5000 rupees..

960
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,835
...with a single stroke of the pen.

961
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,012
I need the book.

962
01:12:53,935 --> 01:12:59,476
And I think...right now
you need something to eat.

963
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,315
Samosa!

964
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:08,293
Too hot.

965
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,593
Hot means steaming
hot...or hot means spicy.

966
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:12,927
Miser Englishmen.

967
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:15,730
They make a single
word do the work of two!

968
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:21,865
But thankfully, we've two words.

969
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:26,537
You choose one, yes or no!

970
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:30,572
Mr. Shastnj, 6000 is the
absolute limit I can offer you.

971
01:13:30,605 --> 01:13:33,950
The most I can offer you is this.

972
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:35,317
'Jalebi'.

973
01:13:36,244 --> 01:13:39,953
I will take it, but the Viceroy
won't take no for an answer.

974
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:42,621
Othervvise...He'll make
your life the way you like it.

975
01:13:42,717 --> 01:13:45,459
Hot and spicy.

976
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,928
Good day to you, Mr. Shastnj.

977
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,560
Good day, sir.

978
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:59,711
Shivy...a simple machine..

979
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:02,372
...tightened the noose
around their neck.

980
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,744
When we really fly on a plane..

981
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:06,945
...then they will..

982
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:10,615
Freak out in their rants
and leak out in their pants!

983
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:20,391
Don't let this chance go by.

984
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,663
Or you will be fixing
machines all your life like me.

985
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:23,735
Run!

986
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,692
-Where's Skate'?-

987
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:56,630
One star sets and the other rises.

988
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,534
That's the tradition here.

989
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,737
-Where's Skate'?-

990
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:05,535
It's easier to find
the address of clouds.

991
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,976
A particular lane...or an area maybe.

992
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,773
But dance girls are difficult to find.

993
01:15:11,806 --> 01:15:13,342
-Where's Skate'?-

994
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:39,535
The day she stopped performing...
we bid her farewell.

995
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:44,779
Come on, Champa. Your entry.

996
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:56,590
6/17...Patil Chowk. Dadar

997
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:13,436
"I offer my life to you."

998
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:20,909
"I offer my life to you."

999
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:28,759
"I offer my life to you."

1000
01:16:28,783 --> 01:16:38,636
"I don't know anything
else as a prayer?"

1001
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:48,637
“O naive heart...what's befallen you?“

1002
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:52,948
Haven't got rid of the habit
of climbing through windows?

1003
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,620
You never made a relation
that allowed me through the door.

1004
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:58,822
Why did you leave?

1005
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:02,886
You had fallen in love with me.

1006
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,731
Wanted to marn/ me.

1007
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:06,992
And you?

1008
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:09,997
It may be easier to bind water.

1009
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:13,628
But dance girls don't get married...

1010
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:15,642
So why did you come back that day?

1011
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:21,013
That wasn't the first day...you
just spotted me that day.

1012
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,407
I noticed you many times.

1013
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:24,415
...In the market with Shastn/ ji.

1014
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:29,517
I even stood under your window.
- Why didn't you come up?

1015
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:34,751
I couldn't climb up pipes, like you,

1016
01:17:39,754 --> 01:17:45,227
Maybe dance girls don't,
but cotton-cleaners do get married.

1017
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,907
Marry him.

1018
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:50,538
I am not beautiful anymore.

1019
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:51,873
You never were.

1020
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,277
Marry him.

1021
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:57,748
I no longer have the same grace,
or attitude.

1022
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,409
Marry him.

1023
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:01,944
I am neck-deep in debt.
- Marry him.

1024
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,614
You built an air-plane.
- Marry him.

1025
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:04,918
The first one in the world.
- Marry him.

1026
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:06,892
Your pictures get
published in the papers.

1027
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,292
I will leave everything.
Marry me.

1028
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:11,762
Marry me.

1029
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:32,612
-Skate 11...-

1030
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:34,415
-Skate!-

1031
01:18:35,276 --> 01:18:37,415
Can I get some more time?

1032
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:38,856
I've run out of pages of my ledger..

1033
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:42,326
...but you don't seem to
run out of time to repay my debt.

1034
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,295
You say you don't have money.

1035
01:18:45,653 --> 01:18:47,655
And here you are..
- Brother..

1036
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:50,601
Hands to yourself.
- Old flame?

1037
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:52,735
I am not new to her either.

1038
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:53,933
Didn't you tell him?

1039
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:57,239
Unpaid rent for three years.

1040
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,438
Food, clothing...etcetera.

1041
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,003
Women are expensive to maintain.

1042
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:01,976
Yeah.

1043
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,649
Fine. You don't have money, right?

1044
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:09,255
So...how about doing
me some favor too.

1045
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,348
Hey..
Just tell me the figures.

1046
01:19:12,847 --> 01:19:15,020
4,332 rupees is the principal.

1047
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:17,262
You can add up the
interest on your own!

1048
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,959
It happens.

1049
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:59,398
It often happens.

1050
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:08,497
And then...l am not different
enough to escape this fate.

1051
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:13,002
I had to trust someone.

1052
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:15,909
Don't be sad.

1053
01:21:19,707 --> 01:21:22,381
I didn't feel offended.

1054
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,986
I am also human after all.

1055
01:21:31,986 --> 01:21:34,990
Shedding tears are normal.

1056
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:58,984
So much money...

1057
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,786
Where?

1058
01:22:11,492 --> 01:22:12,596
Shivy?

1059
01:22:28,876 --> 01:22:32,016
Naru, where's Shashtri ji?

1060
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,950
He left in the morning
wearing his green English coat.

1061
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,354
I thought.

1062
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,798
'I will wear this the day
I take off in the air-plane.'

1063
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,961
'Or the day...l fly myself.'

1064
01:22:51,632 --> 01:22:52,702
Kaka!

1065
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,575
Kaka!

1066
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:38,681
Shastn/ ji?

1067
01:24:41,809 --> 01:24:46,815
My friend, my guru, my teacher..

1068
01:24:48,382 --> 01:24:51,727
He believed in me when
Even I didn't believe in myself.

1069
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,826
And do you know what I did?

1070
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,632
I shattered his faith.

1071
01:25:00,027 --> 01:25:03,338
I stole his book which
was dearer to him than his life.

1072
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,006
And killed a man...

1073
01:25:07,401 --> 01:25:08,744
...who gave me my identity.

1074
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:13,447
I am a murderer.

1075
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:15,520
I am a murderer.

1076
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,590
I am a murderer.
I am a murderer.

1077
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,421
I am a murderer.

1078
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:46,616
Kaka.

1079
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:49,647
Why did you come here?

1080
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,423
Don't you know I am a thief?

1081
01:25:51,512 --> 01:25:52,957
Go. Go home now!

1082
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,294
You did it for me, Shivy.

1083
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,759
I am the murderer, not you.

1084
01:26:04,892 --> 01:26:06,929
What did you bring?
- Nothing.

1085
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:08,905
What's written on that paper?

1086
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:10,771
That your uncle is a murderer.

1087
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:18,283
I brought offerings for you.

1088
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:22,584
And that will happen..

1089
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:27,590
...only when you fulfill
Shastn/ ji's dreams.

1090
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:31,627
Shastn/ Ji said,
"Never leave your uncle,

1091
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,723
Don't ever leave him".

1092
01:26:33,754 --> 01:26:35,756
"Am I your Shivy, right?"

1093
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,676
'l need you.'

1094
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,839
Shivy, you will have
to build the airplane.

1095
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,747
For me...for yourself.

1096
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,548
-For Shasky '31.-

1097
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:57,647
'At any cost,
you will have to do this.'

1098
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:06,692
Tell your uncle,
on 7th November at 9:24 am..

1099
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,361
...the winds will blow from the sea.

1100
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,462
The airplane shall fly.

1101
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,406
And this is my third condition.

1102
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:32,520
"From the hunter's clutches..."

1103
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:40,598
"Beyond the cage and its crutches"

1104
01:27:40,621 --> 01:27:43,568
"From the hunter's clutches..."

1105
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:45,535
"Beyond the cage and its crutches"

1106
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:49,871
"He'll flap his wings
and soar into the sky."

1107
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:54,242
"He'll flap his wings
and soar into the sky."

1108
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:58,784
"Across the clouds, and fast
like the lightening, it will go high"

1109
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:05,950
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1110
01:28:07,381 --> 01:28:14,799
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1111
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:23,471
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1112
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:31,876
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1113
01:28:41,982 --> 01:28:48,592
'The day it's your turn to fly,
this coin will definitely fly alone.'

1114
01:29:12,913 --> 01:29:18,864
"Sharpen your all your weapons."

1115
01:29:19,553 --> 01:29:24,263
"Sharpen your all your weapons."

1116
01:29:25,926 --> 01:29:27,872
"We'll live our dreams too."

1117
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:30,442
"We'll shape it with hard work."

1118
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,340
"We'll live our dreams too."

1119
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,676
"We'll shape it with hard work."

1120
01:29:34,735 --> 01:29:40,515
"You're one in a million."

1121
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:47,790
"You're one in a million."

1122
01:29:47,848 --> 01:29:54,663
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1123
01:29:56,624 --> 01:30:03,735
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1124
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:12,282
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1125
01:30:13,974 --> 01:30:20,949
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1126
01:30:22,716 --> 01:30:30,362
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1127
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:58,827
I am sure it's not gasoline.

1128
01:31:02,823 --> 01:31:05,929
Out of money and no clue of the fuel.

1129
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:08,507
Whether I make this airplane or not..

1130
01:31:08,562 --> 01:31:11,543
...But I will definitely
make a new record for failing.

1131
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:17,407
Are you asleep?

1132
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:19,713
With your glasses on?

1133
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,414
Dreams seem clearer.

1134
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:26,817
What are you thinking?

1135
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:30,690
Building a toy is one thing..

1136
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:33,891
...but building a real
airplane is different.

1137
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:36,332
And making it fly.

1138
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:37,668
What?

1139
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:39,869
I mean...a person will sit in it.

1140
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:41,600
So the weight will be double.

1141
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:43,973
How can gasoline make it fly?

1142
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:47,569
A mouse can run on peanuts,
but not an elephant.

1143
01:31:47,968 --> 01:31:50,505
So...how will this fly?

1144
01:31:51,438 --> 01:31:52,644
You don't know.

1145
01:31:52,706 --> 01:31:55,277
But there must be someone..

1146
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:58,352
...who knows what fuel
will this plane use?

1147
01:31:58,379 --> 01:31:59,790
You're correct.

1148
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:03,585
Shastn/ ji often
used to mention a name..

1149
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,497
Charu Saraswati!

1150
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:34,955
Charu Ji.

1151
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:38,252
Charu Ji.

1152
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:50,669
If you want fuel, then you'll
have to answer my five questions.

1153
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:53,338
...In the opposite way.

1154
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:55,573
Not wrong, but opposite.

1155
01:33:00,507 --> 01:33:05,013
If you answer any question correctly,
I will leave.

1156
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,024
First question?

1157
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:11,286
What's essential
for humans to survive?

1158
01:33:11,318 --> 01:33:13,298
Air or water?

1159
01:33:14,288 --> 01:33:15,460
Hope.

1160
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:20,604
What hurts the most?

1161
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,501
Lies or humiliation?

1162
01:33:23,897 --> 01:33:25,433
Disloyalty.

1163
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:28,437
What is more frightful?

1164
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,846
Death or poverty?

1165
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:32,911
Failure!

1166
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,381
Your fifth question is?

1167
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:41,757
No, it's the fourth, not fifth?

1168
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:45,820
You lost?
- How?

1169
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:47,593
You gave the right answer.

1170
01:33:48,622 --> 01:33:51,432
This is cheating.
Absolutely unfair.

1171
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:55,473
Mr. Shastn/ respected you, and..
- You? Shivy?

1172
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:57,401
Shivy?

1173
01:33:57,865 --> 01:34:00,436
Shastn/ had told me that
you will definitely come.

1174
01:34:00,934 --> 01:34:04,973
He said you will unravel
the mysteries that he couldn't.

1175
01:34:05,839 --> 01:34:08,285
I could never understand.

1176
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:12,950
Whether he loved you
or believed in you more.

1177
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:16,459
Are you his son?

1178
01:34:16,684 --> 01:34:17,856
Yes.

1179
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:20,293
A useless son of a talented father.

1180
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,966
Even I don't know the solutions, son.

1181
01:34:29,329 --> 01:34:33,744
The scriptures only have questions,
not answers.

1182
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:37,806
The answers lie within us.

1183
01:34:38,605 --> 01:34:41,848
It flows...but it's not water.

1184
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:45,786
It shines...but it's not silver.

1185
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:50,622
4121...the fuel.

1186
01:34:52,619 --> 01:34:55,293
Go...fly your airplane!

1187
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:56,699
Fly your airplane!

1188
01:34:56,724 --> 01:35:00,501
Fly your airplane!
Go. Fly your airplane!

1189
01:35:00,594 --> 01:35:02,403
Fly your airplane!

1190
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:03,533
Go.

1191
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:12,447
-Kaka. Skate Devi.-

1192
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:14,608
Happy Dussera.
- Happy Dussera.

1193
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:16,745
So poor Ravan's been killed.

1194
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:19,717
Your Kaka doesn't know..

1195
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:23,023
...that Ravan is slain, not killed.

1196
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,586
Naru, hand me that hammer.

1197
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:27,326
No hammer, just gold.

1198
01:35:27,387 --> 01:35:29,526
Happy Dussera.

1199
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:34,303
It looks amazing, Kaka.

1200
01:35:34,394 --> 01:35:36,601
Our airplane will look like this.

1201
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:39,268
Your Sitara Devi doesn't know..

1202
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:42,837
...one needs lots of
gold to build an airplane.

1203
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:45,415
The real one, not fake.

1204
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:49,650
You stole it?

1205
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:53,653
Sitara Devi, doesn't
your Shivy know..

1206
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:56,591
...taking something from
your own house, isn't stealing.

1207
01:35:56,683 --> 01:35:58,856
I'll knock some sense into you.

1208
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:01,992
Shastn/ Ji's airplane won't
be built with filthy money.

1209
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,799
Then how will we build it, Kaka?

1210
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:09,498
Using some old pans...
and some old acquaintances!

1211
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:13,342
Hello.
I am Shivkar Talpade.

1212
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:14,969
Go on.
- And I am Narayan Talpade.

1213
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:17,004
We're about to build
the world's first airplane..

1214
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:18,044
...and humans can fly in it.

1215
01:36:18,338 --> 01:36:20,750
We politely request you
to lend us all the help you can.

1216
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:22,684
Come on.
- Oh yeah!

1217
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,016
Airplane.
- Yeah.

1218
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:26,354
Humans will fly!
- Yes.

1219
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:29,725
Go find someone else.

1220
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:31,752
Hello..

1221
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:33,627
I am Shivkar Talpade.
- And I am Narayan Talpade.

1222
01:36:33,654 --> 01:36:36,863
We're about to build the world's first
airplane and humans can fly in it.

1223
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:37,800
Hello..

1224
01:36:37,891 --> 01:36:38,961
I am Shivkar Talpade.

1225
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:40,704
Hello..
I am Shivkar Talpade.

1226
01:36:40,794 --> 01:36:41,829
Wait.

1227
01:36:41,895 --> 01:36:43,602
Wait.
- Aunty..

1228
01:36:47,734 --> 01:36:49,611
Trying to cast a new spell or what?

1229
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:54,686
I have just a few days till 7th.

1230
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:57,754
It's now...or never.

1231
01:36:57,845 --> 01:36:59,825
What's so special with 7th November?

1232
01:36:59,913 --> 01:37:01,824
Shastn/ ji's experience and knowledge.

1233
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:04,295
The day...the time...high-tide, low-tide..

1234
01:37:04,384 --> 01:37:05,624
Speed of air, moisture...

1235
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:06,994
It's not that easy
to understand all that.

1236
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:10,360
For that,
one needs to understand the universe.

1237
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:12,459
And Shastry ji was an expert at that.

1238
01:37:12,492 --> 01:37:14,403
Not me!

1239
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:17,809
Building an airplane
is not my cup of tea.

1240
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:20,573
I don't know whether it is or not?

1241
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:23,641
But I've heard that a man in love..

1242
01:37:24,304 --> 01:37:27,842
...often does things beyond his limits.

1243
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,053
Don't expect anything anymore.

1244
01:37:35,582 --> 01:37:37,858
Neither money or nor praise.

1245
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:43,266
Your airplane's has pricked
the eyes of the British.

1246
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:45,463
Come on, your highness,
the tiger's waiting.

1247
01:37:45,559 --> 01:37:47,004
Just a minute, sir.

1248
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:54,971
I am an enslaved king
of an enslaved country.

1249
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:58,375
I've to hunt down the
tigers of my own jungle..

1250
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:02,251
...only for the sake
of their happiness.

1251
01:38:05,612 --> 01:38:07,819
Not sure if history will forgive me...

1252
01:38:08,815 --> 01:38:12,592
...but you please find
the head to forgive me.

1253
01:38:14,254 --> 01:38:15,631
Best of luck!

1254
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:22,739
"Bless me with your grace."

1255
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:31,946
"You're my benefactor
on this journey."

1256
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:41,287
"You can turn stones into diamonds."

1257
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:44,256
Won't fly.

1258
01:38:45,485 --> 01:38:47,465
Our airplane will never fly.

1259
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,765
Let's do one thing.

1260
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,463
Let's pick a chit.

1261
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:14,617
Shastn/ ji was right.

1262
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:17,462
Our fate's gone out for a stroll.

1263
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:22,567
Leave it. It will be the
opposite of what is written here.

1264
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:23,795
Shivy!

1265
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:30,464
It Will fly!

1266
01:39:31,698 --> 01:39:33,803
Which means I chose 'It won't fly'.

1267
01:39:35,268 --> 01:39:37,680
Our airplane will never fly.

1268
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:40,583
It Will.

1269
01:39:42,342 --> 01:39:44,288
My dear friend,
since you build your airplane..

1270
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,348
...You forgot all
about your old friends.

1271
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:51,489
And I heard that...you're
building a big airplane.

1272
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:54,828
No, Khan Sahib. I tried my best.

1273
01:39:55,288 --> 01:39:56,858
And now I've run out of
all my money and my courage.

1274
01:39:56,923 --> 01:39:58,698
What are you saying?

1275
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:00,669
Then you will have
to come home with me.

1276
01:40:00,761 --> 01:40:04,641
My 6 year old son keeps
telling his school friends..

1277
01:40:04,731 --> 01:40:07,644
...that his father used to play
in the band with Shivkar Talpade.

1278
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,510
You're his hero.

1279
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:12,607
And I don't have the
courage to tell him..

1280
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,880
...that his hero's
lost all his courage.

1281
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:16,750
You only tell him if you can.

1282
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:18,347
You don't know, but..

1283
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:22,257
“You're the only free Indian
of this enslaved country. Only one.

1284
01:40:22,315 --> 01:40:24,818
You're the one who
gives us courage, hope.

1285
01:40:24,885 --> 01:40:27,331
Of an independent tomorrow.

1286
01:40:27,387 --> 01:40:32,837
You will have to fly. For us.

1287
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:35,603
For the workers that
toil in the mills.

1288
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:37,039
The labors that build bridges.

1289
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:39,276
For the arms that pull the rickshaw.

1290
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:41,870
For we lndians...you will have to fly.

1291
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:45,940
How, Khan Sir? This is all I have.

1292
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:51,346
Will the airplane fly with this?
- It will.

1293
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,920
Your airplane will definitely fly.

1294
01:40:56,049 --> 01:40:57,790
Look.

1295
01:40:57,884 --> 01:41:01,889
The entire neighbourhood
saved this...for Haj.

1296
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:05,465
Go fly your airplane.

1297
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:09,003
We'll consider our Haj done.

1298
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:12,501
And if that's not enough,
then take this too.

1299
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:16,473
We poor people have a big heart

1300
01:41:17,437 --> 01:41:21,044
Will you fly your airplane now?
- Of course he will.

1301
01:41:21,741 --> 01:41:23,015
Want to bet 50 paise on it?

1302
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:25,654
Atleast now raise your
standard to a rupee bet.

1303
01:41:35,455 --> 01:41:37,594
"Your prayers..."

1304
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:39,763
"Your prayers..."

1305
01:41:39,826 --> 01:41:41,931
"Your prayers..."

1306
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:44,339
"Your prayers..."

1307
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:48,641
"I bowed,
I kneeled...l even prayed secretly."

1308
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:53,275
"I bowed,
I kneeled...l even prayed secretly."

1309
01:41:53,306 --> 01:41:55,513
"I stopped and prayed."

1310
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,850
"I knelt and prayed."

1311
01:41:57,911 --> 01:42:02,519
"The nomad in me has
surrendered to you..."

1312
01:42:02,549 --> 01:42:06,827
"The nomad in me has
surrendered to you..."

1313
01:42:06,853 --> 01:42:08,992
"No sense of dying."

1314
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:11,400
"No sense of dying."

1315
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:15,804
"No sense of dying...nor of living."

1316
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:21,869
"The nomad in me has
surrendered to you..."

1317
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:37,326
"With hope can/ed on my tools..."

1318
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:41,763
"With hope can/ed on my tools..."

1319
01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:44,394
"I have put pans
of my dreams onto it..."

1320
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:47,028
"I have put pans
of my dreams onto it..."

1321
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:52,841
"This simple wood needs
to travel the world..."

1322
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:57,473
"This simple wood needs"
to travel the world...

1323
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,541
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1324
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:01,778
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1325
01:43:01,808 --> 01:43:03,947
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1326
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:06,513
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1327
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,651
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1328
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:11,025
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1329
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:19,732
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1330
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:27,502
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1331
01:43:28,868 --> 01:43:36,685
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1332
01:43:37,677 --> 01:43:45,357
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1333
01:43:46,586 --> 01:43:54,869
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1334
01:43:55,595 --> 01:44:02,012
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1335
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:11,549
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1336
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:19,895
Accounts! Accounts! Accounts!

1337
01:44:19,919 --> 01:44:21,592
I need to finish these accounts today.

1338
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:23,793
Gokhle. Where's Gokhle?

1339
01:44:23,823 --> 01:44:25,393
Gokhle.

1340
01:44:25,792 --> 01:44:27,772
Godbole..

1341
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:32,835
Narayan!

1342
01:44:33,466 --> 01:44:34,536
Narayan!

1343
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:38,641
What's this?

1344
01:44:38,872 --> 01:44:40,408
What's this?

1345
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,887
Look, Narayan...no airplane
can fly without fuel.

1346
01:44:44,444 --> 01:44:46,355
Your uncle is crazy.

1347
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:50,259
And you're even
crazier to believe him.

1348
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:51,990
You might be crazy.

1349
01:44:52,018 --> 01:44:53,998
My uncle is not crazy.

1350
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,000
He's not!
My uncle is not crazy.

1351
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:57,894
Narayan!

1352
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:01,328
Forget it, Mohan.

1353
01:45:01,861 --> 01:45:03,670
He's just a kid.

1354
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:04,970
No, father.

1355
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:08,375
You can live without your son..

1356
01:45:10,503 --> 01:45:12,312
But not me.

1357
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:14,848
I can't live without him.

1358
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:17,655
I can't live without him.

1359
01:45:23,616 --> 01:45:25,459
You want promotion, don't you?

1360
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:29,561
Promotion?

1361
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:32,727
I have a piece of information.

1362
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:47,982
Naru...l know what's 4121..

1363
01:45:48,007 --> 01:45:49,543
True

1364
01:45:49,776 --> 01:45:51,619
F for four F for fodder.

1365
01:45:52,245 --> 01:45:55,590
1 plus -2- makes 12.
An animal with 12 horns.

1366
01:45:55,615 --> 01:46:04,558
When the animal would eat this fodder,
he will poop put the fuel.

1367
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:08,632
Kaka, everything's a joke for you.

1368
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:15,309
Narayan,
no matter what you do in life..

1369
01:46:15,402 --> 01:46:16,710
Be a Doctor, Lawyer..

1370
01:46:16,803 --> 01:46:19,477
...Collector...anything.

1371
01:46:19,572 --> 01:46:20,915
But don't ever on].

1372
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,817
You know why?

1373
01:46:23,376 --> 01:46:26,687
Crying doesn't change anything.

1374
01:46:26,746 --> 01:46:30,387
Look at me.
The teacher chucked me out..

1375
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,525
...and I left with a smile.

1376
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:35,658
I found Sitara...and I smiled.

1377
01:46:36,423 --> 01:46:39,961
Father threw me out of the house,
and I still smiled.

1378
01:46:40,493 --> 01:46:42,495
Shastn/ ji said "Let's fly"..

1379
01:46:42,529 --> 01:46:43,633
...and I still smiled.

1380
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:45,939
I even built an airplane. Smiled.

1381
01:46:46,232 --> 01:46:48,735
There was just one
time I didn't smile.

1382
01:46:50,236 --> 01:46:52,011
When Shastn/ ji passed away.

1383
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:55,944
I cried.

1384
01:46:57,377 --> 01:47:00,824
But...did that change a thing?

1385
01:47:03,683 --> 01:47:05,856
That's why I say...smile!

1386
01:47:05,885 --> 01:47:07,421
Laugh aloud..
- Uncle..

1387
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:08,626
Laugh!

1388
01:47:08,655 --> 01:47:10,032
Uncle..
- Come.

1389
01:47:10,256 --> 01:47:13,601
But Kaka, fuel?
- We'll figure something out.

1390
01:47:13,693 --> 01:47:14,831
Uncle, we have just two days.

1391
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:15,906
Come on.

1392
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:22,414
Children, this is our Solar Sysem.

1393
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:24,972
What is it called?
- Solar System.

1394
01:47:25,271 --> 01:47:25,908
Very good.

1395
01:47:25,972 --> 01:47:28,953
In the centre we have the Sun.

1396
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:33,752
And the first planet...
is called Mercury, which is..

1397
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,226
Different names in
Physics and Chemistry.

1398
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:38,694
Physics and Chemistry?

1399
01:47:38,785 --> 01:47:40,458
Who's this learned chap?

1400
01:47:40,553 --> 01:47:42,226
Me Shivkar Govind Talpade.

1401
01:47:42,322 --> 01:47:46,828
An old scholar of your class.
- So...it's you.

1402
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:49,435
So the plane flew?

1403
01:47:49,462 --> 01:47:52,272
Class 4...8 times fail.

1404
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:55,939
He'll fly an airplane...
build a flying ship.

1405
01:47:56,336 --> 01:47:58,475
Young man, if you're that smart.

1406
01:47:58,505 --> 01:48:01,008
...then why don't you
explain this to the kids?

1407
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:06,419
Come.

1408
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,554
Here.

1409
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:10,423
Mercury.

1410
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:16,396
'Buddh' in Physics and,
in Chemistry. - Uncle.

1411
01:48:16,489 --> 01:48:19,868
You see 4121 everywhere.

1412
01:48:19,926 --> 01:48:23,567
Naru...this isn't 4121 it's..

1413
01:48:28,668 --> 01:48:32,013
Oh yes, Para (Mercury)
in hindi looks like 4121 .

1414
01:48:32,038 --> 01:48:33,984
We just needed to add on top line.

1415
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:36,214
We found the fuel.

1416
01:48:36,309 --> 01:48:38,721
Kaka, it shines..
- But it's not silver.

1417
01:48:38,811 --> 01:48:40,484
It flows.. - But not water.

1418
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,890
The mixture of metal
and chemical, mercury.

1419
01:48:42,982 --> 01:48:45,690
Will our airplane fly now?
- Of course.

1420
01:48:45,718 --> 01:48:48,494
No it won't.
Don't move.

1421
01:48:49,455 --> 01:48:51,765
But why?
- You're under arrest.

1422
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,463
Kaka..

1423
01:49:23,289 --> 01:49:25,462
Don't worry...the airplane will fly.

1424
01:49:25,558 --> 01:49:27,560
You will find mercury
in the thermometer.

1425
01:49:27,594 --> 01:49:29,505
Thermometer.

1426
01:49:59,425 --> 01:50:01,530
I heard, but I couldn't believe it.

1427
01:50:01,594 --> 01:50:02,698
What?

1428
01:50:03,496 --> 01:50:05,442
That someone flew an airplane.

1429
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:07,375
...or that your useless
son flew an airplane.

1430
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:12,474
Although it's late,
but I still came to congratulate you.

1431
01:50:14,807 --> 01:50:16,980
Govind Shambhu Talpade.

1432
01:50:17,377 --> 01:50:20,517
Do you know why I made it this far?

1433
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:22,255
Because of you.

1434
01:50:22,915 --> 01:50:24,917
For I am like you.

1435
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:27,624
Headstrong!

1436
01:50:39,999 --> 01:50:44,311
Would you like to say
something in your defense?

1437
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:46,372
Your Honor, there's just one thing..

1438
01:50:46,472 --> 01:50:49,316
...I want to say to your Britishers.

1439
01:50:50,376 --> 01:50:51,582
Thank you.

1440
01:50:51,944 --> 01:50:54,322
Thank you for arresting me.

1441
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:56,858
Thank you for bringing me here.

1442
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:59,052
And thank you for filing
this case against me.

1443
01:50:59,318 --> 01:51:00,490
Because if you hadn't done this..

1444
01:51:00,586 --> 01:51:02,566
...I wouldn't have
reached out to my people.

1445
01:51:03,556 --> 01:51:06,867
Thank you...for bringing me close...

1446
01:51:08,461 --> 01:51:09,633
...to my people.

1447
01:51:10,396 --> 01:51:13,377
Flying an airplane
seemed like a fairytale.

1448
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:15,003
I had lost all hope.

1449
01:51:15,501 --> 01:51:18,311
But today,
after seeing all these people..

1450
01:51:18,337 --> 01:51:20,408
...I've made up my mind.

1451
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,851
Humans will fly.

1452
01:51:23,476 --> 01:51:29,950
So thank you...for mending
my broken courage.

1453
01:51:30,616 --> 01:51:34,655
Friends, there's just
one thing I want to say to you.

1454
01:51:34,987 --> 01:51:36,728
These Britishers
can steal our slumber..

1455
01:51:36,823 --> 01:51:39,599
...but not our dreams.

1456
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:42,736
When I fly my airplane, and..

1457
01:51:43,529 --> 01:51:49,480
“You will hear just one
voice in the engine's rattle.

1458
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:53,547
Vande Mataram!

1459
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:03,884
Sir...l am no freedom fighter.

1460
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:09,661
But...for giving me the opportunity.

1461
01:52:09,922 --> 01:52:14,393
...to say Vande Mataram
in front of all my people..

1462
01:52:14,427 --> 01:52:15,565
Thank you!

1463
01:52:15,628 --> 01:52:17,403
Vande Mataram!

1464
01:52:17,497 --> 01:52:19,704
Vande Mataram!

1465
01:52:50,429 --> 01:52:56,778
Friend...our paths maybe separate,
but our destination is the same.

1466
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:58,415
Freedom.

1467
01:52:58,571 --> 01:53:01,313
Tomorrow, everyone will hear
just one voice in engine's rattle.

1468
01:53:01,674 --> 01:53:03,813
“Ne-re free.'

1469
01:53:04,877 --> 01:53:06,379
Vande Mataram!

1470
01:53:30,903 --> 01:53:34,942
Tonight's the last night,
tomorrow the final goodbye.

1471
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:36,979
Without me?

1472
01:53:37,243 --> 01:53:38,722
It's suicide.

1473
01:53:38,911 --> 01:53:41,721
I don't know how to stop,
turn or land.

1474
01:53:42,281 --> 01:53:44,625
It's an unsolvable maze.

1475
01:53:44,684 --> 01:53:46,357
So why don't you just jump down?

1476
01:53:46,385 --> 01:53:47,830
Death in any case.

1477
01:53:50,256 --> 01:53:53,396
I am already burdened
for murdering Mr. Shastnj.

1478
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:54,631
Don't want to be
responsible for yours.

1479
01:53:54,694 --> 01:53:56,264
You fulfilled my
third condition.

1480
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:58,638
...and now you don't
want your reward?

1481
01:53:59,332 --> 01:54:01,744
I know you want me to come with you.

1482
01:54:01,834 --> 01:54:04,781
No, I don't want you to come.

1483
01:54:04,871 --> 01:54:07,408
You want it.
- No.

1484
01:54:07,807 --> 01:54:12,347
If you didn't...then why
would you put two chairs in it?

1485
01:54:12,812 --> 01:54:17,420
Because...l..
- Yes..

1486
01:54:20,353 --> 01:54:21,991
Speak up.

1487
01:54:23,689 --> 01:54:25,362
No reason!

1488
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:33,772
Kaka...say cheese!

1489
01:54:39,906 --> 01:54:41,408
Hey our Newton.

1490
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:42,850
Will that Chatterjee
from the police station..

1491
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:44,650
...come down to click our picture?

1492
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:47,658
It's automatic, uncle.
- How?

1493
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:54,261
Well, I've put in a small
piece of cotton in the camera.

1494
01:54:54,287 --> 01:54:56,267
And poured two drops of water.

1495
01:54:56,322 --> 01:54:58,268
As soon as the cotton gets wet,
it will go heavier..

1496
01:54:58,324 --> 01:54:59,701
...the button will get
pressed automatically.

1497
01:54:59,792 --> 01:55:01,772
And take our picture.

1498
01:55:01,794 --> 01:55:03,398
Look ahead.

1499
01:55:05,831 --> 01:55:08,835
Kaka, what's inside?
- Letters, for my mother.

1500
01:55:08,901 --> 01:55:12,348
Tomorrow,
at 9:24 am your Kaka will fly away.

1501
01:55:12,371 --> 01:55:13,349
Don't stay asleep.

1502
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:15,909
Narayan...your father's
furious, hurry up.

1503
01:55:15,975 --> 01:55:18,819
Mother, I'll be there, you go.
- Come on.

1504
01:55:18,878 --> 01:55:20,687
Sister-in-law.

1505
01:55:27,353 --> 01:55:29,492
Are you really going tomorrow?

1506
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:34,369
You will never come back?

1507
01:55:37,229 --> 01:55:38,799
Good for you.

1508
01:55:39,465 --> 01:55:41,809
At least you will be free.

1509
01:55:42,301 --> 01:55:43,974
Don't worn] about Narayan.

1510
01:55:44,303 --> 01:55:46,283
I'll appoint a tutor for him.

1511
01:55:47,873 --> 01:55:51,821
I'll take care of mother, father...

1512
01:55:52,812 --> 01:55:54,519
You just go.

1513
01:55:56,882 --> 01:55:58,589
Choose one.

1514
01:56:00,353 --> 01:56:01,661
Come on choose.

1515
01:56:04,690 --> 01:56:06,294
Stupid!

1516
01:56:06,759 --> 01:56:08,432
You lost again.

1517
01:56:10,429 --> 01:56:12,602
Don't lose tomorrow, Shivy.

1518
01:56:13,766 --> 01:56:15,939
Don't lose tomorrow, Shivy.

1519
01:56:16,535 --> 01:56:18,276
Don't lose tomorrow.

1520
01:56:20,873 --> 01:56:23,444
Make India proud!

1521
01:56:37,656 --> 01:56:41,934
'I will wear this the
day...l take off in an airplane.'

1522
01:56:43,729 --> 01:56:50,544
"With a bag full of memories..."

1523
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:56,780
"And a trunk stuffed with love..."

1524
01:56:57,576 --> 01:57:04,551
"Turned the key,
seatbelts fastened..."

1525
01:57:04,583 --> 01:57:11,467
"Turned the key,
seatbelts fastened..."

1526
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:17,736
"Time to go kiss the moon."

1527
01:57:17,763 --> 01:57:22,763
"The swan will fly away alone.."

1528
01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:36,477
"The swan will fly away alone.."

1529
01:58:08,247 --> 01:58:09,590
Go.

1530
01:58:13,452 --> 01:58:15,932
Go quietly.

1531
01:58:25,664 --> 01:58:27,610
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

1532
01:58:27,633 --> 01:58:30,739
I told you not to.
- But, father..

1533
01:58:30,936 --> 01:58:33,780
You won't listen, will you?

1534
01:58:34,273 --> 01:58:35,809
You won't listen...

1535
01:58:38,711 --> 01:58:40,884
Dawn comes everyday. .

1536
01:58:41,547 --> 01:58:43,618
...but airplanes don't fly even] day.

1537
01:58:44,617 --> 01:58:47,427
You will definitely go watch
the airplane fly today, Narayan.

1538
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,555
Go.

1539
01:58:50,656 --> 01:58:52,294
Let go!

1540
01:59:00,699 --> 01:59:02,906
We shall salute you rather.

1541
01:59:02,968 --> 01:59:08,441
My dear friend, before you
become the world's first flying man.

1542
01:59:08,541 --> 01:59:13,286
Won't you give me an autograph?

1543
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:18,891
Memorabilia!

1544
01:59:22,521 --> 01:59:23,932
Sir. Sir!

1545
01:59:23,989 --> 01:59:25,866
Shiv's escaped.
He's escaped from jail.

1546
01:59:25,891 --> 01:59:27,495
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1547
01:59:27,593 --> 01:59:29,800
He's escaped, sir. He's escaped.

1548
01:59:40,339 --> 01:59:44,310
It will end the way...it all started.

1549
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:47,917
In the middle of the clouds.

1550
01:59:49,949 --> 01:59:53,556
Hold me tight, don't be shy.

1551
01:59:54,753 --> 01:59:57,393
Do you remember your lines?

1552
01:59:57,423 --> 01:59:59,596
I am love with you, Shakuntala.

1553
01:59:59,658 --> 02:00:01,365
Let's go far away.
