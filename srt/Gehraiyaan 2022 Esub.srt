So, what grave tragedy struck you

199
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,230
that you went from writing ads to a novel?

200
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,140

Tia mentioned that you guys
are meeting after a really long time.

205
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,310
Yeah. It's been years
since she moved to the US...

206
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,980
And I guess I'm not
good at staying in touch.

207

When did you meet Tia?

208
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,850
- Almost 3 years ago.
- Okay.

209
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,850
Her dad was in real estate.

210

- And I was assisting him.
- Nice.

But the three of you
grew up together, right?

217
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,810
Yeah but the two of them were
studying together in the US.

218
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,180
And I was here so...

219
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,680

through my boyfriend.

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,890
Great.

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,350
I thought I was the
only outsider here.

222
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,930
I guess that makes the two of us.

would get us out of this pool?

study in the US with the two of you?

Umm...It was too expensive I guess.

the family business together.

But then her dad left
and started a cheese farm.

02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:48,540
I made things worse.

2312
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,040
I'm sorry.

2313
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:53,580
Don't say sorry, please.

2314
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:56,830
Dad would have probably never told me.

2315
02:11:58,830 --> 02:12:00,460
And it scares me to think that...

2316
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:03,790
I wouldn't have ever gotten
a chance to fix things with him.

2317
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:08,880
And what about us, Al?

2318
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:13,130
Can't we put the past behind us?

2319
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:18,830
It's just that I feel
like we're stuck in a loop, Al.

2320
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:22,630
I'm stuck, I'm stuck. I can't breathe Ma!

2321
02:12:22,710 --> 02:12:23,750
Voila!

2322
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:25,380
Just like our parents.

2324
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:33,170
Can't we break out of it?

2325
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:38,710
I know it's not easy.

2326
02:12:41,460 --> 02:12:43,080
But can we start again?

2327
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:48,170
It's not easy.

2328
02:12:48,820 --> 02:12:50,290
But it's still a choice.

2329
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:55,000
But only if you want it.

2330
02:12:56,750 --> 02:12:58,830
But maybe if we let go of the past,

2331
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:01,250
it'll let go of us too?

2333
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:11,460
I want to.

2334
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:14,420
You guys look like you're
having a pretty serious conversation!

2335

Anika's vegetarian grand mother

2336
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:18,460
just gobbled up some pork belly bao,
thinking it was Paneer!

2337
02:13:19,710 --> 02:13:20,590
Don't laugh!

2338
02:13:20,670 --> 02:13:23,170
Karan, what's in this bao?

2339
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:24,790
Let me check with the caterer.

2340
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:32,330
We have met somewhere before!

2341
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:34,130
Alisha!

2342
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,080
Right?
