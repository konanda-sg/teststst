1
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,041
And this is very crucial for both the countries.

2
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:33,541
This year onwards, we'll not just be exporting Sapotas, but Mangoes as well.

3
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,666
We're sending some fruit samples on behalf of India...

4
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,250
...with the Pakistani delegates as a gesture.

5
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,041
The ex-Governor of Lahore, Mr. Javed Ahmed is amongst us.

6
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:48,041
I would request him to say a few words.

7
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,041
Thank you. Thank you very much.

8
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,416
This isn't just an Agro-Trade Conference for me.

9
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,875
It is also an important occasion.

10
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:05,833
This is my son and the future leader of Pakistan...

11
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,958
...Bilal Ahmed's first international conference.

12
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,083
With permission from our respected Conference Head...

13
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,333
...I would like Bilal Ahmed to conclude this conference.

14
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:21,875
Ladies and Gentlemen, Bilal Ahmed!

15
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,875
Where is he?

16
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,000
Bilal Ahmed... he'll be here in a second...

17
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Bilal!

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,875
Bilal!

19
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,250
This is too much!

20
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,750
You're supposed to be the next Jinnah...

21
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,083
...and you're here peeing.

22
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,291
Are you sure he's inside? - Yes.

23
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,291
Then open the door.

24
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,541
Sukhi, get the new ball.

25
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,250
We've already lost two.

26
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,625
I told you don't let some random stranger play.

27
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,958
If we lose this one too...

28
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,833
...then no one gets to bat. - Of course not.

29
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,625
Because I am going to knock this ball...

30
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,708
...out of Lahore's Gaddafi stadium too.

31
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,666
Lahore?

32
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,416
Brother ... - Yes?

33
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,416
Are you a Pakistani? - Yes Sir!

34
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,750
Brother, you could've told me before that you're a Pakistani.

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,750
I wasted two balls for no reason.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,208
Our brother's fianc Happy, is just stunning.

37
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,583
You know, like rose syrup mixed in sweet buttermilk.

38
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,333
I've heard that Happy was also Ms. Amritsar?

39
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,958
She could've been Ms. India bro...

40
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,958
...but our brother convinced her father at the right time.

41
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,000
Long live brother Bagga.

42
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,625
Hello, boss!

43
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,166
Hello father-in-law!

44
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,291
Oh, hello son

45
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,375
Come come... God bless you!

46
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,375
Amazing.

47
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,833
Long live brother Bagga.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,625
Is that even an explanation Bilal?

49
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,208
I brought you here to introduce you to everyone...

50
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,291
...and you slipped out again?

51
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,875
Why did you come all the way from Lahore to Amritsar?

52
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,916
To play?

53
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,583
Look Bilal, you're supposed to be the next Jinnah.

54
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,000
And I want no more mistakes.

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:00,833
What?

56
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,416
No more mistakes.

57
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,416
Good. Come.

58
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,416
This is going to be fun, they'll be coming from that side.

59
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,416
Come on, come on.

60
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,541
Hello? Excuse me!

61
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,125
What...what do you want?

62
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,541
Nothing.

63
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,833
I just came to deliver the flowers. - Then deliver them.

64
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:24,416
I already did.

65
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,041
Then should I lay out dinner for you now?

66
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,333
Or you'll have desert? - No, it's okay.

67
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,250
Then get going.

68
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,166
God knows they come from?

69
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,250
On the occasion of our brother's wedding...

70
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,833
...Mr...Mr. Daman Singh Bagga will be performing on stage.

71
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,833
Let's give him a big round of applause.

72
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,625
Play the song properly.

73
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,541
It's your brother's wedding.

74
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,541
My brother's wedding?

75
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,958
"O Sweetheart..."

76
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,041
"I wonder what's going to be..."

77
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:16,125
"...the fate of us meeting."

78
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,500
"My heart cannot live"

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,250
"...a moment without you."

80
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,208
"Your style... your eyes... and your smile."

81
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,958
"Your charm... My heart's crazy about you."

82
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,375
"There's color...there's beauty."

83
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,875
"And the procession of my dreams."

84
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,208
"There is nothing more I want."

85
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,208
"Heaven is with me."

86
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:49,875
Happy! You had to go now only? - Why? Does it inform you before?

87
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,708
Please hurry up.

88
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,583
Can I pee now?

89
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,541
"O Sweetheart..."

90
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,958
"I wonder what's going to be..."

91
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:03,791
"...the fate of us meeting."

92
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,041
"My heart cannot live..."

93
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,000
"...a moment without you."

94
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,041
Hello, Guddu? - Hello Happy!

95
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,625
It's the flower truck, right?

96
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:13,916
Okay, okay hang up.

97
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,916
Love you.

98
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,750
Happy! Happy?

99
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,291
Oh Guddu.

100
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,166
Where have you reached? - What do you mean reached?

101
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,791
I'll reach if I leave!

102
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,125
Then Why haven't you left? - So I'll leave?

103
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,583
Idiot, Happy's already jumped out of the window.

104
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,750
Where? - In the river you fool.

105
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,875
You went there with your flower truck, didn't you?

106
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,666
Okay hold on, stay on the line, let me check.

107
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:15,916
What do you mean by check?

108
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,375
Sister-in-law.

109
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,666
Sister-in-law Happy.

110
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,083
Sister-in-law. - What are you doing?

111
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,666
Winkle! Winkle! - Wasting my time.

112
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,541
You think Happy will get lost in my truck?

113
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,625
She's neither in the Truck, nor at the window.

114
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,625
Then where did Happy go?

115
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,666
Boss, it's confirmed. She ran away!

116
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,000
You see Mr. father-in-law!

117
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,625
..I gave a solo performance on stage.

118
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
Called a choreographer all the way from Mumbai.

119
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,208
Paid him 140,000 Rupees.

120
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,083
This bloody orchestra...

121
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,916
He could've come in a bus.

122
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:25,833
But I paid for his AC two-tier ticket...

123
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,708
I stocked your bar with scotch.

124
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:35,208
Being a corporator, I have spent like a minister!

125
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,250
And what happened?

126
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,083
What happened?

127
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,083
Sister-in-law ran away. - Ran away.

128
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,666
The wedding cards were distributed!

129
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,958
Guddu!

130
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,541
Listen to me, Guddu.

131
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,416
Maybe she got scared at the last moment and didn't jump.

132
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,833
Maybe she is coming an other way.

133
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,250
And... - And what?

134
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,750
Maybe Bagga's opposition party kidnapped sister-in-law.

135
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:03,750
He's the Corporator of the city.

136
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,375
Hold this.

137
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,166
Only a fool will kidnap his bride.

138
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,333
But that is what you were doing.

139
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,041
I love Happy, understand?

140
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,708
Very nice - Now?

141
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,125
Now what? Get on the bike.

142
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,791
Where to?

143
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,375
We'll find Happy.

144
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,250
But Guddu my truck is parked here. - What's going to happen to your truck?

145
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,916
Come back for it later.

146
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,916
Papa will kill me

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,291
Brother, there's no one inside.

148
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:47,291
What are you looking at? Destroy everything.

149
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,500
Father...this is the same truck that was parked outside our house.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,500
The driver was there too.

151
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,958
It's a diplomatic convoy Sir, We have free passage.

152
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,125
There's no checking, let me see

153
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,250
The truck belongs to us. Indian.

154
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,250
We're simply delivering gifts to Lahore.

155
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,750
We'll return tonight itself.

156
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,583
Please have a look...

157
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,416
We got the radio message for 15 minutes ago.

158
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:40,666
What kept you?

159
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,416
There was a wedding happening on the way.

160
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,916
...and they stopped our truck for no reason.

161
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:44,833
Fine, fine...come...

162
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,833
Come on, Yeshwant.

163
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,625
Greetings. - Greetings.

164
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,000
Look Son.

165
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,875
This is the response we got from a single trade delegation.

166
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,416
And this is just the beginning.

167
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,375
And you...wanted to be a cricketer.

168
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,166
If you follow my guidance, then I am sure...

169
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:30,750
...one day you will change the history of Pakistan.

170
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,958
Ishtiyaq Sir is coming from Islamabad tomorrow. - Yes.

171
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,875
I want you to meet him. - Yes, father.

172
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,000
Proud of you.

173
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,000
...and fruits are good for you!

174
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,833
Lets have some real breakfast!

175
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,791
This is what you call breakfast!

176
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,625
Mr. Junior. Please be careful.

177
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:53,875
It will increase your cholesterol.

178
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,583
Let something increase uncle.

179
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,291
My whole life father has never let anything but my height increase!

180
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,291
Please stop dotting him while he eats.

181
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,375
Aunty, your niece Huriya...

182
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,250
Did she finalize a design for her necklace?

183
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,791
Would have if it was a Pakistani design.

184
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,416
She saw some Indian actress wearing it

185
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:13,875
What's her name?

186
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,291
She's quite popular.

187
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,416
Kareena Kaif.

188
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,250
Try to understand,

189
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,833
If it's Kareena she must be Kapoor.

190
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,416
Kaif is Katrina.

191
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,125
Are they your nieces?

192
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,125
You keep moving away from the topic.

193
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,250
The crate is moving. - It's a basket.

194
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,791
What's the difference between a crate and basket?

195
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,791
The same that is between Kareena and Katrina.

196
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,375
Who are you? - Who are you?

197
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,208
I am Happy. - Who Happy?

198
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,708
Happy... Advocate Majid's niece? - No, she passed away. - I see.

199
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,416
No need to blabber. Go call Guddu. - Guddu?

200
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,375
Who's Guddu?

201
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,333
Guddu... Our gardener's grandson Guddu.

202
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,208
No-no, he's in jail. - Okay.

203
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,916
Don't act smart! I'm trying to show some respect because you're old!

204
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,958
Go and call Guddu. - Again with Guddu.

205
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,041
What a stubborn girl!

206
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:27,958
Who the hell is she?

207
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,875
I said I am Happy. - So what do you want?

208
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,750
I already said I want Guddu. Where is he?

209
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,250
He must be at his home, there is no Guddu here.

210
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,541
Control your attitude and talk respectfully.

211
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,666
What were you doing inside that?

212
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,000
I am not interested in talking to you.

213
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
I wonder what zoo you've brought me to.

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,708
Where's that bloody Winkle?

215
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,583
Wink... No, there's no Winkle.

216
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,208
Who is this bloody Winkle now?

217
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,833
First Guddu, now Winkle

218
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:50,916
Are you crazy?

219
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,791
Oh really?...so you don't know Winkle either.

220
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,791
So who do you all work for?

221
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:56,833
Who is your boss?

222
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,041
Look, girl. If you say anything disrespectful for Mr. Senior...

223
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,708
...then the consequences will be dire!

224
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,041
Mr. Senior.

225
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,333
Do-do you guys work for Bagga?

226
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,208
Bagga! What Bagga?

227
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,375
This is my...

228
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,875
This is my father Javed Ahmed's house.

229
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,833
This is the ex-Governor's home, idiot.

230
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,875
Now shut your mouth and get out,

231
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,583
I'm leaving, I'm leaving... Stupid fellow!

232
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,041
Uncle, please get her out.

233
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,375
Otherwise I will blow my cool.

234
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,125
Come on. Come on. - God knows what madhouse of Lahore she's escaped from!

235
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,625
I haven't escaped from one, I've come to one!

236
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,666
Come on. - *Mocks* God knows what madhouse of Lahore...

237
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,708
Lahore...

238
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,166
Lahore?

239
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,750
Is she saying 'Lahol' or 'Lahore'?

240
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,208
Is...is this Lahore?

241
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,791
What do you mean by Lahore?

242
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:43,750
I...

243
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,916
I jumped in Winkle's truck...

244
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:47,916
How?

245
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,166
And that too Lahore?

246
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:56,750
Are you an Indian? - Is-Is this Pakistan?

247
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,666
Curses.

248
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,333
You came all the way from Amritsar to Lahore..

249
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,833
..India to Pakistan, in a bride's outfit...

250
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,083
Without a passport, or a visa...

251
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,666
...and to Javed Ahmed's house.

252
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,000
Do you have any idea what you've done?

253
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,708
What have I done? - You...

254
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:13,750
Sh**!

255
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,041
If we don't get her deported right now...

256
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,541
...our lives will be ruined.

257
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,000
Just Give me your mobile once... - Leave me!

258
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,125
What are you doing?

259
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,000
If I get deported they will hand me over to father.

260
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,208
And he'll get me married to Bagga...

261
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,791
I don't want to get deported!

262
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,333
You don't want to?

263
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,416
How does it matter what you want?

264
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,125
Madam, this is Pakistan.

265
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,916
If my father finds out about this...

266
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,875
...then he'll turn this house into a graveyard for me...

267
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,791
...this healthy woman and this helpless man.

268
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,000
You will go back to India right now.

269
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,416
Look, give me your mobile.

270
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,125
I want to talk to Guddu. - What...

271
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,708
You uncivilized...

272
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,166
Stop trying to snatch my mobile. - Phone.

273
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:52,208
Auntie, just control her please.

274
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:52,958
Come here...

275
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,416
Go and lock her in the room! - Leave me!

276
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,958
Sir, look it's the same Kareena Kaif design.

277
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,208
Oh just take her away, auntie. - Okay.

278
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,958
Come on. - Mr. Junior...

279
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,666
if Mr. Senior gets a whiff of this...

280
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,000
...then we'll be in big trouble.

281
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,041
Thank you very much for your advice, uncle.

282
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,208
I'll be really grateful if you shut that woman up.

283
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:17,208
Will you shut up?

284
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,250
Mr. Junior!

285
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,666
Lady! Get back here

286
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,958
Hey...Indian!

287
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,250
Stop!

288
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,125
You couldn't control one girl...

289
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,250
What's the point of all this physique?

290
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,708
But I just... - Your obsession for the necklace will be the end of you.

291
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,375
Let's go. - I didn't ask for it right now.

292
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,791
She's roaming the streets of Lahore...

293
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,791
...and she knows the names of Mr. Junior and Senior both.

294
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,791
You never apologise for your mistakes

295
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,083
Please be quiet. - Yes, father.

296
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,833
Zoya is your fiance. - Yes. Yes, father.

297
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,375
Then why aren't you attending her calls?

298
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,416
She's Zia Rehmani's daughter.

299
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,625
Do you know this marriage will change the history of Pakistan?

300
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,625
Call her immediately. - Yes. Yes, father.

301
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,166
There's no sign of Happy

302
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,833
Come Winkle, let's go and tell Happy's father everything.

303
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,208
What? Tell him what?

304
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,166
"Hello father...we tried to run off with your daughter..."

305
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,666
"...but we failed."

306
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,583
Everyone's thirsty for our blood out there.

307
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,750
And you're making plans of getting killed?

308
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,541
Even if I get killed today, father must know the truth.

309
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,250
Happy could be in some kind of trouble.

310
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,250
Go on.

311
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,875
Someone will have to arrange for your final rites after you're dead,

312
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,875
I will make those arrangements. I swear.

313
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,416
Stop-stop-stop. - But you asked me to take you to the market.

314
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,958
Come on, stop.

315
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,708
How much? - I'm going to charge you the entire fare.

316
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,291
30 rupees. - Here.

317
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,291
Gandhiji...in Lahore. - Adjust for now.

318
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:10,833
Pay me with Pakistani notes, and let me go.

319
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,916
Take this...and give me some Pakistani notes.

320
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,416
What will I do with this fake bracelet?

321
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:15,666
I want my 30 rupees.

322
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,708
I am giving you gold practically free...and you're showing attitude.

323
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,833
Are you giving? Or should I make a scene?

324
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,958
Give me my fare. - Fine, don't give me any notes.

325
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,208
Get lost. - Not so easily.

326
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,250
I am already in a bad mood.

327
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,875
Don't mess with me - I'm going to leave with my fare.

328
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,416
Everyone is getting on my nerves since this morning.

329
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:31,916
Move aside or else I will slap you.

330
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,708
Hand me my money quietly

331
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:35,291
What's the problem?

332
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,625
Sir, she isn't paying the rickshaw fare...

333
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,500
...and asking me for money instead.

334
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,416
Hold on...show me those notes.

335
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,583
Ahh Mahatma Gandhi!

336
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,541
I wish Mahatma Gandhi was in Pakistan!

337
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,958
This isn't mine, it belongs to him. - She's such a liar!

338
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,750
Wait a minute...these Indians think we Pakistanis are stupid.

339
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,958
You've been sent here by some new technique of spying, right.

340
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,708
Sir, I am Pakistani. I live close-by. Really close-by.

341
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,750
Where? - In the lanes of Ballimara.

342
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,541
Balli...

343
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:13,833
Ballimara?

344
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,333
Sounds familiar.

345
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,375
Exactly...it's in Lahore.

346
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,875
Aah hah...it's not in Lahore. It's in Delhi.

347
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,916
It's Mirza Ghalib's neighborhood.

348
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,250
I wish Mirza Ghalib was in Pakistan as well.

349
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,958
Sir, we have Illama Iqbal. - Who?

350
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,875
Illama Iqbal. - Yes, of course.

351
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,916
You see, lady...you're giving me a great opportunity...

352
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,833
...to fulfill the biggest dream of my life.

353
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,166
My desire to catch an Indian spy is finally complete.

354
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,916
Alhumdulillah! -Alhumdulillah!

355
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,541
Amjad. - Sir.

356
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,291
Make the spy sit in the car. - Yes Sir.

357
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,291
Hey...

358
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,625
Usman Afridi...

359
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:54,791
Shahid Afridi's uncle huh?

360
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,541
Do you know who you are arresting?

361
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,500
I am the guest of Lahore's most respected family.

362
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,750
Javed Ahmed...ex-Governor.

363
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,791
Have you heard his name?

364
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,000
So...are you Mr. Senior's...

365
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,958
No, Junior. I am his son's guest.

366
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,583
The special kind.

367
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:15,958
Amjad. - Sir.

368
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:21,333
Please ask the spy to respectfully get in the jeep. - Sir.

369
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,833
Please come. Sit

370
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,958
Do you have a mobile phone?

371
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,416
Brother, should I get Kartar's boys too?

372
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:28,375
Brother, Guddu.

373
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,791
Guddu.

374
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:30,708
Catch him.

375
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,041
Where's sister-in-law Happy?

376
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,625
Where's Happy?

377
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,125
Where is she? We're asking you!

378
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,125
Get lost. You bloody....

379
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,416
Where is my Happy?

380
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,208
Father, I've been looking all over for her myself

381
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,166
How dare you lie you swine? You lying swine!

382
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,291
I swear on Happy, she is not with me.

383
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,291
Honestly, father.

384
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:11,000
So she isn't with you? - No.

385
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,083
Now...this is a new problem.

386
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,666
This is the highlight.

387
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,333
She was supposed to marry me...elope with him...

388
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,291
...but she fled with someone else.

389
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:23,208
Wow!

390
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:27,000
Your Happy's quite a character... - Bagga. Mind your language!

391
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,000
I should mind my language?

392
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,041
For Gods sake shut up. - I should shut up?

393
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,291
All the cards had been distributed.

394
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,041
You must give your word in everyone's presence...

395
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:40,041
...whenever you find Happy... you will get her married to me.

396
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,625
What?

397
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,791
Happy will marry me, Bagga.

398
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,000
And in front of you.

399
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,916
You fool, you'll see Happy when someone sees you.

400
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,333
Put a curfew on him.

401
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,750
Take his mobile!

402
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,125
Happy isn't going to be anyone's.

403
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:11,291
The day I find her, I will kill her!

404
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,666
Hey...Afridi!

405
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,333
You will deeply regret this.

406
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,416
If you don't give me a phone right now to make a call...

407
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,291
...I'll have Mr. Junior strip you of your uniform...

408
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,916
...and blow balloons at the children's park, or my name isn't Happy.

409
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,250
This is my last warning to you.

410
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,958
Let me make one call to India...

411
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:29,958
...or else I will have you thrown out of Lahore!

412
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,958
You have no idea how much Mr. Junior respects me.

413
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,166
He practically dances to my tunes.

414
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll give you one more chance to obey!

415
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,125
Otherwise I'll get you transferred to Kabul.

416
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,666
Amidst all the Talibanis!

417
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,666
And you...

418
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,333
Come.

419
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,666
Look, just let me... - Come on.

420
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,000
Make her sit in the car.

421
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,416
And take some more people with you, she runs away.

422
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,625
Leave me.

423
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:00,583
Curses

424
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,333
Mr. Junior.

425
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,000
What is this Indian bud that you're..

426
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,291
..trying to grow on Lahore's soil?

427
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,125
Afridi, she is a mistake!

428
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,208
And she can ruin father's reputation.

429
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:14,208
If this leaks out, then we'll be humiliated Internationally!

430
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,000
First you ran away from your home...

431
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,375
...then you ran away from my home.

432
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,250
Do you even think before doing anything? - No.

433
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,166
I want a phone.

434
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,916
Are you not even a little tensed that you are in Pakistan?

435
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:56,125
Pakistan should be tensed, not me!

436
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,291
You've a screw loose, you know that?

437
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,583
Anyways, you'll be sent to India right now.

438
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,375
Bull sh** you cannot send me back.

439
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,041
I am sending you back.

440
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,375
The deportation guys will come and take you with them...

441
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,625
Don't even think about it.

442
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:10,625
I know...how well reputed your family is.

443
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,791
And how helpless it can be because of me.

444
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:18,041
I'll tell the media... that Javed Ahmed and Bilal Ahmed...

445
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,375
...brings girls here from India without passport or visa.

446
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:25,166
And they make them... do God knows what.

447
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,625
I want to send you back home respectfully...

448
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,250
...and you're threatening to ruin my reputation.

449
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,375
Yes.

450
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:37,375
I can't believe my ears.

451
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,958
I can't believe my eyes!

452
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,125
Quietly handover your phone.

453
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:49,125
Hand it over or... - Just shut up, okay.

454
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,208
Was that Bilal's car?

455
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,250
What are you doing?

456
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,416
Follow him.

457
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,041
Wagah?

458
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:02,500
I won't go to Amritsar. Stop the car.

459
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,791
This won't car stop now.

460
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,833
Stop the car. Have you lost your mind?

461
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,000
Do you know whose car is that? - Whose?

462
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,041
Zoya's. - So?

463
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,875
She's my fiance.

464
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,000
A grown man afraid of his fianc?

465
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,708
Stop the car and I'll talk to her.

466
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,000
You'll talk to her? Who are you?

467
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,875
Happy!

468
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,166
Oh...no!

469
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,166
Damn it!

470
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,375
Come out, Bilal. - Zo...

471
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:39,375
First come out.

472
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:50,416
Why did you run after seeing me?

473
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,208
And who is she?

474
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,541
She...

475
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,000
She is Happy. - I can see that she is.

476
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,583
But I am asking you her name.

477
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:58,916
Her name is Happy.

478
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:02,208
And what is Happy doing in the front seat of your car?

479
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,708
What is she doing...

480
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:10,000
Hey you...who are you?

481
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,250
What do you want?

482
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,250
Why are you wearing that wedding dress?

483
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,500
Should I have worn a night dress for my wedding?

484
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,166
What?

485
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,833
Bilal...what is she saying?

486
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,750
What are you saying?

487
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,416
Actually she is right.

488
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,375
Hold on...let me explain to you.

489
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,583
Just give me a minute, okay.

490
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:28,916
How dare you? What is this..

491
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,791
Get in the car, I'll explain everything.

492
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:35,791
Please.

493
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,625
That front seat's mine.

494
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,166
Get out and sit on the backseat.

495
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,833
Now!

496
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,666
You're marrying her?

497
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:48,333
Take my advice...

498
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,583
...and tie a big stone around your neck and jump in the river.

499
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:57,083
Everything you told me is a lie.

500
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,875
I don't believe this nonsense.

501
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,541
And Guddu!

502
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,916
It must be one of your nicknames.

503
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,000
You've known me since I was a kid...

504
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,708
...when did I ever have a nickname like Guddu?

505
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:07,583
She is Happy.

506
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:08,791
Guddu's Happy.

507
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,875
Say something... why are you quiet now? Huh?

508
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,041
I am stuck amongst a bunch of idiots!

509
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:15,708
I've been asking for a phone call since morning.

510
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,625
I would've spoken to Guddu by now.

511
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,250
Correct.

512
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,541
I am such a fool

513
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,208
Here...call your Guddu...

514
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,416
...and let her speak to him as well.

515
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,125
Hold on, I am going to ask his name.

516
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:30,125
Give that to me.

517
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:37,208
Brother, 'Private Number' flashing on Guddu's cellphone?

518
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,291
Hello. - Am I speaking with Guddu?

519
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,250
There's no Guddu here.

520
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,833
Who is that?

521
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,208
Don't you know English?

522
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,916
Me Daman Singh Bagga... Punjabi to English non-stop top speed.

523
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:51,083
Who you be? What you want?

524
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,583
Are you demented? You're Guddu, right?

525
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,375
I already told you this is Bagga speaking,

526
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,875
Who you be? - Angelina Jolie.

527
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,000
Curse you...

528
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,708
Hang up!

529
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:02,583
Stupid idiot!

530
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:03,750
There is no Guddu!

531
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,250
Who was it, brother? - Some Jolly.

532
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,291
Trying to flaunt her English.

533
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,625
Did you hear your brother's English?

534
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:10,416
There's no Guddu?

535
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,291
There's no bloody Guddu.

536
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,541
There's no bloody Guddu.

537
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:16,625
Here he is!

538
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,875
It's either Happy or Jolly...

539
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,416
Wonder who else Guddu's been going around with?

540
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:23,916
It's all because of his music.

541
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:27,125
If you could play the guitar or something... - Then what?

542
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,375
Should I quit politics?

543
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,000
And become a musician? - Hold on! Hold on!

544
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,625
Who was on the phone? - Some Bagga.

545
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,791
Bagga's the guy my father wanted me to marry.

546
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,708
Now there's a Bagga in the story too.

547
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,000
No-no-no-no...there's a Bagga.

548
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,041
There's a Bagga since morning.

549
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,500
Good afternoon.

550
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,750
Hello, dad. - Hello, dear.

551
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:48,916
Who is this?

552
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:52,958
She's Happy. - Happy? Who?

553
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,083
Bilal...tell him.

554
00:29:56,583 --> 00:30:00,416
Uncle she's...my Happy cousin...

555
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,625
I mean my cousin Happy.

556
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,666
Javed never mentioned anything about her.

557
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:08,333
Happy dear...where do you live? - K-K-Karachi.

558
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,625
She is from Karachi.

559
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:15,250
To attend a wedding. - Very nice, Karachi.

560
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,250
So dear what's happening in Karachi these days?

561
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,916
She's a very homely kid, uncle...

562
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,958
...she wouldn't know what's happening in...Karachi.

563
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:28,500
Bilal...you're answering all the questions.

564
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,833
Let me here this cute girl's voice as well.

565
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:32,875
She won't speak.

566
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,958
She-she-she won't speak.

567
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,083
Why?

568
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:43,708
How can she speak? - She can't speak?

569
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,833
I am sorry, is she...

570
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:48,666
Just a minute...excuse me.

571
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:52,375
Dear, look after Happy. Okay.

572
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:53,875
Yes. Tell me.

573
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,833
You've started lying so flawlessly.

574
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,208
Tell me honestly, what's going on between you two?

575
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,958
Why do you come back to that?

576
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,791
Where else should I go?

577
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:04,541
Come here.

578
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,791
Think about solving this problem. - Am I a problem?

579
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,416
Oh just...will you please shut up?

580
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:11,333
Just shut up alright!

581
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:15,250
My life is ruined ever since you popped out of that basket!

582
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,708
Zoya, even if I try to deport her... she'll blabber nonsense to the media.

583
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,166
So just help me.

584
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:23,958
There is only one solution.

585
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,750
If there's actually some Guddu.

586
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,708
Then call him here, get these two married...

587
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,125
...and deport them back together.

588
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,166
Superb. Great idea! - Oh Shut up!

589
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,250
Okay, please just shut up.

590
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,333
Zoya, have you gone mad?

591
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,625
I already told you I've nothing to do with her.

592
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,416
Let's assume that you don't.

593
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,625
But the world will believe her, not you. Right?

594
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,791
And let's say we forcefully deport her.

595
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,000
Then once she's back home...

596
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,708
...she can tarnish Javed uncle's reputation, and our marriage, right?

597
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:54,291
Right.

598
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,625
And I won't let that happen.

599
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,708
So? - So?

600
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,791
So...

601
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,041
How will Guddu get here?

602
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,541
If this nuisance can come in a basket...

603
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,166
...he can still catch a bus.

604
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:10,250
He even has a passport.

605
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,333
And where will this nuisance stay until then?

606
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,041
She's your mute cousin, so keep her in your house.

607
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,583
What?

608
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,750
No...never.

609
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,583
She will stay in aunty Rifat's quarters.

610
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:22,583
And you...

611
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,250
Until I don't see your Guddu with my own eyes...

612
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,166
...I will keep my eyes on you.

613
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,541
And...and on this Guddu. Get it?

614
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,000
okay.

615
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,000
Zo...

616
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,750
Did you see something? - You saw it too.

617
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,333
I've been seeing it since I was a kid.

618
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,041
Mom often visits during her death anniversary

619
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,000
Did you see her for the first time, papa?

620
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,625
No-no...I've seen her before.

621
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,625
In fact I see her every year.

622
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,833
Rifat. - Yes.

623
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,750
Listen.

624
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,833
Tell me something. - Yes?

625
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:46,000
Have you ever seen Shaista's spirit in this house?

626
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,750
Seen her?

627
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,416
She was with me in the kitchen a while ago.

628
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,625
This house was madam's abode.

629
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,916
Where else will she be seen?

630
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,958
In Amritsar?

631
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:01,250
Didn't you see her? - Huh...you can go.

632
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,250
Goodbye. - Goodbye.

633
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:16,125
What are you angry with me for Shaista?

634
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:20,125
Even the servants of this house can see you, but not me...

635
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:30,125
Oh sorry... I didn't know you were here.

636
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:33,083
Oh, you're crying.

637
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:36,750
I'll be downstairs.

638
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,750
It's okay...this is your home.

639
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,875
Isn't there anyone in your family...

640
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,375
...who could help you speak with Guddu?

641
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,416
I am thinking about father.

642
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:13,416
Finally!

643
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,291
I am sorry.

644
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:21,333
Isn't it too late to think about your father now?

645
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,583
I should've been like you.

646
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,583
For you, your father comes first.

647
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:38,333
This time I made a really big mess.

648
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,291
I guess you can deport me.

649
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:47,583
And don't worry... I won't go to the media.

650
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:51,791
It's a question of faith now.

651
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,416
Happy...

652
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:57,916
Let Guddu come, then I'll get you two deported together.

653
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,000
I see.

654
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,000
And your father? - I'll think about father later.

655
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,708
I've called 100 times and told about a 100 lies.

656
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:17,083
But he didn't give the phone to Guddu even once.

657
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,833
What is this Bagga? - He's a big rascal.

658
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:24,000
He trapped father... with his cunning words.

659
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,125
He used to say I'll become an MLA in two years.

660
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:30,583
Tell me something about Guddu. What does he do? - Nothing.

661
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,000
There must be something. Some hobby, habit.

662
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,000
I am his hobby and habit.

663
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,000
I am serious Happy. - Me too...he does nothing.

664
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,791
If he did, wouldn't father let me marry him instead!

665
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,416
He used to strum his six-string?

666
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,208
What?

667
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,125
Six-string!

668
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:54,125
He even dropped out of college to pursue music.

669
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:02,166
What happened?

670
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,500
Music's got magic, Happy.

671
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,541
And I'll use this magic to bring Guddu here.

672
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,000
Bring him? What are you going to do?

673
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,375
Same thing that Christopher Columbus did.

674
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,583
What?

675
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,000
Search!

676
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,166
Father's leaving for China day after tomorrow.

677
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,791
I'll personally go to Amritsar and find Guddu.

678
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:32,833
Get these two married before he returns and send them back.

679
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,833
Will you really go to Amritsar?

680
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,541
I'll draw a map of Amritsar for you.

681
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,000
I'll get it from Google.

682
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,000
You just note down all of Guddu's whereabouts for me.

683
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,416
I want to make a plan. - Okay.

684
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:47,291
Because Christopher Columbus won't go alone.

685
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:48,916
Who will go with you?

686
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:52,916
Ibn-e-Batuta.

687
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,916
Mr. Junior... you can take my head.

688
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,791
I'll ask for that later Afridi, it's not necessary right now.

689
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:03,375
Please don't give me such cruel orders of accompanying you to India.

690
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,916
I've already told you that I won't go to that country...

691
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,041
I won't go... - And yes, there's another thing.

692
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:09,208
What was it? - Yes, I won't go...

693
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:10,416
You will definitely go.

694
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,500
You don't understand, Mr. Junior.

695
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,041
Under no circumstance can I even taste Indian salt.

696
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,416
You're so stupid, Afridi. - What?

697
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:25,583
You, me and almost entire Pakistan's been eating Indian salt for decades.

698
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:26,416
Huh!

699
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,208
We've been importing salt from India.

700
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,750
What do you have to say about that?

701
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,541
Oh, that way?

702
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:36,541
How long has this been going on?

703
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,208
Oh my, Allah save you from evil eye.

704
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,708
You must always dress like this.

705
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,041
You look amazing!

706
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:50,875
Yes...and father will strip these clothes off, along with my skin.

707
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:54,333
I must always dress like this.

708
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,791
I know I am troubling you.

709
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,000
But I don't have a choice.

710
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,583
Stuffed bread...he loves them.

711
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:06,583
My cooking I mean.

712
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Yeah...that's it.

713
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,791
Yeah...

714
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,416
Come on, Afridi. Come on.

715
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,041
Come on, boy...you can do it.

716
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,625
Take a step forward...

717
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,125
If he doesn't get off just push him down.

718
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,875
Who said that? - I did.

719
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:26,916
Afridi, just let it be.

720
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,958
Just come on, you can do it Afridi.

721
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:29,708
One...

722
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,250
Allah forgive me. - Two...

723
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,250
Allah-hu-Akbar. - three

724
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:46,916
This is the Punjab that's given birth...

725
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:50,750
...to cricketers like Kapil Dev and Yuvraaj.

726
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,291
I wish Kapil Dev and Yuvraaj were in Pakistan.

727
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,250
Why don't you leave Pakistan out sometimes?

728
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,666
You did make me leave it.

729
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,333
Curses.

730
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:05,625
Okay...go ask them Guddu's address.

731
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,750
Who? - Them?

732
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,333
In what language? - They are not Chinese.

733
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:15,333
They understand Urdu. Go!

734
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,250
Excuse me.

735
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,666
I said excuse me.

736
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:30,208
Does Guddu stay in this domicile?

737
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:35,750
Who are you to ask?

738
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,416
Did you hear?

739
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,166
You're too much, Afridi.

740
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:42,125
Mister, can you tell me where I can find Guddu?

741
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,125
Who the hell are you two?

742
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,000
Rehan Lahori.

743
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,166
And my manager, Hairat Gul.

744
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:57,166
Looks like they have captured a nursery school.

745
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:08,666
I need to take this call, please keep your mouth shut till I'm back.

746
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:09,416
Hello?

747
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:10,208
Yes Zoya...

748
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:16,375
When will Mr. Bagga come? - Shut up.

749
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,625
Fell asleep accidentally.

750
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,333
You know your brother doesn't sleep during the day.

751
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:26,125
So you were getting some Kayloola?

752
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,166
Your father is a Kayloola! - No no you misunderstand.

753
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:33,666
In Urdu, Kayloola means taking a nap in the day.

754
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,333
Who is he? Where did you find him?

755
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:39,375
Boss, they're from a music company.

756
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:43,666
Bajao Music Company... Lahore?

757
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,708
You are from Pakistan?

758
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,541
Tell me something Kayloola...

759
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:52,666
What do you call music in Urdu?

760
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:54,958
'Mausiqi'. - Son of a...

761
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:56,000
How dare you abuse me?

762
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,583
You're misunderstanding again.

763
00:42:58,083 --> 00:42:58,375
I am not abusing you.

764
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,333
You asked what music's called in Urdu.

765
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,291
So...in Urdu it's called 'Mausiqi'.

766
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,958
Say it... 'Mausiqi'.

767
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:06,666
'Mausikee'.

768
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,333
Not Ki...Qi, Mausiqi.

769
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,125
Has a dot above 'Qi'.

770
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,208
Now what the hell is that?

771
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:13,875
Boss... Apply a dot...

772
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,041
He's asking to apply the dot...Like on the forehead

773
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,416
You idiot am I a girl to be doing that?

774
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:18,083
Who is he?

775
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,291
Forget him, he's just the manager.

776
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:21,166
Just the manager.

777
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:22,583
You said he owns a music company.

778
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,125
Of course, I own a music company.

779
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:25,916
Sorry, I was busy on a phone call.

780
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:29,625
Are you Bagga?

781
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,500
Daman Singh Bagga! What do you want?

782
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,833
I've business with Guddu, not Bagga.

783
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:35,791
Where's Guddu?

784
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:39,000
No one's got any business with Guddu in India.

785
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,625
What business do you Pakistanis have with him?

786
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,625
What business?

787
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:55,791
Well...have you ever heard Guddu's voice?

788
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:56,916
Why?

789
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:00,166
He's...amazing, bro.

790
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:02,333
We'll make him sing... in Lahore.

791
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,000
Where did you hear Guddu's voice?

792
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,541
Bro...Youtube. - Youtube

793
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:13,000
So much talented

794
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,625
No wonder Happy fell for him.

795
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,916
Who's Happy?

796
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,125
The one your brother was supposed to marry.

797
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,750
My brother? But I am the only son to my parents.

798
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,625
The cards were distributed.

799
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,708
And on the wedding night... - What happened?

800
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,416
She ran away. - With whom?

801
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,541
She was supposed to run away with that bloody Guddu.

802
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,541
But who knows which idiot she ran away with.

803
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:43,791
Here's your Justin Bieber...

804
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:45,208
Guddu, my bro.

805
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,750
Guddu! Guddu! Guddu!

806
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,541
Come...I want to take you to your dreamland.

807
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,333
O music shop...

808
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:53,708
Give him whatever you want to right here.

809
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:57,708
Guddu won't go anywhere alone.

810
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,416
Wo...wow, Bagga Sir.

811
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:03,375
This is amazing.

812
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:07,916
We'll have to tell him whatever it is, in front of you.

813
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:09,291
Guddu won't go anywhere.

814
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,791
So how are we going to tell him?

815
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,208
Who are you? What do you want?

816
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:16,208
They want to make you sing...that too in Lahore.

817
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:19,333
Look, I am not going anywhere to sing.

818
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,708
There you go Kayloola...it's decided. Dimpy, throw them out

819
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:27,000
No no no...Stop that nonsense Bagga.

820
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,708
Sorry... Look...

821
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,333
I came all the way from Lahore to Amritsar for your benefit.

822
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,250
And you want to throw me out?

823
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,083
Benefit? What benefit?

824
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:43,583
He'll go there...sing for us... - Yeah.

825
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:46,000
I'll make a living... and you'll get your wedding.

826
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,958
Yeah.

827
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:52,125
You were saying that some Happy...ran away.

828
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,583
And you doubt him.

829
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,375
Now when he will no longer be here...

830
00:45:55,875 --> 00:46:00,125
...then whose arms will Happy fall in?

831
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,166
Bagga's!

832
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:06,791
How's your brother's plan?

833
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:09,541
Take him, take him...

834
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:12,333
So it's decided... prepare to leave.

835
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,875
My manager Hairat Gul will make all the arrangements.

836
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,541
Right, Hairat?

837
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,083
Hairat Gul!

838
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:21,250
Go he's calling you.

839
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,500
Yeah...yes yes... Rehan Lahori, of course.

840
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I already told you I won't go to Lahore.

841
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,125
And your tricks won't work on me, Bagga.

842
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:29,750
And I won't go with these hired goons.

843
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,166
Hired goons? - Son, try to understand.

844
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:33,750
He's come all the way from Lahore only for you.

845
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,875
And we're not hired, we're original.

846
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:37,041
We'll take you to your love.

847
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,375
His love for 'Mausiqi' (Music).

848
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,750
Yeah...you wont even go for the love of Mausiki?

849
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,041
Happy's love is all I need.

850
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:43,000
And you can keep your Mausiki.

851
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,916
Listen, his, mine, whosever love it is... you'll only find it in Lahore.

852
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:50,166
Yeah... Look, son...he'll get in big trouble otherwise, and me too.

853
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,500
To hell with both of you.

854
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's because of people like you...

855
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,291
...that India and Pakistan could never be friends.

856
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:56,375
Go with them, come on.

857
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,333
I've given my word. - He's given his word.

858
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,000
Try to understand brother, It's all in Lahore

859
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,750
Who is? - Happening... It's Happening.

860
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,875
Think of your dream, Guddu....

861
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:09,000
One that's in the depths of your dreams, you'll find it there.

862
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,958
One that's in the loneliness of your heart, you'll find it there.

863
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,583
One that's in your destiny, you'll find it there.

864
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,500
Yeah... - At least listen to him!

865
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,208
Otherwise I swear I will eat poison.

866
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:23,250
And not just him, I will eat it too...and make you eat it.

867
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,958
Eat!

868
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:27,041
Two Pakistanis will die in my backyard because of you...

869
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:28,125
...my ticket will get cancelled.

870
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,833
And if that happens, forget Happy I won't let you marry anyone.

871
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,000
Bagga bro, don't get emotional.

872
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,041
Please...don't get emotional, Bagga.

873
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,500
Okay.

874
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,583
Guddu, you don't want to come with us, don't come.

875
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:48,000
You don't want to sing for us, don't sing.

876
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,833
But we're fans of your music.

877
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:54,125
At least eat a bite from our hands.

878
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,291
No... - Please. - I won't eat it.

879
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:56,208
It's stuffed bread.

880
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:57,833
Why won't you eat it? - Stay away.

881
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,166
Bagga bro, he's humiliated us a lot.

882
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,708
If he doesn't eat, how will he go?

883
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:02,708
Please give us a hand.

884
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:03,625
Dimpy, lay him down.

885
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,541
Hey... - You...

886
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,166
Stay away! Stay away! Stay away!

887
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:08,708
Careful...make him sit, please..

888
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,041
We brought it especially for you from Lahore.

889
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,875
If only you had eaten it politely...you would've understood.

890
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,916
But I guess I'll have to shove this love down your throat. - Yes yes, shove it down.

891
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:18,000
Will you only make wise cracks or start shoving also?

892
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,958
Or else give that to your Brother, I'll do it for you.

893
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:21,208
Yeah...Lahori, give it to him.

894
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,083
Do it, brother!

895
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:25,083
Come on... - Open your mouth.

896
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,708
Open your mouth.

897
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,625
Great.

898
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,333
Eat it.

899
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:33,916
More...

900
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,958
More, brother!

901
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:37,750
Will you sing now?

902
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,625
Will you go to Lahore now?

903
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,041
Fantastic.

904
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:42,208
Bagga bro...that's enough.

905
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,416
Eat some more... Go to Lahore.

906
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,083
Bagga Bro...Stop it!

907
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:48,708
It's done.

908
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,125
You're simply amazing, Bagga bro.

909
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,291
The boy's said yes. - He did?

910
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:56,666
Hairat, take care of Guddu's visa and other formalities.

911
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,041
And bring him to Lahore respectfully.

912
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,583
Oh yes, of course of course

913
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:04,416
Bagga...brother...I am touched by your gestures of help

914
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,541
Touched. - You're welcome.

915
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:11,000
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Everyone! - Thank you. - Yes, Goodbye

916
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,208
Boss...these Pakistanis have so much love in them?

917
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:18,208
I was thinking that too.

918
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:22,208
Keep an eye on Guddu. Come on. - Okay, brother.

919
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,416
Is this Bagga's minion always watching you?

920
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:38,083
Tell me something...

921
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:41,625
I've met Happy... she's quite feisty.

922
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,666
She has all of Pakistan dancing to her beats in two days.

923
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:48,250
You look like a decent boy.

924
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,250
What was your need to run away with her?

925
00:49:59,125 --> 00:49:59,958
Just two months...

926
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,333
I'll get my contract from the music company.

927
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,083
The contract will come when it comes

928
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,500
But I'll have to get married as soon as I graduate.

929
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,916
For sure

930
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:12,708
Reeto's here...see you later.

931
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:18,208
You'll get married... and you'll be marrying me.

932
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:22,208
For sure

933
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:26,000
"Darling... My darling."

934
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,750
"It's the season of love."

935
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,833
"Darling... My darling."

936
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:36,041
"You're with me in every step I take."

937
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:39,291
"You're the melody from my musical instrument."

938
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,291
"You're the melody..."

939
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,000
"You're the melody..."

940
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,541
"You're the engravings on my soul."

941
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:48,166
"Yes, it's you."

942
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:49,875
"It's you."

943
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,166
"You're my life."

944
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:56,625
"I've put my faith in you."

945
00:50:57,125 --> 00:51:00,166
"God dwells in you."

946
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:04,000
"It's like my heart's connected with God."

947
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,000
"Darling... My darling."

948
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,375
"You're with me in every step I take."

949
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:12,041
"You're the melody..."

950
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:13,875
"You're the melody..."

951
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,541
"You're the melody..."

952
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,291
"You're the melody..."

953
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,000
"Yes, it's you."

954
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,791
"It's you."

955
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,541
"Yes, it's you."

956
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:26,541
"It's you."

957
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:59,625
"I kept fighting with my dreams."

958
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:05,291
"I was always afraid to say it."

959
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:12,125
"My only wish was for you to be mine."

960
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:19,125
"I think God answers my prayers as well."

961
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:22,416
"You're my peace, my obsession."

962
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:25,916
"You're my desire, my hope."

963
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:29,291
"You're my craving, and my serenity."

964
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:33,083
"You're the pain and the relief."

965
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,500
You kept saying we'll get married.

966
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,833
Here...I am getting married.

967
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:40,500
Stuff your face...

968
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,541
"Darling... My darling."

969
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:47,208
"It's the season of love."

970
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:50,250
"Darling... My darling."

971
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,250
"You're with me in every step I take."

972
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:25,708
"I spend one day... and you spend a night."

973
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:32,416
"In this love... we've shared many centuries."

974
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:39,416
"If we ever separate, the world will say..."

975
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:45,541
"You're the song that's sung only by me."

976
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,666
"Darling... My darling."

977
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:52,375
"It's the season of love."

978
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,375
"Darling... My darling."

979
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:58,666
"You're with me in every step I take."

980
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:03,208
What is it? Why have you come here?

981
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,750
This is all you can do?

982
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:09,625
Strum your guitar and cry.

983
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:10,708
Will you run away?

984
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:13,791
"Darling... My darling."

985
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:16,750
"It's the season of love."

986
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,708
Call me in the evening.

987
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:22,708
I'll go finish up with the engagement.

988
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:47,333
Usmaan, your brother's going to meet his love tomorrow.

989
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,125
So...

990
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:53,708
On that occasion...let's...

991
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:54,916
Oh...

992
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:56,750
I don't drink...I don't...

993
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,791
No?

994
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:01,833
But...it's cold tonight.

995
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,041
So you can take it for the cold.

996
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:05,250
Take it.

997
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,166
Give me your glass.

998
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,125
Come on.

999
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,250
Enough. Enough.

1000
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,833
Here.

1001
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:18,833
Cheers!

1002
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,541
You insisted and that's why I obliged...

1003
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,625
...otherwise I don't have such habits

1004
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:38,625
What...what...

1005
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,833
Can I ask you something?

1006
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:47,833
Ask anything except for Kashmir.

1007
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:55,041
Urdu is a very deadly language. - Why?

1008
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,666
Like some things might be so trivial...

1009
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,166
But in Urdu they sound so important.

1010
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:02,500
Yeah.

1011
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,208
I used to think that 'Tashreef' is something special.

1012
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:13,958
When I found out the real meaning (butt), I couldn't control my laughter...

1013
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,916
Listen. - Yeah.

1014
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:22,333
Are you mocking me?

1015
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:25,000
You're taking me to see my Happy.

1016
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,125
You think I can mock you? - No-No.

1017
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:32,125
Gurdeep Singh is not such a bad person. - No no Gurdeep

1018
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:35,041
I wasn't making fun.

1019
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:38,041
I understand...

1020
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:43,333
Usmaan... what is this called in Urdu?

1021
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,125
Oh this...

1022
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:48,000
Go do it.

1023
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,250
Do it! Do it!

1024
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:56,875
Brother Usmaan... you and Bilal are really great.

1025
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:58,875
You lied for us.

1026
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,791
You came here for us.

1027
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:03,541
And you'll take me to Lahore tomorrow.

1028
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:05,208
To my Happy.

1029
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:06,833
We'll be so happy together.

1030
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,416
I will meet with Happy... we'll get married.

1031
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,416
And we'll have...

1032
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:14,000
Hey!

1033
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
-I'll see how you get married...

1034
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,708
Brother, catch him. - Who?

1035
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,083
Brother, we'll get sc****

1036
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:22,708
Who? - Bagga's man... he's heard everything.

1037
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,041
You're unbelievable.

1038
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:28,041
Can't you look where you're peeing? - Brother...we'll be ruined.

1039
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,000
There he is. There he is.

1040
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:46,083
He went left...Left...

1041
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:50,083
That way..

1042
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:56,833
That way, let's go.

1043
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,500
Usman bro, faster! - He has fallen! He has fallen!

1044
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,916
I can't touch him!

1045
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:04,833
He is reeking. How do we catch him?

1046
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,500
Keep an eye on him, I'll find some papers.

1047
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,500
Paper's no good... give me that rod.

1048
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,250
Rod.

1049
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,250
We'll beat him with the stick and tie him up in the sack.

1050
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:12,875
Sit down.

1051
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,291
Wear it. Wear it. Wear it.

1052
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:20,291
Sit down.

1053
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,000
Go on...and make a name for yourself.

1054
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,000
Round of applause!

1055
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,875
And listen...

1056
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:45,916
Don't worry about Amritsar.

1057
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:48,583
We just want to see you progress.

1058
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:52,791
That too in a different country.

1059
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:57,541
Kayloola... you're really cute.

1060
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:03,916
If I get a chance, your brother will definitely come to Lahore to meet you.

1061
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:07,625
Swear on me Bagga bro, do pay us a visit once.

1062
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:09,166
Of course we will.

1063
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:12,208
Get going...come on.

1064
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:15,541
Get going to Pakistan.

1065
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:17,541
Bagga? Bye, love you.

1066
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:20,791
Love you too, Guddu.

1067
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,833
Congratulations, brother.

1068
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:28,666
Now that he's gone we can be at peace!

1069
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,291
Is that Rajinder who's running towards us like a bull?

1070
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:32,625
Move aside.

1071
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:33,708
It is him, brother.

1072
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,916
What's wrong with him?

1073
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:39,333
Brother...stop the bus.

1074
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:42,708
Did you spend the night with a pig? I can't stand the stench.

1075
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,000
Brother, they are no music company guys.

1076
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,583
What? - Those guys from Lahore made a fool of you.

1077
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,625
They'll get Guddu married there because...

1078
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:53,000
Happy is in Pakistan.

1079
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,416
Dimpy, stop the bus!

1080
00:59:56,916 --> 01:00:00,416
Boss, the bus is in Pakistan.

1081
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,958
Lord...

1082
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:19,541
These idiots burned my papa's truck. - Dimple, keep these grass bundles..

1083
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:21,000
..on the other side of the terrace.. - I hope they don't set me on fire...

1084
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,375
And that grass lying at the back...

1085
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:26,333
Hey...

1086
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:27,625
You.

1087
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,875
Wasn't that your truck? - Hello.

1088
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:32,208
Aren't you the one that helped Happy elope? - No, no.

1089
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:33,291
Sweety! Rinky!

1090
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:34,875
Dimple! Dolly...come out everyone. - You offered me desert that day...

1091
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:35,625
He's the rascal.

1092
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,416
No-no, you're mistaken.

1093
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:38,791
Mistaken... - No...

1094
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,375
I'll set you straight, you rascal.

1095
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,750
I swear I will take your life today.

1096
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,000
Why will you take my life?

1097
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:45,750
Stop hitting me with that broom...

1098
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:46,750
It's covered with dung.

1099
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,208
Look, I did try to help Happy elope.

1100
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,125
But I couldn't.

1101
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:50,625
And on top of that they burnt my father's truck.

1102
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:52,000
You... to hell with your truck

1103
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,750
I'm going to tell father all about you.

1104
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:54,625
Father!

1105
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,250
Why will you tell father anything?

1106
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,166
Take this letter. Guddu has sent it.

1107
01:00:58,666 --> 01:00:59,250
Guddu... - Give it to uncle.

1108
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,416
And I'll clear your misconceptions later.

1109
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:02,416
Father... - Bye.

1110
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:03,958
Swine, he's making a run for it.

1111
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,416
Don't ever show your face here again.

1112
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:09,416
This is a madhouse!

1113
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,000
Where's uncle? - Papa!

1114
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:36,416
What do you want now?

1115
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:39,583
Papa...

1116
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:43,583
..we've found Happy.

1117
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,750
Boss, get to the point.

1118
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,250
He thinks she's in the next lane... he's going on-foot.

1119
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,833
Papa...

1120
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:05,833
Happy...is in Lahore.

1121
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:15,083
Where? - Pakistan.

1122
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:17,541
Stop talking about bloodshed...

1123
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:20,000
...and listen to what I am saying.

1124
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,791
Only I can take you there.

1125
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:27,833
Because those officials will hand-over the girl only to her relatives.

1126
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,625
Come with me quietly.

1127
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:35,000
Let's bring her back here, and get her married to me.

1128
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,416
She's already made me dance to her tunes

1129
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:38,875
And I did.

1130
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:40,708
Not anymore

1131
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:44,041
Brother, it'll take around 4-5 days to get there.

1132
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:48,125
And what if... - Leave all that to me.

1133
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,208
So what if it's Lahore.

1134
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:52,625
Your brother is adamant.

1135
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:56,083
We'll cross the border too.

1136
01:02:56,583 --> 01:03:00,083
Father...please, come here.

1137
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:13,416
Father, Guddu's friend gave this.

1138
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,916
Read it.

1139
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:17,791
"Greetings, father."

1140
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,250
"Happy is in La..."

1141
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,083
"Happy is in Lahore and she's safe."

1142
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:25,750
"I am going to bring her back."

1143
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:29,375
"I didn't want to leave without your blessings."

1144
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,958
"But I couldn't muster the courage to face you."

1145
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,958
"Even if I've to lay down my life..."

1146
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:39,041
"...bringing Happy back home is my responsibility."

1147
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:41,375
"Pray to God for our well-being."

1148
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:45,916
"Your good-for-nothing son...Guddu."

1149
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:48,208
Boss, we have a contact across the border

1150
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:51,416
Should I call him?

1151
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:54,791
Yes, papa. What do we do?

1152
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,291
Let's go to Pakistan.

1153
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,750
Ishtiyaq Khan's constituency is the ideal constituency...

1154
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,166
...in entire Pakistan, sir.

1155
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:04,666
Electricity, water, corruption, unemployment, unmarried girls...

1156
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:07,041
...are some of the small issues.

1157
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:10,041
And according to you this event is a solution to all your problems.

1158
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:11,583
Think about it, sir.

1159
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:13,416
100 couples getting married altogether.

1160
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,333
Unemployed young men will find a job...

1161
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,000
...unmarried girls will no longer be unmarried.

1162
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,958
We're only facing a little budget issue.

1163
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,000
100 couples, huh?

1164
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,041
Try getting one married, it's not that easy.

1165
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,333
Wow...what a statement.

1166
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:33,166
Great.

1167
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,416
You've no idea what I just said, do you?

1168
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,208
Absolutely right, sir. Absolutely right.

1169
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,250
Mr. Junior! Mr. Junior! Mr. Junior!

1170
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,000
The Chinese have cancelled the conference.

1171
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,250
What? - Yes.

1172
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,375
Mr. Senior is returning today afternoon.

1173
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,375
What? - Yes!

1174
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,291
I have to go. - Of course, yours is an international issue.

1175
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,541
By Allah, look at what you've turned into.

1176
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:52,333
Goodbye. - Goodbye

1177
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:54,416
Oh Lord, cancel his flight... Take it to Africa

1178
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:55,875
He speaks English very well, did you see?

1179
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:57,791
Afridi. - Yes, Mr. Junior.

1180
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,416
We've arrived in Pakistan with your guest-of-honor from India.

1181
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:05,208
And very soon we'll be arriving at your abode.

1182
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:09,041
No. The Pride-of-Pakistan is returning to his abode.

1183
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,541
Take our guest-of-honor from India to some hotel.

1184
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:12,583
And inform.

1185
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:15,416
I'll send the gift-from-India and the headache-of-my-life there.

1186
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:18,375
Sir...I also had an important piece of news.

1187
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:18,958
Speak.

1188
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,958
The enemy-of-love Bagga has learned about our intentions.

1189
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:28,625
And how did that happen?

1190
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,875
A stupid sycophant overheard my conversation..

1191
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:33,500
..with the guest-of-honor from India.

1192
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,875
Any other good news...

1193
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,291
..otherwise hang up and spare my life.

1194
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:40,291
One small advice.

1195
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,916
The flight that was supposed to take...

1196
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:46,583
...the detainees to Delhi 5 days later, I had included their names as well.

1197
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:50,291
But now that Mr. Senior has returned, so...

1198
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,583
5 days.

1199
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,166
Damnit Afridi!

1200
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:58,208
I see...

1201
01:05:58,708 --> 01:05:59,333
Damnit!

1202
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:00,875
Do you know what that means? - No.

1203
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,625
He asked us to get a taxi.

1204
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,625
Come on.

1205
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,416
What's the point in sitting here?

1206
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,833
What's the point in standing?

1207
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:20,666
We'll deal with Bagga when he gets here.

1208
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:22,500
We'll make some other plan for the wedding.

1209
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,625
At least Guddu's here.

1210
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:28,250
Happy...you're unbelievable.

1211
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,041
We're getting into one trouble after another.

1212
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:32,708
And you... are still going headstrong.

1213
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,875
Unaffected.

1214
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,833
Do you think life is a film?

1215
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,041
No...I treat life as life.

1216
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:43,833
I won't let father or Bagga intimidate me,

1217
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,625
And what's the worst that can happen with me?

1218
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:50,083
I won't get what I want. Right?

1219
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:55,833
But at least I'll be satisfied that I tried my best.

1220
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:58,416
If you two have finished exchanging dialogues...

1221
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,375
...can we finish the coffee?

1222
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,291
I want to see Guddu.

1223
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:06,291
And I am sure Happy wants to see him too.

1224
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:15,250
Yes, Fakhru uncle. All fine? - What fine? Nothing's fine.

1225
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,291
Mr. Junior, Mr. Senior has returned home.

1226
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:23,000
And Zoya's father is here too. - What?

1227
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,166
Did this have to happen now?

1228
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,583
Uncle...this is a trial for you and aunt Rifat.

1229
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,000
I don't care what you have to do.

1230
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,708
But don't let him mention Happy at all.

1231
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:34,833
Definitely not, Mr. Junior.

1232
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,083
Definitely not.

1233
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:37,750
Definitely not.

1234
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,541
What happened? - Your father's at my home.

1235
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,916
What if he mentions about the mute cousin?

1236
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:44,000
I am going home now.

1237
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,250
You can coordinate with Afridi for Guddu's hotel.

1238
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,958
Bring me the check.

1239
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:52,250
This feels just like back home.

1240
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,250
Just like Yash sir showed us...in 'Veer-Zara'.

1241
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,583
What are you thinking?

1242
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:04,583
I was thinking...I wish Yash Chopra was in Pakistan.

1243
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:12,708
Usmaan ...call up Happy.

1244
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,416
Be patient.

1245
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,291
Mr. Junior... will take you to Happy.

1246
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,583
In fact, he would've already united you two...

1247
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,666
...if Mr. Senior hadn't suddenly arrived from China.

1248
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,791
You're right, Mr. Zia.

1249
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:28,708
Our country isn't functioning to its fullest capacity.

1250
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,000
It's hard to find a powerful politician.

1251
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,583
Why not?

1252
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,250
There's Bilal.

1253
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,916
Bilal has all the makings.

1254
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:40,416
Of course. I am sure one day this boy will change the history of Pakistan.

1255
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:41,583
Of course.

1256
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,041
Actually...even I have a talented nephew, he's from Peshawar.

1257
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:47,541
But he can't do speech and rallies.

1258
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,250
Unfortunately...he stammers.

1259
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,500
I'll introduce him to Bilal someday.

1260
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,083
By the way, where is Bilal?

1261
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:58,958
Must be doing some kind of public service.

1262
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:02,750
I did meet Bilal the other day at home. - I see.

1263
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:07,166
And with him was that... - Sugar?

1264
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:08,583
Sugar, Mr. Senior?

1265
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:09,875
What's wrong with you, Fakhru?

1266
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:14,125
You know I am diabetic. I have stopped taking sugar since a long time.

1267
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,083
Pardon my insolence, Mr. Senior.

1268
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:19,291
I was asking Zia sir. - So ask him.

1269
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:22,000
Sugar?

1270
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,666
One spoon. Thanks. - Yes.

1271
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,000
So what were you saying? - I was saying...

1272
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,291
Only one spoon? - Yes, yes only one spoon.

1273
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:30,250
Yes.

1274
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,708
Zia sir, what were you saying?

1275
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:35,041
I was saying, when he came home...

1276
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:38,291
...there was a girl with him, she was from Karachi...

1277
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:40,000
What the hell man!

1278
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,375
Be careful...be careful, Zia sir.

1279
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,708
I held it properly, I wonder what happened.

1280
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:46,541
Stop staring at him...give him a tissue. - Yes, yes, yes...

1281
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:47,791
Here you go.

1282
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,708
And go call Rifat. - Of course.

1283
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:51,583
I'm done here...

1284
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,250
Yes, so Zia sir what were you saying?

1285
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,583
When you met Bilal? - Yes, I was saying...

1286
01:09:57,083 --> 01:10:00,000
Greetings, sir. Greetings, Zia sir...you called?

1287
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,375
Yes, I did.

1288
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:05,166
Stand quietly. We're talking.

1289
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:06,750
Yes, Zia sir. - Yes...

1290
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:12,666
So, your niece... - W-w-why are you scolding me?

1291
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,541
I've been working for you for all these years...

1292
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,125
...and you didn't fulfill your promise either.

1293
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,166
What nonsense? What promise?

1294
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:19,583
Your promise to gift a necklace to Huriya.

1295
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:22,125
Huriya? - My niece, Huriya.

1296
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:23,791
I've selected the design as well.

1297
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,583
If you won't do it, then who else will?

1298
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,583
She's a poor kid, Zia sir.

1299
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,208
If only madam had been alive, then...

1300
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:33,333
Fine-fine... you'll get the necklace.

1301
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:37,333
Now go... Leave!

1302
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,500
Yes, Zia sir what were you saying?

1303
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,250
I was saying that your mute niece from...

1304
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,333
You'll get the necklace for me? - Yes, I will-I will-I will.

1305
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:51,333
Now go from here.

1306
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,875
Rifat! Rifat! Rifat!

1307
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:01,375
How can someone shoulder so much burden at this age, Zia sir?

1308
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:02,125
Yes.

1309
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,666
These days Rifat often faints. - I see.

1310
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:08,000
Should I call the doctor? - Yes yes call the doctor.

1311
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:08,666
Yes.

1312
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:11,333
And sprinkle some water on her.

1313
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:13,166
Javed sir. - Yes.

1314
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:16,541
Let's schedule the meeting for tomorrow? - Yes...yes...

1315
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,833
We'll keep it for tomorrow. - Great.

1316
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:20,583
See you.

1317
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:22,583
Fakhru, go get some water.

1318
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:24,041
Sprinkle water on her.

1319
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:25,916
Javed sir. - Yes.

1320
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,791
Give Happy my love. - Happy?

1321
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:31,708
Happy who?

1322
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:35,000
We tried our best, Junior... but Zia sir told him everything.

1323
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:35,750
Everything!

1324
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,250
He came here with the intentions of saying it.

1325
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,250
And not just the fake mute girl...

1326
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,333
...he even spoke about a stammering nephew.

1327
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:42,916
I even spilled tea on him but it didn't work.

1328
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:46,916
Didn't work.

1329
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:55,000
You called?

1330
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,833
What do you know about Happy? - Happy.

1331
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:02,125
Same thing which the world does. - What?

1332
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:05,416
Well 'Happy' is a state of mind...

1333
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,916
...that gives emotional happiness.

1334
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:11,000
I am not talking about 'state of mind'.

1335
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,166
I am talking about the girl...

1336
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:17,958
...whom you introduced to Mr. Zia as your mute cousin last week...

1337
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:22,416
Last week? - Yes.

1338
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,375
Was it at his home? - Of course.

1339
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,833
Yeah...

1340
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,291
Although it was just Zoya and me...

1341
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:33,625
...but according to uncle Zia there were two more people there.

1342
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:38,750
Meaning? - I mean uncle Zia kept saying that...

1343
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:43,083
...his nephew from Peshawar was also there, who stammers.

1344
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:49,250
And your niece from Karachi, who is mute.

1345
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:55,416
And...if I remember correctly he kept saying...

1346
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:58,250
"The nephew spilled tea... then he said no."

1347
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,250
"No, I spilled it...then he said it just tipped over."

1348
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,916
Something like that.

1349
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:06,333
Oh my, God.

1350
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:10,000
What's wrong, father? - Even today...

1351
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,958
Did he see his nephew and niece here as well?

1352
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,958
Schizophrenia?

1353
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:21,291
He's crazy?

1354
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:25,958
Does...Zoya know?

1355
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:29,375
Poor thing... since her childhood days...

1356
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:34,166
...she's been hearing of another mother who's from Rawalpindi, and is deaf.

1357
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,125
Why didn't you tell me?

1358
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,500
How could I tell you, father?

1359
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,166
We're childhood friends, you even fixed our marriage.

1360
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:45,333
And...I know that's for the best interest of the country.

1361
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:49,166
And you've always said that no one's above our country.

1362
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:53,166
So for the sake of my country... I stayed quiet...

1363
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:59,000
Unbelievable, son.

1364
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,791
Look at what you have turned into.

1365
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,000
I'm so proud of you.

1366
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,958
So proud of you.

1367
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:13,291
Father, I've thought of an idea for your campaign.

1368
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,208
Yes...tell me, son.

1369
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:18,708
Why don't we get 100 couples married altogether?

1370
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,500
You know...poor boys and girls, in one grand event.

1371
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,250
And along with this announcement, Zoya and I will announce our wedding date too.

1372
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,250
You know, to the media, to the public.

1373
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,541
It will benefit your campaign...

1374
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:33,666
...and 100 couples will do the job...5 days later.

1375
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:37,666
Amazing.

1376
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:43,541
I can see the future Prime Minister of this country in you.

1377
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:47,166
And I am sure...you will change the history of Pakistan!

1378
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:49,958
...of Pakistan, I know Dad!

1379
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:52,291
But how will we arrange it in 5 days?

1380
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:53,666
We'll manage it, father.

1381
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:57,666
It must happen in 5 days.

1382
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:03,166
How many times more will I have to lie?

1383
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,541
Amazing, Mr. Junior.

1384
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,583
Finally you've become an A-grade politician.

1385
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,166
With a single blow you knocked out Zia sir...

1386
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,541
...and made things easier for Happy and Guddu too.

1387
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,583
Let's hope we wrap up everything before Bagga arrives.

1388
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:19,958
Allah has made a strange relation between you and this girl?

1389
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:23,875
A boy that never stood up in front of Mr. Senior for his own desires...

1390
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:29,416
...is doing everything possible for this stranger...

1391
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,833
Yeah, Zo!

1392
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,208
What?

1393
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:36,375
When? How?

1394
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:37,166
Relax, Zo.

1395
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,875
Just relax. Just get a hold of yourself. I am coming right now.

1396
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:42,000
Sir...

1397
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,708
Happy's missing. - Missing, again?

1398
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:49,708
Rasheed Lala speaking.

1399
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:53,000
Your parcel has been picked up

1400
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,083
Day after tomorrow?

1401
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:56,375
Okay.

1402
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:59,791
My man will pick you up from the bus depot.

1403
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:01,583
Boss, do something.

1404
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:03,375
Irfan and Moin are in a bad state.

1405
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:06,666
Do you want to give Rasheed Lala a bad name?

1406
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,416
You can't handle a girl?

1407
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:10,583
Come on.

1408
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,125
Boss, I am quitting this job.

1409
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,291
Get inside.

1410
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:15,583
Water... brother, water.

1411
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,250
Open her mouth, I want to talk to her.

1412
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:21,250
Me? - Yes, you.

1413
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:26,875
Listen, girl... - You want me to listen? Me?

1414
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:28,041
You listen...

1415
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:32,250
Just set me free and I will mop the floor with you and your sycophants...

1416
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,625
...or my name isn't Happy.

1417
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:37,416
Bloody oafs, how dare you abduct me? How dare you!

1418
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:39,833
You guys have no idea what you've done.

1419
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:43,166
And you, rotten apple... you're their leader, right?

1420
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,291
Go and round up some more boys.

1421
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:50,208
Once I free myself, you won't be able to save yourselves.

1422
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:53,208
What are you staring at? - Shut her up. Shut her up.

1423
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:54,708
I won't spare anyone.

1424
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:56,958
What do we do, boss? - Dance!

1425
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:58,125
Bloody donkey!

1426
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,875
Don't open her mouth at any cost.

1427
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:00,791
Understand.

1428
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:04,291
Give her whatever she wants through a hole in her gag.

1429
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:06,250
Call up Jalal and tell him to send more boys.

1430
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,708
8-10-12... any number of boys available.

1431
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:12,208
Don't take that gag out!

1432
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:13,666
I don't understand what you're saying.

1433
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:14,958
Afridi, I am telling you...

1434
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:16,291
Afridi, I am telling you she was sitting on the left.

1435
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:17,791
She was sitting on the left, and disappeared.

1436
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,000
No, when I got down...

1437
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,500
Look... - How can you disappear? - Not me.

1438
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,916
Bagga. Bagga.

1439
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:27,041
This is Bagga's doing.

1440
01:17:27,541 --> 01:17:29,541
But...the address?

1441
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:31,083
How difficult can it be, Afridi?

1442
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,375
Maybe someone was following you from the bus depot.

1443
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:35,916
Waiting for him to get here...

1444
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,958
But...what do we do now?

1445
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:40,041
Bagga's abducted her. - Hmmm.

1446
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:43,208
Then he must be coming here too.

1447
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:47,666
There's just one way to get here.

1448
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:50,083
Make arrangements, Afridi.

1449
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:51,750
If he sets foot in the bus depot...

1450
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,541
...he's immediately picked up by the patrolling car.

1451
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:58,250
His men abducted Happy, we'll abduct Bagga.

1452
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,583
Guddu!

1453
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:04,333
Guddu! - It's all a mess.

1454
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:06,416
She's already been through a lot because of me.

1455
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:09,791
God knows how much more she will have to suffer?

1456
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:13,750
I...just...hope nothing wrong has happened to her.

1457
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,541
She will be fine.

1458
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:19,166
You love her, don't you know her?

1459
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:20,875
If she shows her true colors...

1460
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,166
...then those who abducted her will bring her back.

1461
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:27,333
And apologise too.

1462
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,916
She's Happy.

1463
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,375
Happy.

1464
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:35,375
She's much stronger than you and I.

1465
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,875
Zoya...we'll continue preparations for the wedding.

1466
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:45,916
Happy will definitely get married on that same day...

1467
01:18:46,416 --> 01:18:50,375
...and return to India on that same flight.

1468
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:52,250
Guddu

1469
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,250
Try to find out when he will leave from Amritsar.

1470
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:58,833
And if we can find out his Lahore contacts, even better.

1471
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,333
Afridi...

1472
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:05,333
Look, Mr. Junior, the problem is...

1473
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:25,500
We'll find Happy.

1474
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,666
I was 17 years old... when father brought me away...

1475
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,916
...from Faislabad Cricket Camp.

1476
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:34,333
Every night I would think about running away.

1477
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:38,250
Chasing happiness, chasing my dreams...

1478
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,625
It's been 16 years... but I could never muster the courage.

1479
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:44,000
Happy never thinks for a moment.

1480
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:48,250
She just runs away.

1481
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:53,833
My way of living life is wrong, hers is right.

1482
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,833
And I won't let it proved otherwise.

1483
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:08,791
Rawalpindi. - Huh?

1484
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:12,791
The cricket camp was in Rawalpindi.

1485
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:24,125
I love you. - I love you too.

1486
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:41,166
"I've 100 dreams...but one life."

1487
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:47,375
"How do I choose what I want?"

1488
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:53,708
"Maybe you won't say yes..."

1489
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:58,958
"Yet I am waiting for you to say no."

1490
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:02,000
"You're the journey, you're the path."

1491
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,166
"You're the caravan."

1492
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:10,791
"How do I walk without you?"

1493
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:13,875
"Just be my friend."

1494
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:17,000
"Just be my companion."

1495
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,750
"Walk a few steps along with me..."

1496
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,333
"...even if you choose to be a stranger later."

1497
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,333
"Just be my friend."

1498
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:29,500
"Just be my companion."

1499
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,166
"Walk a few steps along with me..." - Greetings, respected guests.

1500
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:36,750
I am really happy to share this news with you...

1501
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:41,083
...that the future leader of a futuristic Pakistan and my son Bilal Ahmed...

1502
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:46,000
...has made an emotional and noble decision of...

1503
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:52,083
...marrying the daughter of Lahore's well-known businessman Mr. Zia Rehmani.

1504
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:55,916
And I am sure that this step will be a hallmark...

1505
01:21:56,416 --> 01:22:01,625
...which will change the history of Pakistan.

1506
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,291
Did you speak with Wahab?

1507
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:07,125
Not yet sir but I've put 8-10 officers on the job...

1508
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:10,208
Send Happy's picture to Wahab and have him call me.

1509
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:13,541
Yes, right away.

1510
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:15,416
Congratulations.

1511
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:18,000
Huh?

1512
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,083
Our wedding date's been fixed.

1513
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:25,291
Oh yeah...congratulations.

1514
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:28,166
Bilal, the media's calling you for some pictures.

1515
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:32,166
Tell them we're coming.

1516
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:44,916
"After meeting you my heart was assured."

1517
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:51,166
"I look the most beautiful in the mirror."

1518
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:57,375
"When you skirt your eyes, I feel..."

1519
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:02,916
"Everyone else looks better than me."

1520
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:06,083
"Go if you want...take your loyalty."

1521
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:09,083
"Take your wishes."

1522
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:14,750
"Just give me that one look."

1523
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,875
"Just be my friend."

1524
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:20,958
"Just be my companion."

1525
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:24,708
"Walk a few steps along with me..."

1526
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,291
"...even if you choose to be a stranger later."

1527
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:30,375
"Just be my friend."

1528
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,500
"Just be my companion."

1529
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,125
"Walk a few steps along with me..."

1530
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:41,125
"...even if you choose to be a stranger later."

1531
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,708
He's arriving by tomorrow's bus. - 100 percent?

1532
01:23:57,208 --> 01:23:57,791
Winkle told me.

1533
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:03,250
Bagga's man told him this. - Fantastic...superb...

1534
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,625
Afridi...Bagga's arriving by tomorrow's bus.

1535
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:08,666
Look, someone will definitely go to receive him.

1536
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:12,666
He'll tell us where Happy is.

1537
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:17,791
Brother...

1538
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:21,791
Will you have coffee?

1539
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:30,583
Brother, can I ask you something?

1540
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:33,000
Ask.

1541
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,625
Let it be...I'll feel really small if I do.

1542
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:41,000
You can think about it, But you can't ask?

1543
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:48,541
You see, brother... Happy is one in a million.

1544
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:51,583
And I am not saying this because I love her.

1545
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:54,666
She is!

1546
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:57,791
Once someone gets to know her...

1547
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:02,458
...They can't help themselves from falling in love with her.

1548
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:08,750
That day...when you were talking about her...

1549
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:13,541
I realized you've gotten to know her

1550
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:17,541
So I thought to ask.

1551
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:23,083
Do you want an answer or the truth?

1552
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:27,083
Let the truth be... just give me an answer.

1553
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,041
You know Madhubala...

1554
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:41,208
..used to be my dad's favorite.

1555
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:47,750
He would always tease mom saying she's not as beautiful as Madhubala.

1556
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,541
Mom would laugh it off.

1557
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:53,833
Do you know why?

1558
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:56,416
Because Madhubala was also one in a million.

1559
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:59,083
Everyone loved her.

1560
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:03,083
Did it make a difference?

1561
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:07,208
What really matters...

1562
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:11,208
...is who Madhubala actually loved.

1563
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,041
For the next five days we are responsible...

1564
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:33,166
...for the safety of entire Lahore.

1565
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:36,791
Entire Lahore? - Of course...entire Lahore.

1566
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:40,791
And whoever is not with me can step back now.

1567
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,083
We've received information...

1568
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:58,833
...that a very dangerous, cunning and a lowlife Indian spy...

1569
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:01,708
...can enter our city any moment.

1570
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:04,875
So we must apprehend him at any cost.

1571
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:08,791
Alive or...

1572
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,791
Alive.

1573
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:17,125
Are you all with me? - Yes Sir.

1574
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:20,500
You just have to take custody, let me handle the rest.

1575
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,958
Fine, you can handle the rest.

1576
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,666
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1577
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:30,875
Calm down, papa. We'll find her. - That's not it.

1578
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:32,833
I've been controlling it from Amritsar.

1579
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,166
I'll just go relieve myself.

1580
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,291
Fine, go, go... - Yes.

1581
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:38,333
Don't forget to read the signboards. - Of course.

1582
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:42,333
Don't get in the wrong place. It is a foreign country

1583
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:50,833
Just a minute...

1584
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:01,416
Are you Bagga?

1585
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:02,916
Daman Singh Bagga!

1586
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:05,333
Did Rasheed send you? - Yes-Yes, let's go.

1587
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:09,166
Wait, let the old man return. - What old man?

1588
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:10,291
The girl's father.

1589
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:11,375
He's gone to the toilet, will be right back.

1590
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:15,375
Hands up!

1591
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,958
Kayloola, you.

1592
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:23,458
In a police costume? - It's not a costume, it's my uniform.

1593
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:25,791
You fool, mind your manners...

1594
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:29,375
...you're standing in front of ASP Usman Afridi.

1595
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:31,125
You humiliated us a lot, didn't you?

1596
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:34,000
Now give us a chance to show some hospitality too.

1597
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:34,875
Yes but...all this? - Amjad.

1598
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:35,625
Sir.

1599
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:38,875
Throw these two fools into the police jeep. - Sir.

1600
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,166
Hey but...

1601
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:41,791
Just listen! - ofcourse we'll listen

1602
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:45,791
Don't you respect your guests? - We'll show you

1603
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:53,250
Mr. Junior, Bagga has been arrested.

1604
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,458
Along with the other idiot who came to receive him.

1605
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,750
Brilliant, Afridi! - I know Mr. Junior

1606
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,166
Throw Bagga behind bars...

1607
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:03,458
...and find out where happy is from the other idiot.

1608
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:07,666
Bagga's been arrested.

1609
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:10,916
Great. Great news. - Yeah...

1610
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:14,166
I'll handle the venue preparations along with Ishtiyaq sir.

1611
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:16,416
Let me know when you find out about Happy.

1612
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:19,458
I'll join you guys.

1613
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:23,458
Zoya... Thank you.

1614
01:29:31,791 --> 01:29:37,166
Your Mr.Junior...is the owner of that fraud music company, right? - Yes.

1615
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,333
In all these years I spent in politics...

1616
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:43,000
...I never imagined that our neighboring country will be responsible...

1617
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:47,000
...for sabotaging your brother's wedding.

1618
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:51,000
My brother?

1619
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,666
You never do your job properly...

1620
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:54,250
Did you fill diesel in the van?

1621
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,083
Brother, both their phones are unreachable.

1622
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:00,416
Unreachable? Let me see.

1623
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:03,416
Brother, tell Jalal to keep the parcel

1624
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:06,708
Shaukat just took her to the bathroom, she slammed the door so hard...

1625
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:10,208
Shut your radio programme!

1626
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:13,166
They can't just disappear in thin air.

1627
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:16,083
I think this is a big game.

1628
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:19,958
ISI...RAW level.

1629
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:21,666
Allah have mercy.

1630
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:23,875
Mister, have you seen this girl? - No!

1631
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,375
Mister, have you seen this girl? - No!

1632
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:31,875
Mister, have you seen this girl? - No!

1633
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:35,416
Mister, have you seen this girl? - Who is she?

1634
01:30:35,916 --> 01:30:36,916
She is my daughter.

1635
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:40,375
She came from Amritsar to Lahore by mistake.

1636
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,791
God knows what trouble she is in?

1637
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:44,541
It's all my fault.

1638
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:46,166
There's no point in getting disappointed, mister.

1639
01:30:46,666 --> 01:30:49,333
Have you filed a missing report of her? - No, I haven't.

1640
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:51,166
Here, have some tea.

1641
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:53,541
Filing a missing report won't do you any good either.

1642
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:55,666
You'll need the help of someone influential

1643
01:30:56,166 --> 01:30:58,416
Someone who's got connections in the embassy or the consulate.

1644
01:30:58,916 --> 01:31:01,500
Who are such guys?

1645
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,791
He is.

1646
01:31:05,291 --> 01:31:06,500
Wasim Akram?

1647
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,458
No, on the TV.

1648
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:10,916
Mr. Javed Ahmed.

1649
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:12,375
He is the ex-Governor.

1650
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,875
I see...where can I find him?

1651
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:16,208
It's not that easy to meet him.

1652
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:18,083
You'll need to get an appointment first.

1653
01:31:18,583 --> 01:31:22,083
Can you give me his address? - Of course.

1654
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:28,083
Here you go.

1655
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:34,750
Here you go, mister. - Thank you.

1656
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:42,208
Here's the money for the tea. - Thank you.

1657
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:50,958
Hey...who was he? What was he asking you?

1658
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:52,458
He was an Indian.

1659
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:54,083
And was asking for Javed Ahmed Sir's address.

1660
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:55,125
And you gave it to him.

1661
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:57,833
Of course, after all he paid for the cup of tea.

1662
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:01,750
Unlike you. - You fool!

1663
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,041
Any identification? - He was from India Sir.

1664
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:07,958
He looked well-trained.

1665
01:32:08,458 --> 01:32:11,750
And sir, there was a pouch under his shirt.

1666
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,791
Pouch? - Yes, sir. Pouch.

1667
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:16,208
I fear that Mr. Ahmed's life...

1668
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:18,458
Immediately make a sketch of that man.

1669
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,500
And send it to every police station in the city.

1670
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,541
Put up his posters all over the city.

1671
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:27,541
I want this man! - Yes, sir.

1672
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:33,208
All well, Afridi? - Don't know, Mr. Junior.

1673
01:32:33,708 --> 01:32:37,208
Out of the pan...and into the fire.

1674
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:42,125
"This Indian has entered Pakistan..."

1675
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:46,166
"...with the intentions of attacking the ex-governor Javed Ahmed?"

1676
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:48,208
Read ahead.

1677
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:51,208
"If you see him anywhere, inform us immediately."

1678
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:53,708
Now who is he?

1679
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,500
Father? - Father? Whose father?

1680
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,625
Happy's father.

1681
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:01,083
Why would Happy's father want to kill Javed uncle?

1682
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:02,250
I don't know...

1683
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,500
Is this news correct? - His posters have been put up all over the city.

1684
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,041
Something's definitely wrong.

1685
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:08,666
Why would Happy's father want to kill your father?

1686
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:11,208
We'll deal with this later, let's finish this job first.

1687
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:15,208
Address. - This imbecile will tell us.

1688
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:29,083
Listen up...

1689
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:30,916
Make a team of two.

1690
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:32,291
You go left... and you enter from South.

1691
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:33,916
Amjad, you lead them - Yes, sir.

1692
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:35,000
Stay with him.

1693
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:35,708
Come on...come on.

1694
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:39,708
Follow me, quietly. - Yes, sir.

1695
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:51,708
Brother, if they've kept Happy here...

1696
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:55,708
...where are their men?

1697
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,625
Are you sure this is the place?

1698
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:02,125
How many guards inside?

1699
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,416
How would I know?

1700
01:34:03,916 --> 01:34:06,083
I think this is a very bad idea.

1701
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:08,833
How will we get that Indian out of a Police station? - Shut up.

1702
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:09,958
Come out. Come out.

1703
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:11,500
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1704
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,833
Do you want to get me killed?

1705
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:15,000
"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!"

1706
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:16,791
What is this? Your aunt's wedding party?

1707
01:34:17,291 --> 01:34:19,083
Walk quietly.

1708
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:23,083
Carefully.

1709
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,875
Come here.

1710
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:32,000
Go and create a diversion. Go on.

1711
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,000
Quietly or you'll get a beating...

1712
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:48,500
Didn't we pass from here before?

1713
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,333
Zoya, where are you wandering?

1714
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:51,916
You will get lost.

1715
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:55,208
They don't even have a fan... how could Happy be staying here?

1716
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:56,833
That's true... metal everywhere.

1717
01:34:57,333 --> 01:35:00,833
Come on.

1718
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:07,250
Hey, what are you doing?

1719
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:12,791
Just a minute, brother. The boy's getting the key.

1720
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,583
Hurry up.

1721
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:18,583
Open it up.

1722
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:40,875
This one.

1723
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:46,000
Which one of you is Rasheed? - That's me.

1724
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,500
You couldn't come yourself to the bus depot?

1725
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,833
First the girl's father ran away...

1726
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:51,500
...and that fool you sent, sided with the police in a second.

1727
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,666
But you told me nothing about the father...

1728
01:35:53,166 --> 01:35:56,666
Get in.

1729
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:02,000
Come on.

1730
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,708
Be careful.

1731
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:08,708
Rascals have kept her quite inside.

1732
01:36:15,916 --> 01:36:16,708
No need to even try, son.

1733
01:36:17,208 --> 01:36:18,000
Put your hands up.

1734
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,500
Zoya, have you lost it?

1735
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,208
Happy! Happy! Happy!

1736
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:28,416
Happy, how are you?

1737
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:32,416
Oh yeah.

1738
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,500
Take it off. Slowly.

1739
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:38,958
Are you blind?

1740
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:40,500
I've been trying to call you for so long.

1741
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,833
"Rascals have kept her quite inside."

1742
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,500
Stupid.

1743
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,625
Sorry.

1744
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:50,625
Your Guddu is stupid.

1745
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:59,458
You're okay?

1746
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,083
Everything is going to be alright.

1747
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:11,125
Shall we go, Mr. Junior?

1748
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:15,125
Its better if we leave.

1749
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:23,083
We were having so much fun.

1750
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:28,625
Tomorrow after Happy leaves everything will become boring again.

1751
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:30,375
Right?

1752
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:33,416
You two can come to Amritsar whenever you like.

1753
01:37:33,916 --> 01:37:35,125
I'll take you around Amritsar.

1754
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:37,875
Right, Guddu. - And why Amritsar, We all should go to Shimla.

1755
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:38,958
It's a really amazing place.

1756
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:42,958
Mr. Bhatti, our travel agent will sort everything. - Yeah.

1757
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:49,625
Can your father kill someone? - Of course he can.

1758
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:51,583
Who do you want him to kill? - No one.

1759
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:54,416
Your father's here to kill Bilal's father.

1760
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:55,125
What?

1761
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:56,500
Father's here? - Yes.

1762
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,958
In Lahore? - Yes.

1763
01:37:58,458 --> 01:38:00,083
Not just father, Bagga's here too. - What?

1764
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:00,875
Yes.

1765
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,833
Bagga's in jail, but father's free.

1766
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:06,833
But what is my father doing here? - I don't know

1767
01:38:10,833 --> 01:38:12,625
Brother, it's confirmed.

1768
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:16,625
She ran away.

1769
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:33,708
Run Happy...run.

1770
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:37,708
I will find you again.

1771
01:38:56,750 --> 01:39:00,458
What happened? Huh!

1772
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:03,333
Nothing.

1773
01:39:03,833 --> 01:39:05,416
What's wrong, Bilal Ahmed?

1774
01:39:05,916 --> 01:39:10,041
Your walk has lost its confidence, your words are not sure of its meaning!

1775
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:14,250
You've spent half your life blaming your father.

1776
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:18,916
And you want to spend the rest blaming me?

1777
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:23,083
No, I don't want your favor.

1778
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:26,583
And if you're wondering what will happen to Zoya...

1779
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:29,416
...then let me clear that doubt as well.

1780
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:33,500
When you were selected for the College team...

1781
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,083
...I drank and danced all night.

1782
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:42,083
If you're happy with someone else, I'll still be doing that.

1783
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:53,666
I love you.

1784
01:39:56,458 --> 01:40:00,458
But it's my problem.

1785
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:05,083
The day you see tears in my eyes, Bilal Ahmed...

1786
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:08,500
...change my name.

1787
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,208
Madam.

1788
01:40:10,708 --> 01:40:14,708
That brother sent me.

1789
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:16,791
Why don't you keep something new?

1790
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:20,833
People get bored of seeing the same items every day.

1791
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,833
Right?

1792
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:38,083
"O kind soul...I thank you."

1793
01:40:38,583 --> 01:40:46,083
"O companion...I've fallen in love."

1794
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:50,083
"There's no cure for my ailment."

1795
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:54,458
"My God is my witness."

1796
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:58,666
"Now you must decide..."

1797
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:03,125
"If I don't live with you... then what's the point of living at all."

1798
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:10,625
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1799
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:11,500
"I am in love with..."

1800
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,500
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1801
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:40,125
"I was often unaware of things."

1802
01:41:40,625 --> 01:41:44,375
"My heart was never a poet."

1803
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:48,416
"You have decided my fate... otherwise..."

1804
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:52,500
"...I was never destined for any love."

1805
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,625
"It's all your grace..."

1806
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,750
"...that I've forsaken all faith and religion."

1807
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,833
"Keep doing it..."

1808
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:00,916
"Keep tormenting me some more."

1809
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:05,083
"I couldn't control my heart no matter how hard I tried."

1810
01:42:05,583 --> 01:42:09,208
"I just handed it over to you."

1811
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:13,833
"Whether you destroy it or save it."

1812
01:42:14,333 --> 01:42:18,250
"You can do as you wish with my love."

1813
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:23,625
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1814
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:27,625
"I am in love with..."

1815
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:42,083
"My heart's in a big dilemma."

1816
01:42:42,583 --> 01:42:46,250
"My desires are still being stubborn."

1817
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:50,375
"The world will be upset with me."

1818
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:54,416
"But who cares about the world."

1819
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:56,458
"And you will go home"

1820
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,500
"All we have is this moment."

1821
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,791
"It's not the destination..."

1822
01:43:01,291 --> 01:43:02,875
"...it's the journey that I love."

1823
01:43:03,375 --> 01:43:07,125
"The borders won't like..."

1824
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:11,125
"...when two vagabond heart become one."

1825
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:15,875
"I am a bird and you're a star."

1826
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:19,875
"I'll choose my sky and you choose yours."

1827
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:30,083
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1828
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:32,625
"I am in love with..."

1829
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:36,625
"You...you...you...only you...just you...yes you..."

1830
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:53,375
Have I said too much? No. Way too much.

1831
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:56,750
But you said the truth.

1832
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,333
I am going to drop Guddu to the hotel.

1833
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:01,041
Get some rest.

1834
01:44:01,541 --> 01:44:03,791
We need to get them married tomorrow...

1835
01:44:04,291 --> 01:44:07,083
...and I need you by my side.

1836
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:11,458
Because that's what I want.

1837
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:15,458
I love you.

1838
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:37,041
Bilal. Yes, father?

1839
01:44:37,541 --> 01:44:38,916
Is everything okay? What's the hurry?

1840
01:44:39,416 --> 01:44:40,416
Well, I am leaving for the venue.

1841
01:44:40,916 --> 01:44:43,125
It's my trial today, and if everything goes well...

1842
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:46,416
...it will change the history of Pakistan.

1843
01:44:46,916 --> 01:44:48,916
Father, I am running late. I'll see you there.

1844
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:52,916
Thanks.

1845
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:58,250
No, sir... - Leave me.

1846
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:00,250
No, sir... - You cannot go in.

1847
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,875
Mister-Mister!

1848
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:03,875
He's already gone.

1849
01:45:04,375 --> 01:45:06,041
You guys are unbelievable.

1850
01:45:06,541 --> 01:45:08,500
Stop. Stop.

1851
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,500
Follow that white car. Quickly.

1852
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:18,666
Yes, Afridi.

1853
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:24,208
Sir, I have very bad news for you. When have you ever given me good news?

1854
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:25,375
Wait!

1855
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:26,958
Mister.

1856
01:45:27,458 --> 01:45:29,083
Hold on.

1857
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:32,666
Overtake him. Come on.

1858
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:36,000
Why isn't he listening?

1859
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,416
What a strange man!

1860
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:41,333
It's unbelievable, Afridi. I was saying the same thing, sir.

1861
01:45:41,833 --> 01:45:42,166
It really is unbelievable.

1862
01:45:42,666 --> 01:45:45,250
Happy's father is following me.

1863
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:49,083
These bunch of Indians have created a stir all over Pakistan.

1864
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:50,125
The same thing has happened here.

1865
01:45:50,625 --> 01:45:51,500
Forget that.

1866
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,250
I am heading towards the park, to give him the slip.

1867
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:57,041
That fool's talking on the phone while driving.

1868
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:59,208
Mister... - Come there immediately and arrest him.

1869
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:02,333
Of course. What park, sir?

1870
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:03,791
I don't know, Afridi.

1871
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:07,208
It's close to my home. I get it. I get it.

1872
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:09,916
Amjad, drive to Shalimar Park.

1873
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:11,333
Stay on the line Sir

1874
01:46:11,833 --> 01:46:12,750
Old man can be dangerous.

1875
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,416
He's slipping away

1876
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:16,000
Drive faster

1877
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:20,000
Mister!

1878
01:46:25,875 --> 01:46:26,875
Stop!

1879
01:46:27,375 --> 01:46:28,666
Stop! Stop!

1880
01:46:29,166 --> 01:46:31,250
Mister! Mister!

1881
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:34,083
Here you go.

1882
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:35,416
Wait, mister.

1883
01:46:35,916 --> 01:46:39,416
Nobody listens in this country!

1884
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:56,541
Stop!

1885
01:46:57,041 --> 01:47:00,541
Stop-Stop!

1886
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:11,791
Hello. Hello, yes sir.

1887
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:13,208
I am in the park. Where are you?

1888
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:14,750
Congratulations, I am in the park as well.

1889
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,458
Sir, please take a look around you.

1890
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:20,000
How can anyone find you in this huge park with so many trees?

1891
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:23,125
Do you see the Cyprus trees? Cyprus?

1892
01:47:23,625 --> 01:47:26,666
What's Cyprus called in Urdu? It's called my head.

1893
01:47:27,166 --> 01:47:28,375
How did you join the police?

1894
01:47:28,875 --> 01:47:31,791
It's the same trees like the ones in front of the Taj Mahal.

1895
01:47:32,291 --> 01:47:32,500
Taj Mahal?

1896
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,708
Taj Mahal!

1897
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:35,875
I know...you haven't been there.

1898
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:37,000
You must have seen photos.

1899
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:38,250
Of course I did.

1900
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:39,458
I wish Taj Mahal was in Pakistan.

1901
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:41,291
Hey...that tree is right in front of me.

1902
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:45,291
Where...

1903
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,666
The old man's disappeared.

1904
01:47:49,166 --> 01:47:52,791
See, sir...I got here and the old man disappeared.

1905
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,458
I was getting worried, Mr. Junior.

1906
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:56,625
It's a good thing he ran away. What nice?

1907
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:58,791
The hoardings of the wedding are all over the city.

1908
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:01,958
If the old man gets there, it'll be a disaster.

1909
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:04,083
Disaster... exactly, even I was saying that.

1910
01:48:04,583 --> 01:48:05,250
What were you saying?

1911
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:07,875
There's a small problem, Mr. Junior.

1912
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:13,666
You see last night... Bagga ran away.

1913
01:48:14,166 --> 01:48:15,125
What?

1914
01:48:15,625 --> 01:48:17,375
Bagga escaped? When? How?

1915
01:48:17,875 --> 01:48:19,833
And you're telling me now? That is why called you, sir...

1916
01:48:20,333 --> 01:48:22,083
Shut up, Afridi.

1917
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:28,500
If Bagga gets there, then I will kill you instead.

1918
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,125
You get there.

1919
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:33,291
With Happy's deportation papers and Guddu's ticket. - Okay.

1920
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:35,458
Get the army, the police... everyone on the job!

1921
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:36,916
No one should get a whiff of this!

1922
01:48:37,416 --> 01:48:40,916
Just find Bagga.

1923
01:48:45,583 --> 01:48:49,625
Get the Army, the police... and no one should get a whiff of this. .

1924
01:48:50,125 --> 01:48:54,291
What kind of order was that?

1925
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:57,375
Shall we go?

1926
01:48:57,875 --> 01:49:01,375
You're looking nice.

1927
01:49:05,125 --> 01:49:08,750
Let's go.

1928
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:14,666
It'll happen this way, out here...I never imagined this.

1929
01:49:15,166 --> 01:49:19,083
But you...you won my heart, brother.

1930
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:23,416
You are amazing.

1931
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:28,208
You see Guddu, there's...been a small problem.

1932
01:49:28,708 --> 01:49:29,958
It's okay.

1933
01:49:30,458 --> 01:49:31,833
You cannot create problems.

1934
01:49:32,333 --> 01:49:34,083
You...

1935
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:40,666
I mean you have done it, brother.

1936
01:49:41,166 --> 01:49:44,666
You see...kind of...you know...

1937
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:50,250
Bagga escaped. I...

1938
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:51,083
What?

1939
01:49:51,583 --> 01:49:52,791
Bagga escaped!

1940
01:49:53,291 --> 01:49:55,375
Bagga escaped? How did he escape?

1941
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:59,500
And what do you mean kind of escaped? He must have fully escaped no?

1942
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,125
And if he's escaped, he'll get here.

1943
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:05,666
Brother, you have...

1944
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:09,666
You have done it!

1945
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:17,458
Superb. Beautiful.

1946
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:20,250
I am truly amazing. You?

1947
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:25,875
Yes, me...who did your makeup? Point.

1948
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:27,500
Thank you.

1949
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,250
No, thank you. What for?

1950
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,000
Bilal is right.

1951
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:36,583
You make everyone Like yourself... 'Happy'.

1952
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:39,250
That's why.

1953
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:42,291
Rifat. Yes.

1954
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:44,000
Don't say no.

1955
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:48,791
Gift this to Huriya on your behalf.

1956
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:51,750
If it were anyone else, I'd never accept it...

1957
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:54,416
..but whenever I see this necklace around Huriya's neck

1958
01:50:54,916 --> 01:50:57,208
I'll keep thinking of Happy

1959
01:50:57,708 --> 01:50:59,916
What are you saying, brother? I know Bagga.

1960
01:51:00,416 --> 01:51:01,000
He's a scoundrel.

1961
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,375
He's done things that you...

1962
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:03,875
I mean I've witnessed them. Greetings.

1963
01:51:04,375 --> 01:51:07,875
He's like a termite, eats you from inside. - Greetings.

1964
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:23,000
Happy. Yes.

1965
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:28,791
There's been a small problem. What?

1966
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:31,708
I... Bagga escaped.

1967
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:34,833
What? How did he escape?

1968
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:37,208
And you're saying it's a small problem.

1969
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:38,500
What are you doing?

1970
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:39,958
Shit!

1971
01:51:40,458 --> 01:51:41,375
Guddu, we have to go

1972
01:51:41,875 --> 01:51:42,166
We'll deal with this later.

1973
01:51:42,666 --> 01:51:46,166
We'll deal with this later. You wait, I'll deal with this later.

1974
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:49,166
Go there.

1975
01:51:49,666 --> 01:51:51,166
Greetings. How are you?

1976
01:51:51,666 --> 01:51:52,041
All okay.

1977
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:53,458
Greetings. Greetings.

1978
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:54,250
Come, son.

1979
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,958
Sir, please proceed towards the dais.

1980
01:51:56,458 --> 01:51:57,583
There's a security threat.

1981
01:51:58,083 --> 01:52:01,916
Security threats are nothing new for the members of Ahmed's family.

1982
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:03,041
You're right.

1983
01:52:03,541 --> 01:52:06,708
Ma'am. I've brought the priest.

1984
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:08,625
Priest, did you get everything?

1985
01:52:09,125 --> 01:52:11,458
I've brought everything, but I haven't done anything like this before.

1986
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:12,791
We haven't done anything like this either.

1987
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:13,750
Please take a seat.

1988
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:17,208
Sit sit...No one has done this in the history of Pakistan!

1989
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:18,625
Congratulations.

1990
01:52:19,125 --> 01:52:20,083
Congratulations.

1991
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:22,791
To you too!

1992
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:25,666
You're not needed inside. Stay here.

1993
01:52:26,166 --> 01:52:27,208
Congratulations.

1994
01:52:27,708 --> 01:52:30,208
And remember...don't let Bagga inside. Of course.

1995
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:34,208
Congratulations.

1996
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:48,291
Mister, can I meet these two gentlemen here?

1997
01:52:51,333 --> 01:52:53,500
Yes, mister. Of course. Go in.

1998
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,500
Father?

1999
01:53:08,083 --> 01:53:08,375
Where's Guddu?

2000
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:12,208
What are you doing here? Brother Usman, father was right here.

2001
01:53:12,708 --> 01:53:13,250
What do you mean? Old man.

2002
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,291
But he was with you. He left long ago.

2003
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:16,958
You want to get yourself killed.

2004
01:53:17,458 --> 01:53:18,750
Come on.

2005
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:22,750
Father was...

2006
01:53:37,125 --> 01:53:38,416
Why are so many people following father?

2007
01:53:38,916 --> 01:53:39,583
I don't know...you don't know...

2008
01:53:40,083 --> 01:53:43,583
What do you care?

2009
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,791
Where were you?

2010
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:49,916
Take a seat.

2011
01:53:50,416 --> 01:53:53,916
Take off, priest. Start.

2012
01:53:55,833 --> 01:53:56,083
Sir.

2013
01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:58,041
Sir. Sir. Sir. Mister.

2014
01:53:58,541 --> 01:54:00,625
Sir. Sir...he's the man I saw in the market.

2015
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:01,375
Catch him.

2016
01:54:01,875 --> 01:54:02,375
What's wrong?

2017
01:54:02,875 --> 01:54:07,500
I have come to meet Javed Ahmed.

2018
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,500
He must be around. Where else could he go?

2019
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,458
Guddu, Afridi

2020
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:20,666
Bagga's here!

2021
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:22,958
Who the hell fired a gun?

2022
01:54:23,458 --> 01:54:24,958
Scoundrel you've come too far!

2023
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:27,041
Brother you step aside, I'll take care of him.

2024
01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:27,875
You go get married...

2025
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:28,708
I will manage this.

2026
01:54:29,208 --> 01:54:31,125
Quickly.

2027
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:34,708
Priest, he's the real groom.

2028
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:36,791
Stay away.

2029
01:54:37,291 --> 01:54:38,208
Cover me.

2030
01:54:38,708 --> 01:54:42,208
Cover me. Cover me. - Cover me, also!

2031
01:54:45,416 --> 01:54:48,166
Happy you like running so much! Why are you slow today?

2032
01:54:48,666 --> 01:54:52,583
Faster!

2033
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:55,500
Hurry up, priest.

2034
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,833
Afridi, take these two to the airport.

2035
01:54:58,333 --> 01:54:58,875
And don't stop anywhere.

2036
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:01,666
Take them to the airport.

2037
01:55:02,166 --> 01:55:02,875
Hurry up, let's go!

2038
01:55:03,375 --> 01:55:06,500
It's done, it's done.

2039
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,500
Guddu! Happy! Greetings, father.

2040
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,875
Bless you! - He has a gun!

2041
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:14,250
Dear, hold up

2042
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:18,250
Rashid!

2043
01:55:20,458 --> 01:55:21,666
I'm here! You should escape..

2044
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:25,666
Dear.

2045
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,708
Mister...it's me. - Who is that? - Happy's father!

2046
01:55:31,208 --> 01:55:32,791
He doesn't listen at all.

2047
01:55:33,291 --> 01:55:35,375
Sir, the engine is on ...

2048
01:55:35,875 --> 01:55:39,375
Harpreet! This is unbelievable.

2049
01:55:49,583 --> 01:55:53,083
Get out of the way, moron!

2050
01:55:55,333 --> 01:55:57,708
Drive father, brother Usman. I am...don't worry.

2051
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:03,375
Bagga's right behind us. Let Bagga come, we're in Pakistan.

2052
01:56:03,875 --> 01:56:06,625
And Mr. Junior has complete faith in me.

2053
01:56:07,125 --> 01:56:09,291
Straight, keep driving straight brother!

2054
01:56:09,791 --> 01:56:10,166
Madam...

2055
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:11,125
Happy madam.

2056
01:56:11,625 --> 01:56:14,166
There's something I wanted to tell you.

2057
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:17,125
I'll always have a regret because of your love story.

2058
01:56:17,625 --> 01:56:19,500
I wish we had such love stories in Pakistan.

2059
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,166
But the truth is...your love story blossomed in Pakistan.

2060
01:56:23,666 --> 01:56:24,958
Brother, we haven't succeeded yes.

2061
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:26,583
Look ahead.

2062
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:31,375
It will. It will. It will. Drive faster.

2063
01:56:31,875 --> 01:56:33,375
Then I went to the tea-stall.

2064
01:56:33,875 --> 01:56:35,625
He gave me his address.

2065
01:56:36,125 --> 01:56:39,458
This guy in the white car.

2066
01:56:39,958 --> 01:56:44,083
Mister...hey mister, listen to me.

2067
01:56:44,583 --> 01:56:45,625
We'll go straight then take a turn...

2068
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:47,833
...and then take a left and then from the circle...

2069
01:56:48,333 --> 01:56:49,333
Why are you giving me directions?

2070
01:56:49,833 --> 01:56:51,083
I can see the car, you idiot!

2071
01:56:51,583 --> 01:56:54,375
It's me...I am from India, no one's ready to listen.

2072
01:56:54,875 --> 01:56:56,333
Brother, why take the same route as them?

2073
01:56:56,833 --> 01:56:58,500
They are all heading to the airport after all.

2074
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,083
Take a left. You're right.

2075
01:57:01,583 --> 01:57:02,250
Then take a left! Here?

2076
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:04,708
Yes...

2077
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:08,083
Bilal, Bagga turned left. Rascal, he's taking the shortcut.

2078
01:57:08,583 --> 01:57:09,500
Why aren't we taking the shortcut?

2079
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
We're not in a race, Zoya!

2080
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:14,166
Doesn't anyone hear you out in Pakistan?

2081
01:57:14,666 --> 01:57:17,500
What... - What's happening? - What's happening?

2082
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,208
You catch thieves in this.

2083
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:22,333
Cars don't usually breakdown in Pakistan!

2084
01:57:22,833 --> 01:57:24,166
Come on. Come on.

2085
01:57:24,666 --> 01:57:25,750
Stop her. Stop her. She will run away again.

2086
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:27,291
At least we'll reach before you.

2087
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:31,291
She'll run away!

2088
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:38,500
Hurry up.

2089
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,291
I said hurry up.

2090
01:57:41,791 --> 01:57:43,125
Here here.. Gate no.7

2091
01:57:43,625 --> 01:57:44,250
Stop the vehicle!

2092
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:46,083
Where do you think you're going?

2093
01:57:46,583 --> 01:57:47,250
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! - This is a high security area

2094
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:48,625
Stop-stop. We're here.

2095
01:57:49,125 --> 01:57:50,583
Sorry! Sorry! - Take this away...

2096
01:57:51,083 --> 01:57:53,958
Here, go now. No, brother Usman.

2097
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:56,000
We won't leave without meeting Bilal and Zoya.

2098
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:59,500
But Bagga...your father. We'll have to confront them in Amritsar.

2099
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:00,458
I am through with running away now.

2100
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:02,708
You guys... Mr. Junior will have me killed! - Happy.

2101
01:58:03,208 --> 01:58:04,750
Happy...

2102
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:10,250
Look, Happy... don't create a problem now.

2103
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:13,250
You're my wife now.

2104
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:15,708
You see...

2105
01:58:16,208 --> 01:58:21,625
...Bilal had started liking you. What?

2106
01:58:22,125 --> 01:58:25,708
Are you crazy? Be quiet and listen to me for once.

2107
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:27,958
I am only saying this because...

2108
01:58:28,458 --> 01:58:29,875
...I cannot take you back with this burden.

2109
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:31,791
I am not like that.

2110
01:58:32,291 --> 01:58:37,125
But he's...a great guy.

2111
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:41,125
Everything he did...

2112
01:58:43,625 --> 01:58:43,916
Harpreet!

2113
01:58:44,416 --> 01:58:44,708
Hey... Look!

2114
01:58:45,208 --> 01:58:46,750
Listen old man! - Happy...

2115
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:47,625
Take his gun.

2116
01:58:48,125 --> 01:58:49,125
Shut up, inspector.

2117
01:58:49,625 --> 01:58:50,791
What kind of a country is this?

2118
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:54,791
No one listens to you until you don't point a gun.

2119
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:02,291
I came to tell my daughter...

2120
01:59:02,791 --> 01:59:08,791
...that the guy I chose for her was completely wrong.

2121
01:59:09,291 --> 01:59:12,291
But the guy you chose...

2122
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:13,666
...he's right

2123
01:59:14,166 --> 01:59:17,666
I like him. Very good.

2124
01:59:24,583 --> 01:59:26,333
Love you, dad.

2125
01:59:26,833 --> 01:59:30,833
Wow! This is amazing!

2126
01:59:31,333 --> 01:59:32,250
Bless you.

2127
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:34,958
Give them your blessings and send them off.

2128
01:59:35,458 --> 01:59:38,958
We'll get you your bus tickets for tomorrow...

2129
01:59:50,208 --> 01:59:53,708
Thank you, Zoya.

2130
01:59:55,125 --> 01:59:57,500
Take care of yourself. You too.

2131
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,500
We'll miss you.

2132
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:27,416
And Mr. Bilal...you're supposed to be the next Jinnah, right?

2133
02:00:40,416 --> 02:00:44,958
Bilal, I'll take care of Madhubala.

2134
02:00:45,458 --> 02:00:48,208
And Usman bro, get your car fixed. Sure!

2135
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:51,083
Zoya, I love you too.

2136
02:00:51,583 --> 02:00:55,500
I love you.

2137
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,958
What's the big deal, sir?

2138
02:00:58,458 --> 02:01:01,375
Even Dilip Kumar couldn't get Madhubala.

2139
02:01:01,875 --> 02:01:04,166
He told you too?

2140
02:01:04,666 --> 02:01:08,916
All of Pakistan knows about it.

2141
02:01:09,416 --> 02:01:12,916
Come, Bilal.

2142
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:27,250
What was she whispering in your ears?

2143
02:01:38,125 --> 02:01:42,208
Let's go... -But Bagga!

2144
02:01:42,708 --> 02:01:46,791
And our brother has made a big name for Punjab even in Pakistan.

2145
02:01:47,291 --> 02:01:50,791
He's been victorious.

2146
02:01:53,791 --> 02:02:00,750
Well, I cannot take all the credit alone.

2147
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:09,083
I only went there to bring these two lovers back home safe and sound.

2148
02:02:09,583 --> 02:02:13,708
This isn't your brother's victory alone.

2149
02:02:14,208 --> 02:02:18,083
This is Happy's victory!

2150
02:02:18,583 --> 02:02:21,416
This is your victory!

2151
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:23,291
And this is Amritsar's victory.

2152
02:02:23,791 --> 02:02:27,291
Clap!

2153
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,083
Listen you fool... will they still vote for me?

2154
02:02:34,583 --> 02:02:36,625
Of course they will.

2155
02:02:37,125 --> 02:02:41,125
So what if Happy's got that goat, we've got the sympathy vote!
