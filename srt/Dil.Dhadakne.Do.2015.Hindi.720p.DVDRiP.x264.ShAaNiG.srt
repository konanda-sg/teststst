1
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,097
The world is filled
with all kinds of animals.

2
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,918
But the strangest species

3
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,004
is the human being.

4
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:22,564
Time just flows for
the rest of the creatures...

5
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:27,460
But human beings divide it into years,
months, days

6
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,269
and make calendars.

7
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:35,492
They claim you can't turn back time.

8
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:38,619
And they also say my
birthday has come again.

9
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:41,990
Whether time can turn back or not

10
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:45,502
all the special
occasions of human beings

11
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:48,171
take a u-turn and come back each year.

12
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:54,219
Which brings us to
these hampers being packed.

13
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:57,106
These are gifts as well as invitations

14
00:03:57,172 --> 00:04:00,242
for a 30th marriage anniversary.

15
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,338
The 30th happy anniversary of Mr.
and Mrs. Mehra.

16
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:07,635
One of Delhi society's
most popular couples -

17
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:09,549
The Mehras.

18
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,116
This is Mr. Kamal Mehra.

19
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,310
A successful businessman...

20
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:21,342
who built his mighty
empire from scratch.

21
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:27,595
A fact he repeats often,
incase anyone forgets it.

22
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:32,288
Mr. Mehra is referred
to as a self made man.

23
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:36,845
One wonders that if people
can make themselves...

24
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:38,823
then why don't they make
themselves a little better?

25
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:40,942
But what does one do?

26
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,855
These days, 'better' is not defined

27
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,181
by intelligence, honesty or courage

28
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:46,502
but by something else.

29
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:53,492
It has to do with
something called money.

30
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,371
Nice putt Kamal!

31
00:04:56,855 --> 00:05:00,126
If only you had been this
precise with the Suri deal.

32
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:02,556
You win some, you lose some, Lalit.

33
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,148
Only a man nearing
the end does accounts.

34
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:12,917
Come on!

35
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:13,965
Beer is on me.

36
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,042
I have a lunch date with my wife...

37
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,204
and I never keep a lady waiting.

38
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:19,316
See you.

39
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,111
This is his wife, Neelam Mehra.

40
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:33,082
Mr.Mehra is not having lunch with her,
she is just an excuse.

41
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,551
In fact, they have not
lunched together in years.

42
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,529
Their story was quite
romantic to begin with.

43
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:44,309
18 year old Neelam had run away

44
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,845
and married 22 year old Kamal.

45
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:51,015
Over time,
they found unbelievable success.

46
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:53,967
But lost each other along the way.

47
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:57,166
Anyway, this is just
inside information.

48
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:01,018
In front of the world,
theirs is a perfect marriage.

49
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,140
An ideal couple.

50
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:04,747
You know na Kamal was in Taiwan

51
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:06,412
last week for some work...

52
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:08,356
Guess who had a meeting

53
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:09,814
in Taiwan the same week?

54
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:10,891
Don't tell me!

55
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:11,834
Radhikal?

56
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:13,708
She's such a number!

57
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:15,415
And this Kamal...

58
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,049
why pack your pants

59
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,751
when you aren't going to wear them?!

60
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:24,934
We were just talking
about you & Kamal.

61
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:25,556
Really?

62
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:26,603
It's so sweet of him

63
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,990
to plan a cruise.

64
00:06:28,648 --> 00:06:29,667
My husband doesn't even

65
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,053
remember our anniversary.

66
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,151
How do you remember your husband?

67
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:39,810
My maid's run away again.

68
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,668
Again? What do you do with them?!

69
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:44,847
Yes, Ayesha?

70
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:47,000
Deeya aunty still hasn't confirmed...

71
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,231
I know, mom

72
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:51,379
but we can't keep the room on hold.

73
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:53,334
Nice card...

74
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,771
To celebrate 30 years
of Kamal and Neelam,

75
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:57,820
we wish you to join us

76
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,250
for a 10 day cruise
of Turkey and Greece.

77
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,497
Just like our lives, this journey

78
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:03,103
won't be the same without you.

79
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:05,110
Kabir Mehra.

80
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:12,027
Ayesha Mehra...

81
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:14,186
Neelam and Kamal's first born.

82
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:18,184
But her name is not on the
invite alongside her brother's.

83
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,158
Why would it be?

84
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:23,332
The tradition of our
nation is that after marriage

85
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,769
the daughter belongs
to another family.

86
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,058
The son could have umpteen marriages

87
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,068
he will always remain our own.

88
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,265
And so, 21 years after her birth,

89
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,953
Ayesha was married
and shipped off to Mumbai

90
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,653
to lead a life like all
girls in these circumstances.

91
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:46,689
But Ayesha is not typical
of the female ilk.

92
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,702
Soon after her wedding,

93
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:52,377
she started her business
- An online travel portal.

94
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,529
Today, she is the
2nd biggest in the market.

95
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,144
Just like her father,
she too is self made.

96
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:05,556
The difference is, she doesn't say it.

97
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,970
And here we have Kabir Mehra,

98
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:22,553
the youngest member
of the Mehra family.

99
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:27,346
The male child, or rather God's gift.

100
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,061
After all,
he will carry on the family name.

101
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:35,345
Just last week, he turned 25.

102
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,125
The apple of his mother's eye

103
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:41,352
and the sole heir
to his father's empire.

104
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:45,879
So we have a prince
and we have a throne.

105
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,279
But is that enough?

106
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,161
Only time will tell if this
prince is worthy of the throne or not.

107
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,189
And there you have it, folks.

108
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,527
I think it's sufficiently clear

109
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:03,534
that we can together deliver

110
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:04,851
a high quality product

111
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:05,994
for the South Asian market-

112
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,092
And how will you compete
with Chinese products?

113
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:11,840
Well I don't think

114
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:15,211
that is a concern for us.

115
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:17,466
After all, our quality is higher

116
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:18,133
and price lower.

117
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:20,077
These prices are only possible

118
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,023
if the production
costs and selling price

119
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:23,650
function on these numbers.

120
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:26,431
The Indian rupee keeps fluctuating.

121
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,423
Where is the contingency
plan for that?

122
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:32,276
If the dollar rises

123
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,373
raw material costs will also increase.

124
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:37,039
Isn't that right?

125
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,488
Actually, you are totally right

126
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:48,230
we should have factored that in.

127
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:51,283
You will get our revised
proposal by tomorrow.

128
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,263
You're right.

129
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:54,757
Anything can happen.

130
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,337
Don't you have elections
in Sri Lanka next year?

131
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,015
The policy could change

132
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:02,647
with a new government.

133
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,007
And then the tax concessions

134
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:05,885
you have committed to us

135
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:06,964
may also change.

136
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,155
We must factor that in too.

137
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:12,422
You're absolutely right, Mr. Mehra

138
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,470
As usual.

139
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:53,680
Oh my god!

140
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:54,857
I love that picture of Pluto

141
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,003
you put up yesterday.

142
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:57,364
Isn't it the best?

143
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:58,335
He's so cute.

144
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,420
What's Pluto?

145
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:00,765
It's a planet.

146
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:02,857
It was.

147
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,496
Was...

148
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:07,548
Pluto is our doggie.

149
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:08,690
Pluto is our brother.

150
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:09,836
Brother...

151
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:11,548
Does he look like you?

152
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,673
Why didn't anyone tell me

153
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,550
Manav's cousin is so cute?

154
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:20,542
When are you going
back to Delhi, Kabir?

155
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,419
Tomorrow, after the meeting.

156
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:27,808
Why?

157
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:29,374
What is the hurry?

158
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:30,659
Stay another day na.

159
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:32,293
Do you still ride that plane?

160
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:34,172
I even fly it now, Aunty.

161
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:36,775
You had promised me you'll come.

162
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:37,648
Then what happened?

163
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,789
How?

164
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:40,432
I have vertigo.

165
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:41,752
In any case...

166
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,448
if I leave for even a day

167
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:44,697
this house falls apart.

168
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,033
I heard

169
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:48,347
dad is selling the plane?

170
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,366
Yes...

171
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,082
Don't remind me.

172
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,505
I may jump off from here.

173
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,186
Ayesha, please work out a way

174
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,465
that he doesn't have to sell it.

175
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,645
Kabir!

176
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:02,354
I know this plane
is your one true love,

177
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:05,006
but Ayka needs an asset reduction.

178
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:05,977
It's a dead investment.

179
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:07,400
You know...

180
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,929
When I got married,

181
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:12,228
I was so shy in front of my in-laws.

182
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:14,417
Forget talking about business.

183
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:18,035
I could hardly say 'yes', 'no'.

184
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,513
But how times have changed...

185
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,719
Mom tell us that story,

186
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,975
when you met the Maharaja of Jodhpur.

187
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,369
You know...

188
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,620
Even Kabir felt my name

189
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,043
should have been on the card.

190
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:33,398
Aysh...

191
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,026
The invitation was from the Mehras.

192
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:36,564
You're not a Mehra anymore.

193
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:37,739
You are a Sangha.

194
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:43,860
And please tell Kabir...

195
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:45,593
how was he behaving with Nitya?

196
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:47,513
They are not kids.

197
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:48,034
I know.

198
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,147
But she is my cousin

199
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,183
and your brother...

200
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,345
spoilt brat!

201
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:59,223
Brat or not, Kabir is my best friend.

202
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:01,546
We met 5 years ago

203
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:03,778
and have been inseparable since.

204
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:07,808
Oh great...
I forgot to introduce myself.

205
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,975
After all,
even I belong to this family.

206
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:13,298
Hello, handsome!

207
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,874
And at the risk of sounding impolite

208
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:18,691
if anyone in this family is normal,

209
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:19,905
it is me...

210
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,397
Pluto Mehra.

211
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:25,986
Ayesha is upset

212
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:27,968
her name was not on the card.

213
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:31,442
How was your meeting?

214
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:34,079
Papa did everything on Skype.

215
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:35,405
Awww

216
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,218
How modest my baby is!

217
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,060
Just like Mama.

218
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,676
I don't think Ayka needs me.

219
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,075
What do you mean?

220
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:52,709
The company is for you.

221
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:53,653
You're our son...

222
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:55,455
who else will manage it?

223
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,394
I don't know.

224
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:59,598
Maybe Papa can find
someone more qualified.

225
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,194
What is the matter?

226
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,591
Here.

227
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:09,535
It's diet.

228
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,094
There is no such thing

229
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:12,034
don't lie.

230
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,606
You want cheese toast?

231
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:16,033
Hot chocolate fudge from Nirula's?

232
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:17,733
Are you even listening to me?

233
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:27,743
I don't think I belong here.

234
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,740
If you didn't belong here

235
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:36,646
why would you be born here?

236
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:41,061
This 'mummy' logic na...

237
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:42,691
Okay...

238
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,880
If you could wish for

239
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,089
one thing right now

240
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,754
what would it be?

241
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:49,570
Anything.

242
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,639
Anything, tell me?

243
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,521
I wish dad wasn't selling the plane.

244
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,359
It's so oily.

245
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:17,346
How can anyone eat this?

246
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,573
What else is there?

247
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:20,643
Just this.

248
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:21,661
Just this?

249
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:22,803
Great.

250
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:23,530
Thank you.

251
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,342
<i>Sun“!</i>

252
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,386
Yes, sir?

253
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,426
Get some fruit.

254
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,304
I've told you to
tell them in the morning

255
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:35,354
what you want to eat.

256
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:37,866
It's not just about me.

257
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,748
You think you should be eating this?

258
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:42,732
Good luck with your weight loss.

259
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:46,969
Pass the yoghurt.

260
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:57,609
Ayesha is upset

261
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,513
her name is not on the card.

262
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,223
Oh ya?

263
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,345
She did all the planning, not me.

264
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:06,715
If we put Ayesha's name on the card

265
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:07,821
then we'll have to put Manav's as well

266
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,932
and then everyone will think

267
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:10,921
he is paying for the cruise.

268
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,139
It's confusing.

269
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,077
I told you she'd be upset.

270
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:19,679
Then talk to her...

271
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:20,756
Mother India.

272
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:22,354
Guys please.

273
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:39,177
I am selling some of my shares.

274
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:40,982
What?

275
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,377
I need to buy something.

276
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,368
Oh really!

277
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,243
Those Louis Vuitton bags

278
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,490
and shoes aren't enough?

279
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,747
Now you need to own their company?

280
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,738
I want to buy my son a gift

281
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:53,637
if you don't mind?!

282
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:54,781
What gift?

283
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:56,589
The plane you are selling.

284
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:57,527
Mom!

285
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,681
Have you no shame?

286
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:04,965
I didn't say anything.

287
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,978
What's wrong with you, Kabir?

288
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,330
Just leave him out of this.

289
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:08,615
At your age

290
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,251
I used to take a bus to work.

291
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,126
On foot, when I had no money.

292
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,253
The soles of my shoes would wear out!

293
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,910
I've worked very hard, Kabir-

294
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,728
Really? Then?

295
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:20,395
We've never heard this story before.

296
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,107
And you?

297
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,608
You want to buy our plane from us?

298
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,423
You are a genius, Neelam.

299
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:28,842
They are my shares.

300
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:31,867
I'll do what I want
with my money, okay.

301
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:32,915
Your money?

302
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,717
You only have this money

303
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:35,725
because I earned it.

304
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,556
Me!

305
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:37,845
And I supported you.

306
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,304
Shut up okay.

307
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,661
Don't talk to me like this.

308
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:46,600
Human beings are
blessed with language.

309
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:51,925
İt is a gift that enables
them to clearly express

310
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,818
their thoughts, ideas and emotions.

311
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:02,595
But the irony is that
in spite of this power,

312
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:05,241
the acute lack of
understanding between them,

313
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,254
will not be found in mute animals.

314
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,196
If there can be so much
misunderstanding in one nuclear family,

315
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:18,681
how can one even hope for world peace?

316
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,407
What is this, Amrish?

317
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,571
If I hadn't come for a random check

318
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,217
you would've shipped these off?

319
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:31,757
Is this Ayka's finish?

320
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:32,835
You're the supervisor.

321
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,046
Is this how you supervise?

322
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:35,892
Bhai saab...

323
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,660
I heard from the bank.

324
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:43,079
Bad news.

325
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,714
They are not willing
to take any more risks.

326
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:45,932
The account is already overdrawn.

327
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:48,990
And everyone we owe
money to is calling.

328
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,084
Shit.

329
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,064
How can they do this?

330
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:56,607
25 years we've been
working with them...

331
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:58,897
This is how they
value our relationship?

332
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,535
What do they want?

333
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:01,858
Should I put up a hoarding?

334
00:20:02,614 --> 00:20:04,048
That Ayka is bankrupt!

335
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:07,759
I can delay it.

336
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:10,054
But we'll have to pay up.

337
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:11,069
What to do...

338
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:32,342
Everything is okay...

339
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,041
I am okay.

340
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:35,427
I am okay.

341
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:39,183
Oh, Kamal will be so upset.

342
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:42,202
We'll miss you guys...

343
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:45,197
I'll tell him.

344
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:46,516
Okay.

345
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,279
Bye...

346
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:48,320
Bye...

347
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:52,013
The Kumars are not coming.

348
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:52,843
Good.

349
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,618
8,000 Euros saved.

350
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:00,310
Do you have to be so crude?

351
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:03,305
The company is bleeding.

352
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:06,324
Interest is mounting by the day.

353
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,809
So forgive me for being crude.

354
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:24,267
Prem thinks I should talk to Lalit.

355
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:27,918
Lalit Sood?

356
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,107
You're selling shares?

357
00:21:32,113 --> 00:21:33,131
For partnership?

358
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,457
49%.

359
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:40,846
He has deep pockets.

360
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:43,898
You have to be at an advantage

361
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,671
with a man like Lalit.

362
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:49,007
Give him something he needs...

363
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:50,926
But what?

364
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,942
That bastard has everything.

365
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,036
Except a son-in-law.

366
00:21:58,771 --> 00:21:59,885
His daughter Noorie...

367
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:00,967
Her engagement broke up.

368
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:01,867
I told you.

369
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:03,577
Why, what did she do?

370
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:04,930
Who cares!

371
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:07,496
She is Lalit Sood's only heir.

372
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:11,879
Does Kabir know her?

373
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:14,417
They must have met socially.

374
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,135
What are you thinking?

375
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:29,393
Kabir and Noorie?

376
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:35,335
No, actually...

377
00:22:35,614 --> 00:22:36,692
It's not a bad idea.

378
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:41,322
Anyway Naina Sood must be

379
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:43,053
quite desperate these days.

380
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,190
Should I invite them?

381
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,508
What about Vinod?

382
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:54,001
If we call them

383
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,396
Vinod will get upset.

384
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:57,829
Don't worry about him...

385
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:00,231
He survived a heart attack.

386
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,891
He'll live through this too.

387
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:06,555
Hi Naina!

388
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:08,156
How are you?

389
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,574
Very well...

390
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,218
Okay, I've called to invite you...

391
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:13,891
It's our wedding anniversary

392
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:15,201
and we are going for a cruise.

393
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,409
And we'd love you all to join us.

394
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,970
Ayesha Didi!

395
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,152
Coming!

396
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:28,444
Welcome!

397
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:29,493
Hello, darling!

398
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,102
Hi, Saira Aunty!

399
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:32,590
Hey boy!

400
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:48,918
Come on!

401
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,135
Pluto Mehra.

402
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:12,102
Come to me...

403
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,839
Why is he on the leash?

404
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,198
Ship rules...

405
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:16,174
Poor Pluto!

406
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,877
Great show Kabir.

407
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,103
Congratulate Ayesha, Jamaal uncle.

408
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,391
It's all her doing.

409
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,132
Your sister is a genius...

410
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,644
Forbes magazine's
top 10 entrepreneurs.

411
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:30,902
Congratulations, Kamal.

412
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:33,757
Next year it'll be my son.

413
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:37,718
He just cracked an
incredible deal in Mumbai.

414
00:24:37,783 --> 00:24:39,004
You should have seen him, Jamaal...

415
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:40,877
He was a tiger!

416
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:41,681
Really?

417
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,418
Good job, Kabir.

418
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:44,255
Proud of you!

419
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:48,983
You have completely forgotten
Delhi and all of us.

420
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,680
Not at all, Amrish uncle!

421
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,258
You must come more often.

422
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,197
Of course I will.

423
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:55,939
But I'm really happy
that you are here.

424
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,793
Kamal Ji personally
invited Sunny & me.

425
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:01,110
I had to come.

426
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:03,577
I hope Sunny comes too.

427
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:06,254
How many change of
clothes have you brought?

428
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:08,867
Should be enough no?

429
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:10,396
The Chaddhas are upset

430
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:11,996
they were not invited.

431
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,619
Aren't they your friends lndu?

432
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,541
Everyone can't be invited.

433
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,677
They invited the dog.

434
00:25:16,746 --> 00:25:18,666
He is better behaved than the Chaddas.

435
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,309
Naina! Hello!

436
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:22,352
Oh my god!

437
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:24,640
So glad you all could make it.

438
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:26,830
What are they doing here?

439
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:29,574
Welcome aboard, Lalit.

440
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:32,392
This is amazing, Kamal.

441
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,435
Impressive.

442
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:34,750
Hello, Kamal.

443
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,046
How are you?

444
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:37,090
Top of the world, as usual.

445
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:37,920
Noorie!

446
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:41,364
She was so little when I last saw her.

447
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:42,642
Right, Neelu?

448
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,824
Come let's have a drink.

449
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:44,804
I'll just join you in a second...

450
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:46,334
Come come... Please come...

451
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:48,967
It's not easy.

452
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,118
But he'll learn.

453
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:51,019
Prem...

454
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,168
Listen...

455
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:54,725
Lalit Sood is here.

456
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,770
Give him the best suite.

457
00:25:57,495 --> 00:25:58,407
These should be no issues.

458
00:25:58,468 --> 00:25:59,416
No screw ups, okay?

459
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:01,946
What are you waiting for?

460
00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:02,713
Go!

461
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,610
What is this, Papa?

462
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:08,551
Why do you talk to
Prem uncle in this tone?

463
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:10,668
He's your brother, not your assistant.

464
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:12,832
Don't be silly.

465
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,014
I think you need a drink.

466
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:15,335
Come.

467
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:17,559
We all were worried about you.

468
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:19,259
Good to see you back in action, Sir.

469
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:21,206
It's god's grace

470
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:22,668
that I got luckys.

471
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:25,475
You never know with the heart.

472
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:27,353
I just got an ECG done.

473
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,049
Where did you do it?

474
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:28,993
In Bombay.

475
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,661
Let me know if you ever need a bypass.

476
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:32,886
Very good-.

477
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:35,763
Did you know Kamal
had invited the Soods?

478
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:36,883
Soods?

479
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:49,569
They say dogs have
a strong sense of smell.

480
00:26:50,812 --> 00:26:52,898
But when it comes
to sniffing out trouble,

481
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:55,122
humans aren't far behind.

482
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:03,057
Not only do they anticipate
danger in advance,

483
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,863
they even plan their response to it.

484
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:11,329
Ironically,
the biggest threat to a human being

485
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:13,131
is another human being.

486
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,873
To shield themselves,

487
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:19,046
they change their colour
to suit their environment.

488
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:24,777
And they become a bit like chameleons.

489
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:27,247
For instance,

490
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:31,895
Vinod Khanna and Lalit
Sood are shaking hands.

491
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:37,154
When in reality,
it is a show of strength.

492
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:42,878
Their wives are exchanging smiles

493
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:47,155
but it is a baring of fangs.

494
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:51,325
Their children have been
instructed to keep a distance,

495
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:56,020
but are actually sizing each other up.

496
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:02,451
Pretension is a purely human trait.

497
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,968
When others do it,
people call it hypocrisy.

498
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:11,935
And when they do it themselves,
they call it worldliness.

499
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,755
So all I can say is

500
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,241
that Mr. and Mrs.
Mehra are very worldly people.

501
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:32,972
Attention attention...

502
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:37,623
Today, all of you...

503
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,165
my dear friends...

504
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:42,247
are here tonight...

505
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:44,156
What can I say.

506
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:49,129
I feel on top of the world!

507
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:56,707
Neelu, my beautiful wife...

508
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,041
When I first met you,

509
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:01,190
I was nothing.

510
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:04,079
And even today, without you

511
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:05,916
I'd be nothing.

512
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:09,017
I can't say it enough...

513
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:11,058
I love you, Neelu.

514
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:12,491
Go for it!

515
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,056
That's my buddy!

516
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:18,115
Touch wood, Vinod.

517
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,547
God has been very kind.

518
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:23,574
Our only wish is that

519
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:25,933
our daughter...

520
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,786
and our son-in-law...

521
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:35,150
quickly give us a grandson!

522
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:41,265
Cheers to that!

523
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:42,585
Cheers!

524
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:44,428
Come on lets have dinner!

525
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,937
You know Vinod just
had a heart attack.

526
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:48,501
I know...

527
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,994
If we knew the Soods are coming

528
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:51,036
we wouldn't come.

529
00:29:51,478 --> 00:29:54,085
Vandana aunty,
it must've slipped Mama's mind...

530
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:55,407
How?!

531
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:58,082
Everyone knows our
equation with the Soods.

532
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,589
Vinod can't stand Lalit Sood.

533
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:02,083
Mom please take it easy...

534
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,576
They're standing right here.

535
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:03,548
Rana, please!

536
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:05,208
Neelu should've told us.

537
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:06,320
Now what have I done?

538
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:08,688
You could've made a little
more effort at your outfit.

539
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:09,702
I did.

540
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,539
It's not a big deal...

541
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:13,700
I don't get involved
in making these guest lists.

542
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:14,907
Neelam looks into all that.

543
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:15,922
Kamal...

544
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:17,831
Don't be formals.

545
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:22,033
We've been tolerating
our wives for so many years.

546
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,883
We can tolerate the Soods for 2 weeks!

547
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,323
C'mon man!

548
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:28,401
It's your anniversarys...

549
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,372
Cheers!

550
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:32,850
Come on Smita Ji,
you must have a drink!

551
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:34,160
Shall I get you a drink?

552
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,874
I have arthritis.

553
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:38,374
I can't hold the glass for too long.

554
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,940
I'll help you.

555
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:43,033
I love this Neelam Aunty.

556
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,243
This is so stunning!

557
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,186
Thank you!

558
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:47,027
My anniversary gift.

559
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:47,997
Wow!

560
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:49,283
Have you met Kabir?

561
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:50,190
Yes.

562
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:51,893
Kabir!

563
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:53,422
Come here, son.

564
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:58,396
Have you met Noorie?

565
00:30:58,455 --> 00:30:59,641
Yes... Hi.

566
00:30:59,706 --> 00:31:00,477
Hi...

567
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,491
Now she's your responsibility...

568
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,748
Have fun.

569
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:05,028
Thank you.

570
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:13,827
So what's been up?

571
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,303
What's been up?

572
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:21,613
My fianc left me at the altar.

573
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:24,356
Everyone is laughing at my family

574
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:26,545
and my mom blames me.

575
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,595
But you already knew this?

576
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:31,690
No.

577
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:38,051
My fianc Jai went to Goa-

578
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:40,627
Ex-fiance...

579
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,301
Ex-fiance, Jai...

580
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:47,503
went to Goa for his bachelor trip.

581
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,697
There he met a hippie, fell in love

582
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,748
and that was that.

583
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,252
That's rough.

584
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,668
İt was in the front
page of the Delhi Times.

585
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:02,140
Headlines...

586
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,539
Noorie Sood...

587
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,320
"Not so Hippie!"

588
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,339
That boy Jai has
turned us into a joke...

589
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:30,398
That's just how people are.

590
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,995
Look at some of my own friends...

591
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,513
They love discussing
other peoples' problems.

592
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,347
I'm having a 'Mata
ki Chowki' next month.

593
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,608
God's given us just one daughter...

594
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,733
Atleast now he should be kind.

595
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:50,795
He was being kind.

596
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:52,878
Let me tell you Naina...

597
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,604
Noorie is meant to
find a better boy than Jai.

598
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:58,647
Believe me.

599
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:04,391
Dinner was great, haan?

600
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:05,909
Did you try the prawns?

601
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:08,453
They were fantastic!

602
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:20,159
Did you notice...

603
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:22,943
Noorie and Kabir were really bonding.

604
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:28,720
Did Naina say anything to you?

605
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:30,239
Relax...

606
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:31,873
It's just been a day.

607
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:33,372
Yes.

608
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:35,734
Just one day...

609
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,831
But it's been 30 years for us.

610
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:53,214
How time has flown...

611
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,903
Why are you acting?

612
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:58,883
No one is watching.

613
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:05,414
Okay...

614
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:30,132
Everyone is saying how
well you planned this cruise.

615
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:32,144
Congratulations.

616
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,794
Your name should've been on that card.

617
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:42,681
Why don't you ever say anything?

618
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:44,312
Please...

619
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:49,629
Just order yourself another one...

620
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,020
Why do you always eat from my bowl?

621
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,269
Because you always get so irritated.

622
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,729
Makes it more tasty!

623
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:57,242
By the way"-

624
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,375
Jamaal uncle is super impressed
with your Forbes article.

625
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,552
Really Aysh...

626
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,446
What you have done
with your company...

627
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:12,601
I could never do it.

628
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,171
Of course you can.

629
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:17,017
And anyway...

630
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,704
no one except Jamaal
Uncle cares what I do.

631
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:23,269
Everyone just wants me to have a baby.

632
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,186
Ya, so that will happen too.

633
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:32,378
It won't...

634
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:34,743
I'm on the pill.

635
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:38,539
If you tell anyone I
swear to god I'll kill you.

636
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:39,579
You know that right?

637
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:41,973
Manav doesn't know?

638
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:49,241
Big man!

639
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:50,416
Hello, Kabir...

640
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,274
<i>U“!</i>

641
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:55,523
Look where your dog is sitting.

642
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,689
Pluto shoo...

643
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:00,497
Shoo...

644
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,801
Shoo...

645
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:06,610
Pluto off.

646
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,051
C'mon... Let's go for a swim.

647
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:10,677
How can you allow him on the bed?

648
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,774
It's disgusting...

649
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,195
Bye, Kabir.

650
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,246
Look at this dog hair...

651
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,581
We are living in a kennel.

652
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,203
Here we go...

653
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,265
A new story begins.

654
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:46,989
This is called love at first sight.

655
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:57,389
What is love at first sight?

656
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,518
You see someone,

657
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:03,745
a chemical reaction
is triggered in the brain,

658
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:07,360
blood rushes faster through the veins,

659
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:10,211
a tingling sensation
passes through the body...

660
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,308
So your heartbeat increases.

661
00:38:14,203 --> 00:38:15,839
It's not visible,

662
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:19,497
but the two of them are
experiencing all this right now.

663
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,527
Look at that...

664
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,231
When he comes here,

665
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:38,694
she goes there.

666
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:41,889
Even we play such
games in the beginning.

667
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:54,891
At the start of a new love story,

668
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,847
one doesn't really need speech...

669
00:38:58,497 --> 00:38:59,896
The eyes talk...

670
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,611
The body communicates.

671
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:08,655
Neither you nor I heard a thing,

672
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,949
but these two just had a conversation.

673
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:16,616
Good Morning!
This is your Captain speaking.

674
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:18,275
We are approaching the port of Izmir

675
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:20,891
and as predicted we
shall arrive at 9 am...

676
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:28,077
Please...

677
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:28,807
Oh no, please!

678
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:29,403
Go ahead.

679
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,929
You were here first...

680
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:35,763
Thank you.

681
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,702
You're welcome.

682
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:40,947
This Rana Khanna is so smart...

683
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:48,208
What are you are wearing?!

684
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:52,133
I just woke up.

685
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:54,424
So? This is not your bedroom!

686
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,165
Look at Noorie...

687
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,148
You want me to dress like Noorie?

688
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,257
If you don't doll up,
how will you trap a nice boy?

689
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:13,161
That's what girls
your age are meant to do.

690
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:15,280
What did she say?

691
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:29,984
Such a lovely colour you're wearing...

692
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:34,707
Listen, there's an authentic
Turkish Hamam here.

693
00:40:34,774 --> 00:40:35,889
Do you want to come with us?

694
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:36,453
No.

695
00:40:36,964 --> 00:40:37,982
I have asthma.

696
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:40,128
The steam makes
me...

697
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:41,975
I can't.

698
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:45,731
She even has asthma...

699
00:40:52,604 --> 00:40:54,039
Now that college is over, Divya

700
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,662
what is your career plan?

701
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:56,882
I don't know...

702
00:40:56,949 --> 00:40:58,655
I like some things, but...

703
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,879
Like what?

704
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:01,756
You like to sleep.

705
00:41:01,953 --> 00:41:03,518
You could become a coma patient.

706
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:07,072
Hello, girls!

707
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:08,280
Sorry!

708
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,411
I need to borrow your
sister for a minute...

709
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:14,404
What happened?

710
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,153
Saira Aunty just told
me Amira is pregnant.

711
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,902
That's great!

712
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:22,774
<i>R's NF...</i>

713
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,131
We should also try it.

714
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,288
Speak to Saira aunty.

715
00:41:26,874 --> 00:41:27,822
Let's meet Amira's doctor

716
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,281
as soon as we go back.

717
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:34,072
Okay?

718
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:34,696
Yes.

719
00:41:36,398 --> 00:41:37,654
We have to do this Aysh.

720
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:39,704
Yes...Okay.

721
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,383
Mama.

722
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:08,136
Why didn't you divorce Papa?

723
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:12,341
What kind of question is this?

724
00:42:17,897 --> 00:42:18,596
Look...

725
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,025
I know what all he's done.

726
00:42:23,494 --> 00:42:25,200
Every marriage has problems.

727
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:29,446
If not an affair,
then something else...

728
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,734
Doesn't mean you throw up your hands

729
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,130
and leave.

730
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,630
But why not?

731
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,245
Because that is too easy.

732
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,900
Staying together and
solving problems is difficult,

733
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:45,530
But also the right thing to do.

734
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,303
Marriage is not a
race you have to finish.

735
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:53,280
If someone is not
happy then why can't-

736
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:54,605
What is the matter with you?

737
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:57,946
Did you have a fight with Manav?

738
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:02,813
Not a fight, but we aren't-

739
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:04,094
Ayesha, I don't want to hear it!

740
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:06,835
Manav is a good man.

741
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:08,303
He's doing very well for himself.

742
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,530
You'll always have
everything you want.

743
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:14,875
Have everything I want?

744
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:18,409
If that's the case why didn't you

745
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:19,806
marry me off to a mall?

746
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,476
Have you gone crazy?

747
00:43:25,778 --> 00:43:27,141
Just because your
company is doing well

748
00:43:27,968 --> 00:43:29,402
don't let it go to your head.

749
00:43:32,555 --> 00:43:33,954
Forget about your career,

750
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:35,416
focus on your home.

751
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:49,257
We animals also train our young.

752
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,828
A lioness teaches her cubs to hunt.

753
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,846
A pigeon teaches her squabs to fly.

754
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:56,281
But once they've grown up,

755
00:43:56,585 --> 00:43:59,406
they are on their own.

756
00:44:00,444 --> 00:44:03,549
Indian parents somehow can't accept

757
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,979
that their offspring
are capable enough

758
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,331
to live life on their own terms.

759
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:08,790
Kabir.

760
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:09,483
Yes.

761
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,061
I've booked a table at
the night club for you kids.

762
00:44:12,122 --> 00:44:13,070
Sweet.

763
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:15,737
Please invite Noorie also.

764
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:17,484
Please.

765
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:23,871
They remain involved
in their children's lives

766
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,132
way longer than required.

767
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:27,770
Are you going like this

768
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,982
or will you wear some clothes?

769
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:30,032
Where is your jacket?

770
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:36,148
If one thinks wearing a
jacket will solve the problem,

771
00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:37,330
they are sadly mistaken.

772
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,433
Take off your jacket.

773
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:41,291
Mom, please!

774
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:42,539
What please?

775
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:45,946
Atleast wear some lipstick.

776
00:44:46,357 --> 00:44:48,443
Wanted or not,

777
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:51,926
the training never stops.

778
00:44:52,718 --> 00:44:54,282
Stay away from Lalit Sood's daughter.

779
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:55,614
Understood?

780
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,842
No need for hi, hellos.

781
00:44:59,148 --> 00:44:59,503
Dad...

782
00:44:59,774 --> 00:45:00,995
Cheers!

783
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:03,709
But can a leopard change his spots?

784
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,567
Do what you want, the kids today

785
00:45:08,116 --> 00:45:09,585
will follow their own instinct.

786
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:40,720
Shining girls,

787
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:42,873
these sparkling girls

788
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:45,419
The ones you are mad about too

789
00:45:46,904 --> 00:45:48,718
Funny girls,

790
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,525
these happy girls

791
00:45:50,797 --> 00:45:52,540
What is it they want to do

792
00:45:53,682 --> 00:45:55,081
What do they have in their heart

793
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:56,743
What hides in it's beat

794
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,803
What is that dream in their eyes

795
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:01,954
What does their soul need

796
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:03,659
I hear my body talk to me

797
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,790
Somersault,
shake it all, boogey and shimmy

798
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:09,674
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

799
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,340
I hear my body talk to me

800
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:13,494
Somersault,
shake it all, boogey and shimmy

801
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:17,363
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

802
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,164
Girls like to swing...

803
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,030
SWING...

804
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,424
from a little ahead

805
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:21,807
SWING...

806
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:23,334
try a new colour instead

807
00:46:23,399 --> 00:46:23,754
SWING...

808
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:24,859
your swag'll knock em dead!

809
00:46:24,928 --> 00:46:27,014
So don't you hesitate at all

810
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:27,754
SWING...

811
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:28,999
Just live it up

812
00:46:29,065 --> 00:46:29,693
SWING...

813
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:30,945
the juice of life, drink up

814
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:31,639
SWING...

815
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:32,856
that's my girl, chin up

816
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,878
So don't you shy away at all

817
00:46:59,824 --> 00:47:01,779
Every second's a celebration

818
00:47:01,841 --> 00:47:03,441
A rain of songs & jubilation

819
00:47:03,926 --> 00:47:06,889
Each moment, life's singing to me...

820
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,046
My body seems to melt away

821
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:11,129
My heart seems to lose it's way

822
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:15,570
A sweetness seems to be attracting me

823
00:47:16,821 --> 00:47:19,369
I feel a quivering inside

824
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:21,830
A sensation arise

825
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:25,070
As though every breath I take

826
00:47:25,127 --> 00:47:27,948
intoxicates with something it hides

827
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:29,553
I hear my body talk to me

828
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,633
Somersault,
shake it all, boogey and shimmy

829
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:35,496
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

830
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:37,119
I hear my body talk to me

831
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,216
Somersault,
shake it all, boogey and shimmy

832
00:47:39,343 --> 00:47:42,957
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

833
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:44,874
Girls like to swing...

834
00:47:45,148 --> 00:47:45,776

835
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:47,064

SWING...

837
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:49,015
try a new colour instead

838
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:49,703
SWING...

839
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,812
your swag'll knock em dead!

840
00:47:50,882 --> 00:47:52,838
So don't you hesitate at all

So don't you shy away at all

848
00:48:10,694 --> 00:48:11,736
Who was that guy?

849
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:13,614
Which guy?

850
00:48:23,936 --> 00:48:24,529
Hi!

851
00:48:25,187 --> 00:48:26,657
Hi!!!

852
00:48:29,497 --> 00:48:30,540
You were amazing!

853
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:32,041
Thank you!

854
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:37,078
No of fence ladies,

855
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:38,294
but...

856
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:40,829
Would you like to go out

857
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:41,941
for a drink or dinner

858
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:42,816
maybe?

859
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:44,209
Maybe.

860
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,585
So should I wait or...

861
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:50,705
UP to you.

862
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:57,690
Bye.

863
00:48:57,754 --> 00:48:59,674
Bye!

864
00:49:37,134 --> 00:49:39,125
...it takes a tigress to find a tiger-

865
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,027
Kabir!

866
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:41,549
Kabir, man...

867
00:49:41,618 --> 00:49:43,158
I was sleeping, these guys woke me up.

868
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:44,436
You can sleep when you're dead.

869
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:45,618
Hey! I thought the champagne

870
00:49:45,684 --> 00:49:46,668
was coming this way.

871
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:48,576
Hold on! It's coming.

872
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:53,352
Here.

873
00:49:54,352 --> 00:49:55,608
Oh no... That's okay.

874
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:56,479
What do you mean it's okay?

875
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:57,312
You'll fall sick.

876
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,253
No really...

877
00:49:58,349 --> 00:49:59,226
that's okay...

878
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:02,317
Anyway I wouldn't wear
this grandfather jacket.

879
00:50:02,764 --> 00:50:05,134
Did she just say 'grandfather jacket'?

880
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:07,909
Noorie, you're a star!

881
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:09,924
Speaking of stars...

882
00:50:10,827 --> 00:50:12,463
Does anyone know any Nakshatras?

883
00:50:13,503 --> 00:50:16,253
Dude, what's a Nakshastra?

884
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:17,333
Constellation.

885
00:50:17,396 --> 00:50:18,167
Look...

886
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,214
Centaurus.

887
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:21,193
It's half man, half horse.

888
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:22,546
It has eleven stars...

889
00:50:22,783 --> 00:50:24,976
1, 2, 3, 4...

890
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:26,022
I can't see anything.

891
00:50:26,294 --> 00:50:27,929
And then you see
the legs coming down...

892
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,147
Can you see the shape?

893
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,622
Ptolemy discovered it.

894
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:33,117
It's from Greek mythology.

895
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:34,254
I'm bored...

896
00:50:38,146 --> 00:50:40,231
Yuck-ni pulao!

897
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,293
Some warning would have been nice...

898
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:45,693
Come on, Divya!

899
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:47,844
- I'm so sorry... -On my shoes!

900
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,668
I'm feeling really sick...

901
00:50:51,945 --> 00:50:52,502
Not here.

902
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:53,616
Over the railing.

903
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,258
Over the railing.

904
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:57,231
Shut up Manav, you're so mean!

905
00:50:57,297 --> 00:50:58,897
Divya, that was epic!

906
00:50:59,208 --> 00:50:59,671
No!

907
00:50:59,696 --> 00:51:00,881
It was epuke!

908
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:07,692
Dude, I love your shoes!

909
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:08,986
Vomitino?

910
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,284
Louis Voui-ton?

911
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,772
Come on, Kabir...

912
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,122
You really think this is funny!

913
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:22,084
Divya what did you eat for breakfast?

914
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:22,776
No!

915
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:23,615
What did you eat for dessert?

916
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:24,660
Barf-i?

917
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,925
Istanbul!

918
00:51:46,096 --> 00:51:47,980
There is some magic in this name.

919
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:51,420
Anything can happen here...

920
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,274
Istanbul!

921
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,808
It's really beautiful!

922
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:25,341
Ready?

923
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,293
Smile!

924
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:28,857
Hello!

925
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:32,011
Take one more.

926
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:47,759
Namaste...

927
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,247
Sir, you can't be here...

928
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:41,385
I just want to meet..

929
00:53:41,454 --> 00:53:42,225
Hey!

930
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:45,600
Hey!

931
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:51,607
Hey!

932
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:54,114
Hi!

933
00:53:56,956 --> 00:53:57,975
What do you want?

934
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,528
Lunch.

935
00:54:00,293 --> 00:54:01,371
Yes or no?

936
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:04,440
Yes.

937
00:54:05,853 --> 00:54:06,931
Where?

938
00:54:08,252 --> 00:54:09,888
Taksim Square. 1.30.

939
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:22,125
There are rules, you know?

940
00:54:23,058 --> 00:54:24,136
Who says I am going?

941
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:26,985
Start again?

942
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:51,391
The rule is we can't get
personally involved with guests.

943
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,276
So if you can't stay
away from my rehearsal...

944
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,631
Keep your volume down.

945
00:54:58,441 --> 00:54:59,519
Kabir Mehra.

946
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,738
Farah Ali... Nice to meet you.

947
00:55:00,804 --> 00:55:02,060
Very nice to meet you...

948
00:55:02,438 --> 00:55:03,136
Come!

949
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:14,401
How long you on the cruise for?

950
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:15,439
Ten days.

951
00:55:15,506 --> 00:55:16,549
Oops!

952
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:19,022
We don't have much time.

953
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,490
So quickly tell me
everything about you.

954
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:23,232
You first.

955
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:24,693
Okay.

956
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,881
I'm from Delhi.

957
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:28,127
I'm from London.

958
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:29,172
25 years old.

959
00:55:29,444 --> 00:55:30,250
25 years old.

960
00:55:30,522 --> 00:55:31,256
Businessman.

961
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:32,577
Artist.

962
00:55:32,885 --> 00:55:33,727
I have one sister.

963
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:35,043
I have two sisters.

964
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,916
I have a dog.

965
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,379
I want a dog.

966
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:39,290
Grilled fish.

967
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,121
Kebab platter.

968
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:41,543
I can do a back flip.

969
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,008
I can fly a plane.

970
00:55:47,796 --> 00:55:49,017
Can you ride a cycle?

971
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:51,835
I have a birthmark on my right leg.

972
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:53,461
I have a scar on the right leg.

973
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:55,521
I fractured my hand when I was 8.

974
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:57,052
Toe fracture when I was 16.

975
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:57,988
No tattoos.

976
00:55:58,361 --> 00:55:59,096
One tattoo.

977
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:00,070
Where?

978
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:02,046
You're in a hurry!

979
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:04,621
Democracy!

980
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:05,524
Dictatorship!

981
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:06,398
What? Really?

982
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,302
Don't judge!

983
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:08,310
One serious girlfriend.

984
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:09,772
One serious boyfriend.

985
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:10,459
Cricket.

986
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:11,433
Basketball.

987
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,377
I love video games.

988
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:13,245
I hate video games.

989
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,221
What? Lame.

990
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,431
I can beat you in a cycle race.

991
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,611
You can try.

992
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:54,191
I bet my golf kit,

993
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:57,250
Your dad wants Lalit
Sood to invest in Ayka.

994
00:57:00,681 --> 00:57:01,665
Why would you think that?

995
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:04,956
Why else would he invite them?

996
00:57:07,702 --> 00:57:09,207
God I hope not...

997
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,788
That Lalit Sood is a vulture.

998
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:14,942
Your dad is a hawk.

999
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:16,748
It's a perfect match.

1000
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:22,588
Why don't we invest in Ayka?

1001
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,466
That way the company
will stay in the family.

1002
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:27,759
Are you crazy?

1003
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:30,816
I don't want any new equation with

1004
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:32,627
your father or brother.

1005
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:38,778
But...

1006
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,496
when it comes to you...

1007
00:57:43,989 --> 00:57:45,494
it's a different matter.

1008
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:53,244
Please, Manav..

1009
00:57:53,547 --> 00:57:54,661
Don't...

1010
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,690
It's been such a long day,
I'm so tired.

1011
00:57:57,752 --> 00:57:58,558
Please...

1012
00:57:59,037 --> 00:58:00,021
Please...

1013
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,463
Hey...

1014
00:58:26,948 --> 00:58:28,098
Come here.

1015
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:00,391
Pluto...

1016
00:59:01,948 --> 00:59:02,991
Hey!

1017
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:05,254
Pluto!

1018
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,622
Hi!

1019
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,006
Hi!

1020
00:59:09,873 --> 00:59:10,715
Hi!

1021
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:11,759
Hi, Pluto!

1022
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:12,933
Hi, handsome!

1023
00:59:19,896 --> 00:59:21,223
When I was one,

1024
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:22,607
whenever I heard music

1025
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,738
I would crawl to the speaker,

1026
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,792
hold if.

1027
00:59:28,203 --> 00:59:30,123
Prop myself up and jump...

1028
00:59:30,184 --> 00:59:31,097
Up and down.

1029
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,802
What a memory!

1030
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:35,960
Shut up!

1031
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:38,391
My mom told me.

1032
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,107
Born to dance...

1033
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:42,803
Yes.

1034
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,784
I was born to dance.

1035
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,221
And you...

1036
00:59:47,945 --> 00:59:48,928
Born for business?

1037
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,937
That's what my family says...

1038
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:56,643
Meaning?

1039
00:59:58,338 --> 01:00:00,186
That is all I heard since I was a kid.

1040
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,210
$0?

1041
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:05,160
I was always told I have to

1042
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:06,783
be a good housewife.

1043
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:08,774
Really?

1044
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,415
My family is very conservative.

1045
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,082
So then?

1046
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,663
How did you convince them?

1047
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:19,028
I couldn't...

1048
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:20,625
So I ran away.

1049
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:23,894
What do you mean ran away?

1050
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:27,855
Like literally ran away?

1051
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:29,588
Yes.

1052
01:00:30,105 --> 01:00:31,468
My house was in Birmingham.

1053
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,109
One night I packed my bag,

1054
01:00:34,346 --> 01:00:36,894
put the 200 pounds I had saved

1055
01:00:37,578 --> 01:00:38,597
in my pocket...

1056
01:00:38,899 --> 01:00:40,333
and I took a train to London.

1057
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:41,995
What?

1058
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,625
Where did you live?

1059
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:48,394
I had some friends there.

1060
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:52,844
If I was lucky, their couch,

1061
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,582
Otherwise a park bench.

1062
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,114
But mostly I was lucky.

1063
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,432
And money?

1064
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,554
I worked.

1065
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,360
Waitress.

1066
01:01:01,943 --> 01:01:03,270
Bartender.

1067
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:07,024
That way I saved money

1068
01:01:07,086 --> 01:01:08,627
and paid for dance school.

1069
01:01:12,926 --> 01:01:14,396
Fearless Farah...

1070
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,329
If you were in my place
even you would be fearless.

1071
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,419
You would've jumped from here...

1072
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:27,388
and then... sink or swim baby.

1073
01:01:32,946 --> 01:01:36,217
While some girls need to run,

1074
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:41,229
others have to hide.

1075
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,018
To live life on their own terms,

1076
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,482
girls are often left with no choice.

1077
01:01:49,351 --> 01:01:53,357
Interestingly enough,
if a boy meets a girl,

1078
01:01:53,939 --> 01:01:56,522
the family has no problem at all.

1079
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,540
In fact, they are happy

1080
01:01:59,986 --> 01:02:01,349
he's all grown up.

1081
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,136
But if a girl meets a boy,

1082
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,534
the family is apparently dishonoured.

1083
01:02:09,545 --> 01:02:11,288
Whatever this logic is...

1084
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,456
It's beyond my understanding.

1085
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,105
God!

1086
01:02:49,758 --> 01:02:50,351
Mom?

1087
01:02:50,627 --> 01:02:52,097
Where were you all night?

1088
01:02:54,242 --> 01:02:55,569
I was just hanging out.

1089
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,095
Hanging out what?

1090
01:02:57,892 --> 01:02:58,970
Clothes?

1091
01:02:59,665 --> 01:03:01,027
I was with a friend.

1092
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:02,107
We were talking.

1093
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:03,394
That's all.

1094
01:03:04,426 --> 01:03:05,576
Who is this friend?

1095
01:03:09,396 --> 01:03:10,901
Who is this friend?

1096
01:03:13,046 --> 01:03:13,994
Kabir...

1097
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,103
Last night...

1098
01:03:42,763 --> 01:03:44,920
Noorie was in Kabir's room.

1099
01:03:46,308 --> 01:03:47,423
How do you know?

1100
01:03:48,602 --> 01:03:50,237
Naina told me.

1101
01:03:50,305 --> 01:03:51,632
She is very upset.

1102
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:57,718
That's good news, Neelu!

1103
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:00,844
What are you doing?

1104
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,480
She is so upset!

1105
01:04:02,748 --> 01:04:03,863
I explained to her

1106
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,229
if the kids want
to be together then...

1107
01:04:06,294 --> 01:04:07,028
We don't mind.

1108
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:07,792
Absolutely.

1109
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,321
We have no problem.

1110
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,919
Why would they have a problem?

1111
01:04:20,474 --> 01:04:22,429
Noorie is Lalit Sood's only daughter

1112
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:25,066
and Kamal has zero credibility
in the market today.

1113
01:04:25,757 --> 01:04:27,500
Being related to us will benefit him.

1114
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,052
Come on, Lalit!

1115
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:29,235
Think of your own benefit.

1116
01:04:29,754 --> 01:04:30,347
What?

1117
01:04:30,623 --> 01:04:31,701
Noorie should get married.

1118
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:32,362
Come on, Naina.

1119
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,201
Come on.

1120
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:35,422
If we have to help them for that

1121
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,568
what is the problem!

1122
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:37,888
You are just...

1123
01:04:37,992 --> 01:04:39,248
Come on, trust me!

1124
01:04:48,975 --> 01:04:50,575
Where are you taking me?

1125
01:04:50,643 --> 01:04:51,970
Just come with me.

1126
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:53,643
You're making me nervous, Noorie.

1127
01:04:53,702 --> 01:04:54,579
Sit.

1128
01:04:54,675 --> 01:04:55,718
Why?

1129
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,004
Sit!

1130
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,041
If anyone asks,
I was with you last night...

1131
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:02,920
Please!

1132
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,590
Not bad, Noorie ji!

1133
01:05:10,211 --> 01:05:12,819
That's one hell of
an emergency landing.

1134
01:05:12,888 --> 01:05:13,658
Shut up!

1135
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,922
Don't tell anyone, okay?

1136
01:05:16,468 --> 01:05:17,618
Don't worry...

1137
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,257
Your secret is safe with me.

1138
01:05:19,978 --> 01:05:20,263
Thank you!

1139
01:05:20,326 --> 01:05:21,274
Now listen.

1140
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,465
If anyone asks...

1141
01:05:23,731 --> 01:05:26,030
Tell them I was a
little unwell so I left.

1142
01:05:26,095 --> 01:05:27,600
Where are you going?

1143
01:05:52,336 --> 01:05:53,284
Hey...

1144
01:05:56,507 --> 01:05:57,834
What're you doing?

1145
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:26,340
The first time

1146
01:06:27,372 --> 01:06:30,406
when I laid eyes on you

1147
01:06:32,724 --> 01:06:33,980
Hear me girl.

1148
01:06:35,227 --> 01:06:37,977
This is what I made of you

1149
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:44,059
I knew meeting you is the end of me

1150
01:06:44,229 --> 01:06:48,235
I spoke to my heart and said baby

1151
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,602
Don't go down this road

1152
01:06:51,945 --> 01:06:55,535
This is not meant to be

1153
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,195
But my heart...

1154
01:06:57,575 --> 01:06:59,281
said aloud

1155
01:07:00,669 --> 01:07:03,146
What has to be, will be

1156
01:07:03,206 --> 01:07:07,177
Have no fear, good or bad

1157
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:10,723
What has to be, will be

1158
01:07:10,992 --> 01:07:13,634
So, did you listen to your heart?

1159
01:07:14,606 --> 01:07:17,676
So, did you choose your path?

1160
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,177
Yes, I heard my heart

1161
01:07:22,183 --> 01:07:26,782
Yes, I chose my path!

1162
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,008
The first time

1163
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:38,836
when I laid eyes on you

1164
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,380
Hear me boy,

1165
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:46,484
this is what I made of you

1166
01:07:48,946 --> 01:07:52,359
I knew you take advice from your heart

1167
01:07:52,734 --> 01:07:56,384
I knew you are slightly crazy

1168
01:07:56,454 --> 01:08:00,318
We'll speak of love when we meet

1169
01:08:00,555 --> 01:08:04,205
And the things you
say will be very sweet

1170
01:08:04,274 --> 01:08:05,909
But my heart...

1171
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,996
said aloud

1172
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:11,861
What has to be, will be

1173
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,749
Have no fear, good or bad

1174
01:08:16,752 --> 01:08:19,300
What has to be, will be

1175
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:22,285
So, did you listen to your heart?

1176
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:26,321
So, did you choose your path?

1177
01:08:27,075 --> 01:08:29,896
Yes, I heard my heart

1178
01:08:30,794 --> 01:08:35,428
Yes, I chose my path!

1179
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:16,779
Like a wave crashes into another,

1180
01:09:17,055 --> 01:09:20,954
Our heartbeats intertwine

1181
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:25,123
We keep going, but lost in each other,

1182
01:09:25,397 --> 01:09:28,810
Are our hearts and minds.

1183
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:32,038
How and why did we get so close

1184
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:36,251
It may seem like a small thing

1185
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,724
You've been thirsty for a while now

1186
01:09:39,995 --> 01:09:43,301
And I too have been longing

1187
01:09:43,366 --> 01:09:46,921
I knew meeting you is the end of me

1188
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:51,088
I spoke to my heart and said baby

1189
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,631
Don't go down this road

1190
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:58,389
This is not meant to be

1191
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:00,224
But my heart...

1192
01:10:00,431 --> 01:10:02,316
said aloud

1193
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:06,168
What has to be, will be

1194
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:10,171
Have no fear, good or bad

1195
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:13,753
What has to be, will be

1196
01:10:13,814 --> 01:10:16,670
So, did you listen to your heart?

1197
01:10:17,636 --> 01:10:20,706
So, did you choose your path?

1198
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:24,208
Yes, I heard my heart

1199
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,639
Yes, I chose my path!

1200
01:10:40,172 --> 01:10:43,099
Our ship is not so far from Egypt

1201
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:44,347
that you can't come.

1202
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:48,455
Anyway I don't keep well these days...

1203
01:10:49,834 --> 01:10:52,549
Who knows if I will
be able to travel again.

1204
01:10:52,858 --> 01:10:53,973
Come, if you can...

1205
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:55,713
It will make me happy.

1206
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:56,897
Okay, son.

1207
01:10:57,099 --> 01:10:57,833
See you.

1208
01:11:04,328 --> 01:11:05,833
Come on, Amrish uncle

1209
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:08,085
Wasn't that a little too melodramatic?

1210
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:11,421
These days to meet your kids

1211
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:13,823
you have to do a little drama.

1212
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:19,736
You haven't seen
Sunny in a while, right?

1213
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:22,239
Yes.

1214
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:28,936
So he is in Egypt these days?

1215
01:11:30,292 --> 01:11:31,310
Yes. Egypt-

1216
01:11:33,107 --> 01:11:34,364
Look...

1217
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:43,954
Is that his girlfriend?

1218
01:11:45,828 --> 01:11:46,847
Who knows?

1219
01:11:47,253 --> 01:11:48,688
As if he will tell his father.

1220
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:04,843
Hey...

1221
01:12:11,097 --> 01:12:12,661
Thank you for inviting us.

1222
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:13,986
What are you saying, man...

1223
01:12:27,294 --> 01:12:28,242
Listen...

1224
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,248
Can I speak to you honestly?

1225
01:12:30,491 --> 01:12:31,439
Of course, Lalit.

1226
01:12:31,499 --> 01:12:32,898
There are no secrets between us.

1227
01:12:34,731 --> 01:12:37,138
What percentage of Ayka
are you planning to sell?

1228
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,261
Prem told me.

1229
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:43,981
49%.

1230
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:45,403
I'm not happy

1231
01:12:45,471 --> 01:12:47,628
but it's a way to expand the business.

1232
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:54,612
And what if I suggest...

1233
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,929
that we take our friendship...

1234
01:12:59,756 --> 01:13:02,163
to the next level?

1235
01:13:06,743 --> 01:13:09,493
The kids have grown quite close.

1236
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:12,621
Yes even I noticed.

1237
01:13:13,173 --> 01:13:14,050
Good!

1238
01:13:14,702 --> 01:13:16,136
Noorie is a very sensible girl.

1239
01:13:19,602 --> 01:13:22,601
So as I was saying...

1240
01:13:25,511 --> 01:13:27,740
Those shares...

1241
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:30,802
Why don't I buy them?

1242
01:13:33,053 --> 01:13:33,966
What?

1243
01:13:35,486 --> 01:13:39,836
If Kabir and Noorie
really want to be together

1244
01:13:40,352 --> 01:13:42,900
then the business
will stay in the family.

1245
01:13:44,836 --> 01:13:46,756
Kabir and Noorie?

1246
01:13:49,111 --> 01:13:50,095
Wow!

1247
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:54,818
The surprises life
throws at us, Lalit!

1248
01:13:55,194 --> 01:13:56,758
You tell me!

1249
01:14:07,915 --> 01:14:08,933
Cheers!

1250
01:14:09,688 --> 01:14:10,635
Cheers!

1251
01:14:18,828 --> 01:14:19,811
Good morning!

1252
01:14:21,192 --> 01:14:22,175
Good morning!

1253
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:25,895
Breakfast?

1254
01:14:26,961 --> 01:14:27,625
No...

1255
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:30,716
I have to host a dance
class for kids at 10.

1256
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:33,393
Come on, fearless Farah...

1257
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:35,308
Call in sick.

1258
01:14:35,894 --> 01:14:37,458
Don't you get sick leave?

1259
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:38,615
Of course!

1260
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:39,753
Without pay.

1261
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:40,805
So, I'll pay you,

1262
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:47,232
Money can't buy you everything, Mehra.

1263
01:14:49,971 --> 01:14:51,405
It's just one day, Ali.

1264
01:14:51,465 --> 01:14:52,721
Bunk it.

1265
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,747
You know...

1266
01:14:56,261 --> 01:14:58,668
Some people actually
enjoy what they do.

1267
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:00,721
Obviously you are not one of them.

1268
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:10,833
Lunch?

1269
01:15:11,972 --> 01:15:12,991
My treat.

1270
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:14,999
Lunch is not possible,

1271
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:16,605
I have a family commitment.

1272
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:18,509
You want to come with me?

1273
01:15:20,314 --> 01:15:21,605
To your family lunch?

1274
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:22,440
Yes.

1275
01:15:22,503 --> 01:15:23,830
Why should I suffer alone?

1276
01:15:27,334 --> 01:15:28,033
Are you sure?

1277
01:15:28,099 --> 01:15:28,905
Yes.

1278
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:30,923
Please come...

1279
01:15:30,983 --> 01:15:32,797
You should also meet the loonies.

1280
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,764
Will you come?

1281
01:15:39,152 --> 01:15:39,615
Okay...

1282
01:15:40,438 --> 01:15:41,030
Yes!

1283
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,701
You saved me!

1284
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:58,388
If they've invited you, you must go.

1285
01:15:58,803 --> 01:15:59,751
Great! Thank you.

1286
01:16:00,193 --> 01:16:01,899
We should make our guests
feel welcome.

1287
01:16:01,966 --> 01:16:02,700
So attending a party is

1288
01:16:02,765 --> 01:16:03,783
well within the boundaries.

1289
01:16:03,843 --> 01:16:04,506
Okay?

1290
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,739
Thanks!

1291
01:16:18,197 --> 01:16:19,311
I told you it is not a theme party.

1292
01:16:22,438 --> 01:16:23,066
Sorry...

1293
01:16:23,168 --> 01:16:25,360
I have to do this.

1294
01:16:28,276 --> 01:16:29,568
You knew it was a heart attack?

1295
01:16:29,841 --> 01:16:30,433
No.

1296
01:16:31,022 --> 01:16:32,527
It's god's grace,

1297
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:34,222
that Vandana isn't a widows today.

1298
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:35,864
Widow.

1299
01:16:37,244 --> 01:16:38,085
Drinking is allowed?

1300
01:16:38,148 --> 01:16:39,191
Yes...

1301
01:16:39,746 --> 01:16:40,967
I exercise a little

1302
01:16:41,032 --> 01:16:42,289
and I control my diets.

1303
01:16:43,986 --> 01:16:45,729
Tell Neelu to control her diet too.

1304
01:16:46,176 --> 01:16:48,510
Her food habits are very unhealthy.

1305
01:16:51,181 --> 01:16:53,694
And wanting the body
of a 24 year old at his age

1306
01:16:53,753 --> 01:16:55,009
is very healthy.

1307
01:17:01,886 --> 01:17:03,001
Hello, beautiful!

1308
01:17:03,069 --> 01:17:04,254
Kabir, where were you?

1309
01:17:06,231 --> 01:17:08,317
Farah, this is my
crazy sister, Ayesha.

1310
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:10,651
Everyone says that dad
gave us all this money...

1311
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:13,151
and you're crazy to
actually build the empire

1312
01:17:13,218 --> 01:17:14,166
that we've built.

1313
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:15,550
You need to look at the great leaders

1314
01:17:15,616 --> 01:17:16,315
and learn from them-

1315
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,850
Who is that girl with Kabir?

1316
01:17:21,038 --> 01:17:21,701
Oh!

1317
01:17:21,768 --> 01:17:22,396
I know her.

1318
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:24,582
She is a dancer at Cha Cha Cha Club.

1319
01:17:24,826 --> 01:17:26,047
She was fantastic.

1320
01:17:26,217 --> 01:17:27,852
Oh! I think I've seen it

1321
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,998
but from the outside.

1322
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:35,325
Hey Kabir, how's it going?

1323
01:17:35,983 --> 01:17:37,002
Good bro...

1324
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:39,808
What happened?

1325
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:42,211
Who is that girl?

1326
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:46,802
Why is everyone asking about her?

1327
01:17:47,731 --> 01:17:48,194
Who all?

1328
01:17:48,948 --> 01:17:49,754
Naina Sood.

1329
01:17:55,517 --> 01:17:56,986
She is a friend... Why?

1330
01:17:59,131 --> 01:18:00,423
Don't you think it's inappropriate

1331
01:18:00,486 --> 01:18:01,743
to bring her to the party?

1332
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:04,249
No, I don't think so.

1333
01:18:05,318 --> 01:18:06,882
Noorie could have a problem with it.

1334
01:18:07,507 --> 01:18:08,455
Noorie?

1335
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:12,524
Naina has told us everything.

1336
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:18,217
Told you what?

1337
01:18:22,141 --> 01:18:24,025
Noorie stayed in your room?

1338
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:25,654
Now don't pretend.

1339
01:18:25,929 --> 01:18:26,628
We know everything.

1340
01:18:32,532 --> 01:18:33,647
Mom...Noorie is...

1341
01:18:33,715 --> 01:18:34,971
From a respectable family,

1342
01:18:35,035 --> 01:18:36,019
as are YOU.

1343
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:38,826
What?

1344
01:18:39,693 --> 01:18:40,215
What is so funny ya?

1345
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:43,070
Is it a joke?

1346
01:18:48,382 --> 01:18:50,373
Kabir, it's a serious matter!

1347
01:18:53,352 --> 01:18:54,751
The Soods are also worried.

1348
01:18:54,811 --> 01:18:55,890
Papa, please ya!

1349
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:57,768
Lalit spoke to me himself.

1350
01:18:58,878 --> 01:19:00,798
I told him I'd speak
to you and let him know.

1351
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:02,986
Okay, tell me...

1352
01:19:04,892 --> 01:19:06,183
What is your intention with Noorie?

1353
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:08,198
My intention?!

1354
01:19:08,263 --> 01:19:09,341
Yes, your intention!

1355
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:11,886
Has anyone spoken to Noorie?

1356
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:14,315
I am sure her parents
will talk to her.

1357
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,007
Good.

1358
01:19:15,075 --> 01:19:16,474
Because she has no interest

1359
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:18,134
in a future with me.

1360
01:19:18,377 --> 01:19:19,776
Then make her interested!

1361
01:19:20,845 --> 01:19:22,623
But even I am not interested.

1362
01:19:23,973 --> 01:19:25,478
Are you interested in that plane?

1363
01:19:26,441 --> 01:19:26,998
Tell me...

1364
01:19:28,109 --> 01:19:29,472
Do you want the plane or not?

1365
01:19:31,306 --> 01:19:32,776
Are you bribing me?

1366
01:19:33,288 --> 01:19:34,828
Kabir, don't be silly...

1367
01:19:34,886 --> 01:19:36,072
No, what's going on?

1368
01:19:38,953 --> 01:19:40,494
Is Lalit Sood investing in Ayka?

1369
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:41,981
Yes!

1370
01:19:44,097 --> 01:19:45,768
If this marriage happens.

1371
01:19:46,774 --> 01:19:49,322
He will buy 49% stake in Ayka.

1372
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:52,024
The company control stays with us...

1373
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:53,867
Stays with you!

1374
01:19:53,933 --> 01:19:55,119
It will be perfect!

1375
01:19:56,957 --> 01:19:57,313
And...

1376
01:19:58,174 --> 01:19:59,880
We won't have to sell the plane.

1377
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,068
You can have it,

1378
01:20:01,372 --> 01:20:02,106
all by yourself!

1379
01:20:02,171 --> 01:20:03,214
You can take your friends...

1380
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:04,954
Fly Noorie around too!

1381
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:15,867
Noorie is such a lovely girl.

1382
01:20:17,742 --> 01:20:18,998
Papa, what are you guys doing here?

1383
01:20:19,063 --> 01:20:20,662
Everyone is asking...

1384
01:20:26,049 --> 01:20:27,092
What is going on?

1385
01:20:30,602 --> 01:20:31,373
You know what...

1386
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,211
Let me speak to Noorie.

1387
01:20:40,473 --> 01:20:40,995
Good.

1388
01:20:43,115 --> 01:20:44,027
About what?

1389
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:45,732
Tell your sister...

1390
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:46,979
Mom, please...

1391
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:47,776
I told you

1392
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:50,077
let me speak to Noorie first.

1393
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:50,939
Mom!

1394
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:54,379
Kabir and Noorie...

1395
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,103
What are you people doing?!

1396
01:21:00,493 --> 01:21:01,784
What are we doing?

1397
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:03,417
Kabir, have you lost your mind?

1398
01:21:03,586 --> 01:21:04,393
Lost your mind?

1399
01:21:04,872 --> 01:21:06,412
They are made for each other!

1400
01:21:06,471 --> 01:21:08,177
You said the same
thing about Manav and me

1401
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:09,602
and now I want a divorce-

1402
01:21:20,652 --> 01:21:21,458
What did she say?

1403
01:21:52,176 --> 01:21:52,840
Come here...

1404
01:21:52,906 --> 01:21:54,305
What are you doing?

1405
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:00,944
Sunny is here.

1406
01:22:01,248 --> 01:22:02,125
Oh my god!

1407
01:22:03,959 --> 01:22:05,251
That's all I need...

1408
01:22:05,836 --> 01:22:06,465
What is going on, dude...

1409
01:22:06,531 --> 01:22:07,373
You are freaking me out.

1410
01:22:07,434 --> 01:22:08,063
I am freaking you out?

1411
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:08,344
Yes!

1412
01:22:08,408 --> 01:22:09,250
I am freaking you out!

1413
01:22:09,311 --> 01:22:10,354
And what are you doing?

1414
01:22:11,571 --> 01:22:13,420
Don't listen to them.

1415
01:22:13,482 --> 01:22:14,881
You don't know them.

1416
01:22:15,151 --> 01:22:16,585
Can you forget them for a moment?

1417
01:22:16,646 --> 01:22:18,186
How can I?

1418
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:21,694
They do everything
for their own benefit

1419
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:22,596
Kabir!

1420
01:22:23,389 --> 01:22:24,989
Do you really want this marriage?

1421
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:28,222
Do you really want this divorce?

1422
01:22:59,676 --> 01:23:01,419
Has Ayesha mentioned
this to you before?

1423
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:05,593
She said they are having problems.

1424
01:23:06,801 --> 01:23:07,678
What problems?

1425
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:09,759
I don't know...

1426
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:11,079
I didn't ask.

1427
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:13,270
You didn't ask?

1428
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:15,743
You didn't even ask?

1429
01:23:17,298 --> 01:23:17,997
Are you deaf?

1430
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:21,964
I said what I had to.

1431
01:23:22,442 --> 01:23:23,484
Every marriage has problems.

1432
01:23:23,554 --> 01:23:25,545
No need to make it an issue, move on.

1433
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,840
What great advice, Neelam.

1434
01:23:28,942 --> 01:23:30,720
She is moving on to a divorce.

1435
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:32,806
If you know better, speak to her.

1436
01:23:32,939 --> 01:23:34,017
She is your daughter too.

1437
01:23:34,085 --> 01:23:35,721
Why do you keep telling me?

1438
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,870
Should I ask Prem to talk to her?

1439
01:23:46,702 --> 01:23:47,650
They are quite close.

1440
01:23:49,135 --> 01:23:50,285
That's a brilliant idea!

1441
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:53,794
Then he'll tell lndu and that radio

1442
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:55,675
will broadcast it all over Delhi.

1443
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,766
She just needs an
excuse to talk about me.

1444
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:59,496
I think it's a fantastic idea!

1445
01:24:03,211 --> 01:24:04,752
Neelam ji will be really happy, Sunny.

1446
01:24:05,715 --> 01:24:07,149
She's asked about you twice.

1447
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:10,900
How long will you keep working, Papa?

1448
01:24:12,144 --> 01:24:12,950
What else will I do?

1449
01:24:13,604 --> 01:24:14,375
Retire...

1450
01:24:15,099 --> 01:24:15,727
I am here.

1451
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,200
How can I just quit?

1452
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,421
How would they feel.

1453
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,446
They treat us like family.

1454
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,013
Who takes their manager on a cruise?

1455
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:30,298
Ayesha! Look...

1456
01:24:31,052 --> 01:24:32,273
The melodrama worked!

1457
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:34,296
Yes...

1458
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:37,554
Don't be too long.

1459
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:39,435
They are waiting.

1460
01:24:50,898 --> 01:24:51,669
Hi...

1461
01:24:51,732 --> 01:24:52,680
Hi...

1462
01:24:54,234 --> 01:24:55,834
I thought you weren't coming.

1463
01:24:56,494 --> 01:24:57,821
Sorry to disappoint you.

1464
01:24:58,405 --> 01:24:59,875
No, not at all...

1465
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,505
Good you came.

1466
01:25:01,637 --> 01:25:04,008
Amrish uncle was really missing you.

1467
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:08,940
You are looking good.

1468
01:25:10,293 --> 01:25:10,720
Different.

1469
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:11,548
Yeah...

1470
01:25:11,788 --> 01:25:12,416
Thanks!

1471
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:14,647
Everything else okay?

1472
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,522
Perfect.

1473
01:25:18,182 --> 01:25:19,332
And your husband...

1474
01:25:20,024 --> 01:25:20,795
Manav.

1475
01:25:20,858 --> 01:25:21,285
Manav.

1476
01:25:21,345 --> 01:25:22,364
Sorry... How is he?

1477
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:23,327
He is amazing.

1478
01:25:23,396 --> 01:25:26,003
I've been very lucky, touchwood.

1479
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:27,717
That's great.

1480
01:25:28,714 --> 01:25:29,591
Yes...

1481
01:25:29,722 --> 01:25:31,677
Oh my God!

1482
01:25:31,738 --> 01:25:34,345
It's Captain Sunny Gill!

1483
01:25:34,414 --> 01:25:35,919
It's Mr. Captain to you.

1484
01:25:35,978 --> 01:25:38,561
Mr. Captain Sunny Gill!

1485
01:25:40,774 --> 01:25:43,357
You never know who you'll run into

1486
01:25:43,624 --> 01:25:49,088
when you turn a corner.

1487
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:51,973
Sunny Gill.

1488
01:25:53,182 --> 01:25:56,904
There was a time when Sunny
and Ayesha were very close.

1489
01:25:58,222 --> 01:25:59,786
The best of friends.

1490
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:03,724
In fact, Sunny was the
one who gave me to Ayesha.

1491
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:05,809
Those were the days.

1492
01:26:06,043 --> 01:26:07,963
Sunny, Ayesha and Kabir.

1493
01:26:08,267 --> 01:26:10,045
That was my whole world.

1494
01:26:11,048 --> 01:26:12,826
Then Sunny went far away.

1495
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,080
Ayesha got married.

1496
01:26:15,566 --> 01:26:18,528
Her new family didn't want me.

1497
01:26:19,564 --> 01:26:22,598
And I ended up with Kabir.

1498
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:26,968
Today, once again,
we are all together...

1499
01:26:28,044 --> 01:26:29,964
and all I can hope for is that

1500
01:26:31,658 --> 01:26:33,294
this time it stays that way.

1501
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:40,976
God bless you!

1502
01:26:42,085 --> 01:26:43,626
Big journalist you have become.

1503
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:46,438
I try to read your articles,

1504
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,863
but they are very depressing.

1505
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:49,702
All this bloodshed, war...

1506
01:26:49,975 --> 01:26:51,753
Write some good news also!

1507
01:26:51,852 --> 01:26:53,417
I write in the hope that one day

1508
01:26:53,799 --> 01:26:54,949
the news will get better.

1509
01:26:55,606 --> 01:26:56,033
Neelu!

1510
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,284
Just look at this...

1511
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,139
That's beautiful!

1512
01:27:01,793 --> 01:27:02,421
İt's from Egypt-

1513
01:27:02,488 --> 01:27:03,566
Beautiful... Thank you.

1514
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:04,507
You are most welcome.

1515
01:27:04,608 --> 01:27:05,592
And also...

1516
01:27:05,964 --> 01:27:06,698
Thank you for the cheque.

1517
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:09,414
Who pays back money these days.

1518
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:11,247
That too with interest, Amrish saab!

1519
01:27:13,297 --> 01:27:14,624
I could never really repay you

1520
01:27:15,626 --> 01:27:16,953
for all you've done for me.

1521
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,432
Oh ho! Come here...

1522
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:25,883
You're like our son.

1523
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:28,806
Now go get ready.

1524
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:32,039
Let's put our Punjabi livers to use!

1525
01:27:32,101 --> 01:27:32,599
Okay!

1526
01:27:35,229 --> 01:27:36,344
Bye, son!

1527
01:27:45,795 --> 01:27:47,086
Why did you take money from him?

1528
01:27:48,089 --> 01:27:50,044
He insisted, so I had to.

1529
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:51,053
Why?

1530
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:55,920
He is a good kid.

1531
01:27:56,674 --> 01:27:58,701
I am glad he is doing so well.

1532
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,687
I always knew he has it in him.

1533
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,755
I'm glad I sent him
to study in America.

1534
01:28:07,588 --> 01:28:09,436
You sent him to study?

1535
01:28:10,681 --> 01:28:12,246
As far as I can remember

1536
01:28:12,523 --> 01:28:14,028
you had another reason.

1537
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:53,645
Neelam.

1538
01:28:54,822 --> 01:28:56,007
Sorry we are late.

1539
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:57,956
Actually,
we were waiting for our friends.

1540
01:28:58,055 --> 01:28:59,726
They live here in Kusadasi.

1541
01:29:00,487 --> 01:29:01,009
Sandhya

1542
01:29:01,078 --> 01:29:01,884
Naren

1543
01:29:01,948 --> 01:29:02,576
Hi!

1544
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,739
And this is Guler.

1545
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:05,706
Oh yes.

1546
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:06,996
Guler.

1547
01:29:07,057 --> 01:29:07,520
Hello...

1548
01:29:07,786 --> 01:29:09,327
Hi!

1549
01:29:10,358 --> 01:29:11,093
Guler.

1550
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:11,929
Gyuler.

1551
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:13,252
Gyuler...

1552
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:14,155
That's better.

1553
01:29:15,746 --> 01:29:16,445
Shall we?

1554
01:29:17,797 --> 01:29:18,639
Where is Noorie?

1555
01:29:18,874 --> 01:29:19,822
Don't ask!

1556
01:29:19,882 --> 01:29:20,866
You know how these kids are.

1557
01:29:20,925 --> 01:29:22,395
She has left us

1558
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,375
and gone out with their son Kabir.

1559
01:29:53,214 --> 01:29:53,806
Mom!

1560
01:29:58,879 --> 01:30:01,214
Don't worry about Manav & me...

1561
01:30:01,278 --> 01:30:02,049
We're fine.

1562
01:30:02,077 --> 01:30:04,376
I don't know why I said all that.

1563
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:05,630
Good.

1564
01:30:07,221 --> 01:30:08,620
I think I was really upset and-

1565
01:30:08,681 --> 01:30:09,700
Not now, Ayesha.

1566
01:30:10,835 --> 01:30:11,713
We'll talk later.

1567
01:30:16,988 --> 01:30:17,686
Smita Ji...

1568
01:30:17,856 --> 01:30:18,176
Manav...

1569
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,281
Namaste.

1570
01:30:19,907 --> 01:30:20,784
He is a journalist.

1571
01:30:21,923 --> 01:30:23,807
He writes for The Geographic.

1572
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,335
İt's very big paper"-

1573
01:30:25,469 --> 01:30:26,417
You must be reading it?

1574
01:30:26,476 --> 01:30:27,140
Papa...

1575
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:28,008
Please.

1576
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:29,125
That's okay...

1577
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,756
Let him show off, it's only fair.

1578
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:33,156
Better if he did it behind my back.

1579
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:34,581
Hi.

1580
01:30:36,486 --> 01:30:36,842
Hi.

1581
01:30:37,043 --> 01:30:38,370
My wife, Ayesha.

1582
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:41,707
They used to be best friends.

1583
01:30:42,013 --> 01:30:43,091
Used to be meaning?

1584
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:44,733
Nothing...

1585
01:30:45,245 --> 01:30:46,122
He went away to America.

1586
01:30:48,895 --> 01:30:50,009
Where did you study, son?

1587
01:30:51,293 --> 01:30:52,064
Yale, aunty.

1588
01:30:52,475 --> 01:30:53,317
Oh!

1589
01:30:54,108 --> 01:30:55,543
My uncle used to read law there...

1590
01:30:56,054 --> 01:30:57,903
'68...maybe '69...

1591
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,261
Will she hang it on the walls?

1592
01:31:00,365 --> 01:31:01,965
You can hang carpets
on the wall right?

1593
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,646
I guess if you don't understand art

1594
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,973
then you should hang carpets!

1595
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:09,759
Excuse me.

1596
01:31:09,957 --> 01:31:12,079
That's an amazing story.

1597
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,302
Thank you.

1598
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:15,458
Thank you for listening.

1599
01:31:15,935 --> 01:31:16,528
Neelam...

1600
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:18,029
Come sit with us.

1601
01:31:18,299 --> 01:31:19,591
I am sure they'll
give us another chair.

1602
01:31:19,654 --> 01:31:20,496
No, I am good...

1603
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:21,435
lam really good.

1604
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,759
I just wanted to borrow
my husband for a minute...

1605
01:31:23,825 --> 01:31:24,631
Of course.

1606
01:31:24,799 --> 01:31:25,533
Darling

1607
01:31:35,295 --> 01:31:37,843
Do you have to do
this on our anniversary?

1608
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,963
Why, what did I do?

1609
01:31:41,343 --> 01:31:43,263
Please don't embarrass me, Kamal.

1610
01:31:44,019 --> 01:31:46,460
You've been stuck to
that Guler like a leech.

1611
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:48,304
Have you gone mad?

1612
01:31:49,615 --> 01:31:50,657
They are our guests.

1613
01:31:51,492 --> 01:31:53,411
I am just looking after them

1614
01:31:53,681 --> 01:31:54,759
and so should you.

1615
01:32:56,605 --> 01:32:58,170
You know Noorie and me are together?

1616
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:00,814
So why did you propose to her?

1617
01:33:01,054 --> 01:33:01,825
Me?

1618
01:33:02,305 --> 01:33:04,225
Kamal uncle spoke to my parents.

1619
01:33:04,669 --> 01:33:05,261
Excuse me?

1620
01:33:05,433 --> 01:33:07,211
Your parents spoke to my dad-

1621
01:33:07,275 --> 01:33:08,318
Whatever, Kabir.

1622
01:33:08,388 --> 01:33:09,300
You could have said no.

1623
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,024
No.

1624
01:33:11,029 --> 01:33:12,285
Because thanks to Noorie,
everyone thinks

1625
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,784
she is in my room every night.

1626
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:16,145
Thank you...

1627
01:33:16,347 --> 01:33:17,461
For keeping quiet.

1628
01:33:17,529 --> 01:33:18,548
But enough now.

1629
01:33:18,954 --> 01:33:20,981
We are not in school.

1630
01:33:21,386 --> 01:33:23,685
I don't care what our families think.

1631
01:33:24,862 --> 01:33:26,225
I care, baby.

1632
01:33:30,284 --> 01:33:31,232
Babies!

1633
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:35,433
You guys really like each other.

1634
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:38,209
Wow!

1635
01:33:39,217 --> 01:33:41,587
Your story is just
like Romeo and Juliet...

1636
01:33:42,276 --> 01:33:44,433
Warring families, tragic ending...

1637
01:33:45,577 --> 01:33:47,142
That was a bad space, man!

1638
01:33:53,016 --> 01:33:54,166
But what if I say...

1639
01:33:56,144 --> 01:33:59,035
That your story can
have a happy twist...

1640
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:00,465
How?

1641
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,314
By getting engaged to me.

1642
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:05,292
Excuse me?

1643
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,884
No, no... Wait. Hear me out...

1644
01:34:07,579 --> 01:34:08,598
Just for now.

1645
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:12,730
Mom, Dad,
Uncle, Aunty, everyone happy!

1646
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:14,115
Then...

1647
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:16,967
A few months later...

1648
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:19,191
I will dump you.

1649
01:34:19,814 --> 01:34:20,169
Great!

1650
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:20,788
Wait, wait...

1651
01:34:22,107 --> 01:34:22,605
Then...

1652
01:34:23,393 --> 01:34:26,249
You cry, shout, scream, pass out...

1653
01:34:26,312 --> 01:34:28,019
Try to kill yourself...

1654
01:34:28,085 --> 01:34:28,370
Sure!

1655
01:34:28,433 --> 01:34:31,148
Your parents will
do anything to save you.

1656
01:34:32,222 --> 01:34:32,542
Right?

1657
01:34:34,272 --> 01:34:34,592
Then...

1658
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:35,907
You say...

1659
01:34:37,574 --> 01:34:38,901
"I want to be with Noorie."

1660
01:34:41,154 --> 01:34:41,925
That's it...

1661
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,320
For your parents he will be like

1662
01:34:44,386 --> 01:34:45,501
a knight in shining armour!

1663
01:34:49,252 --> 01:34:50,235
It's genius!

1664
01:34:52,242 --> 01:34:53,284
And what about your parents?

1665
01:34:55,578 --> 01:34:56,941
What do you mean cancel the wedding?

1666
01:34:57,942 --> 01:34:59,447
The cards have been printed.

1667
01:35:00,792 --> 01:35:01,870
What do I do?

1668
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,120
Noorie loves someone else.

1669
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:07,995
Who?

1670
01:35:09,898 --> 01:35:11,083
She loves Rana.

1671
01:35:11,949 --> 01:35:12,897
Rana Khanna?

1672
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:15,704
Because of their family problems,
she agreed-

1673
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,023
This is ridiculous!

1674
01:35:17,475 --> 01:35:18,590
I'm going to call Naina right now.

1675
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:20,679
It isn't Noorie's fault, Mom!

1676
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:22,656
It's mine.

1677
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:26,130
So stupid...

1678
01:35:28,632 --> 01:35:30,659
I did all this for the company.

1679
01:35:32,942 --> 01:35:35,276
But I really fell in love with her.

1680
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:41,225
I just want her to be happy.

1681
01:35:41,561 --> 01:35:42,782
That's all I want.

1682
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:45,388
Oh my baby...

1683
01:35:46,393 --> 01:35:47,614
Oh my child...

1684
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,545
I made a big mistake.

1685
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:54,633
What are we going to do, Papa?

1686
01:35:56,716 --> 01:35:57,758
You should sell the plane.

1687
01:35:57,967 --> 01:35:58,879
No...

1688
01:35:59,044 --> 01:35:59,885
No!

1689
01:36:00,122 --> 01:36:01,141
Absolutely not!

1690
01:36:01,303 --> 01:36:03,223
That's the least we can do for him.

1691
01:36:22,019 --> 01:36:23,204
You look very happy...

1692
01:36:24,939 --> 01:36:27,024
lam thinking about our bright future.

1693
01:36:28,553 --> 01:36:31,409
I've seen many make
promises on this ship.

1694
01:36:32,306 --> 01:36:33,633
But as soon
as the journey ends...

1695
01:36:33,697 --> 01:36:35,202
<i>Poo“</i>

1696
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:36,722
Gone!

1697
01:36:39,745 --> 01:36:41,036
Are you allergic to romance?

1698
01:36:42,108 --> 01:36:43,151
I am being practical.

1699
01:36:43,707 --> 01:36:45,662
Being practical!!!

1700
01:36:46,314 --> 01:36:48,020
Is that what they teach you in London

1701
01:36:48,086 --> 01:36:49,272
is to be practical?

1702
01:36:49,685 --> 01:36:50,420
You see it's very important

1703
01:36:50,484 --> 01:36:52,819
for every individual to be practical!

1704
01:36:53,612 --> 01:36:54,940
If Shah Jehan was practical,

1705
01:36:55,003 --> 01:36:56,437
who would've built the Taj Mahal?

1706
01:37:00,217 --> 01:37:01,235
What are you doing?

1707
01:37:01,746 --> 01:37:02,967
Say you love me...

1708
01:37:03,623 --> 01:37:04,357
What?

1709
01:37:04,422 --> 01:37:05,085
Say you love me.

1710
01:37:05,604 --> 01:37:06,067
No...

1711
01:37:06,507 --> 01:37:07,100
Say it.

1712
01:37:07,724 --> 01:37:08,008
No!

1713
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:08,735
Say it!

1714
01:37:09,183 --> 01:37:11,032
Kabir stop it, I am really ticklish.

1715
01:37:11,096 --> 01:37:11,973
No!

1716
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:13,330
Say it!

1717
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,494
I love you!

1718
01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:27,266
You could be on any ship...

1719
01:37:28,266 --> 01:37:30,079
It won't sail without me.

1720
01:38:53,364 --> 01:38:54,584
Awesome!

1721
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:55,835
Thank you!

1722
01:38:56,561 --> 01:38:57,296
Who's next?

1723
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:58,585
Me!

1724
01:39:06,189 --> 01:39:07,267
Kiss me!

1725
01:39:11,507 --> 01:39:12,526
Any requests?

1726
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:23,438
Who did this?

1727
01:39:23,638 --> 01:39:24,965
What nonsense is this?

1728
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,182
Who did it?

1729
01:39:27,252 --> 01:39:28,094
Don't laugh, Jamaal.

1730
01:39:28,155 --> 01:39:29,590
This is rubbish!

1731
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:31,011
I am waiting.

1732
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,054
Bhabhi Ji!

1733
01:39:32,118 --> 01:39:33,196
Vinod, don't get involved.

1734
01:39:33,265 --> 01:39:34,521
It was a jokes.

1735
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:36,534
Bhabhi ji, it was a jokes.

1736
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:38,236
Kids joke.

1737
01:39:38,304 --> 01:39:40,603
This is very wrong, whoever did this.

1738
01:39:40,668 --> 01:39:41,616
Don't do it again.

1739
01:39:42,162 --> 01:39:43,632
Okay? Sorted?

1740
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:44,710
Now have a drinks!

1741
01:39:46,854 --> 01:39:50,090
Ok now, a song for the host couples!

1742
01:40:00,515 --> 01:40:02,885
I'll break into a bhangra

1743
01:40:02,947 --> 01:40:04,547
You also put on your dancing shoes

1744
01:40:04,616 --> 01:40:06,535
Come on, let's paint this town red

1745
01:40:06,597 --> 01:40:08,825
And get everyone
to show us their moves

1746
01:40:12,609 --> 01:40:14,767
I feel like fetching

1747
01:40:14,834 --> 01:40:16,648
For you the stars & the moon

1748
01:40:16,676 --> 01:40:18,667
The moon, I'll place in my hand

1749
01:40:18,727 --> 01:40:20,920
In my hair, will be the stars strewn.

1750
01:40:24,531 --> 01:40:26,486
Hello Hello...

1751
01:40:26,547 --> 01:40:28,538
Since you've hit the floor

1752
01:40:28,598 --> 01:40:30,304
Yello Yello...

1753
01:40:30,579 --> 01:40:32,534
A magic night is in store

1754
01:40:32,595 --> 01:40:34,550
Hello Hello...

1755
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:36,601
You seem to have consumed a lot

1756
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:38,546
Yello Yello...

1757
01:40:38,643 --> 01:40:40,765
Brother, you got no control at all!

1758
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,717
The heart beats hard and fast

1759
01:40:42,778 --> 01:40:45,777
The bangles from Punjab are tinkling

1760
01:40:45,802 --> 01:40:47,888
The night is fun, so my dearest one

1761
01:40:47,957 --> 01:40:50,992
Lets get down to some mingling

1762
01:40:58,732 --> 01:41:00,687
The heart beats hard and fast

1763
01:41:00,748 --> 01:41:03,710
The bangles from Punjab are tinkling

1764
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:06,071
The night is fun, so my dearest one

1765
01:41:06,135 --> 01:41:08,778
Lets get down to some mingling

1766
01:41:16,527 --> 01:41:18,684
That flutter in your eyes

1767
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,501
Tortures me a lot

1768
01:41:20,559 --> 01:41:22,717
Till date you just have to look at me

1769
01:41:22,783 --> 01:41:25,331
And an arrow hits the spot

1770
01:41:28,623 --> 01:41:30,745
Without a drink I get high

1771
01:41:30,812 --> 01:41:32,591
Your beauty is all I need

1772
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,680
How can anyone stay sane

1773
01:41:34,741 --> 01:41:37,182
With the restlessness
you make them feel

1774
01:41:40,545 --> 01:41:42,251
Hello Hello...

1775
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,445
These hearts must connect

1776
01:41:44,507 --> 01:41:46,427
Yello Yello...

1777
01:41:46,489 --> 01:41:48,681
The line should be direct

1778
01:41:48,747 --> 01:41:50,525
The heart beats hard and fast

1779
01:41:50,590 --> 01:41:53,589
The bangles from Punjab are tinkling

1780
01:41:53,788 --> 01:41:55,566
The night is fun, so my dearest one

1781
01:41:55,595 --> 01:41:58,700
Lets get down to some mingling

1782
01:42:06,891 --> 01:42:08,491
The heart beats hard and fast

1783
01:42:08,558 --> 01:42:11,557
The bangles from Punjab are tinkling

1784
01:42:11,722 --> 01:42:13,535
The night is fun, so my dearest one

1785
01:42:13,599 --> 01:42:17,533
Lets get down to some mingling

1786
01:43:16,717 --> 01:43:18,707
I don't know why

1787
01:43:18,733 --> 01:43:20,369
This crazy girl's so happy

1788
01:43:20,783 --> 01:43:22,454
Can this story please be

1789
01:43:22,591 --> 01:43:24,475
Explained to me

1790
01:43:24,607 --> 01:43:26,421
The thing that everyone wants

1791
01:43:26,623 --> 01:43:28,578
ls to find their dream woman or man

1792
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:30,558
That is what has happened here

1793
01:43:30,654 --> 01:43:32,847
Now do you understand

1794
01:43:32,949 --> 01:43:33,861
Now I know,

1795
01:43:33,992 --> 01:43:36,848
The song you are sing

1796
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:38,899
Tougher than finding the love

1797
01:43:38,996 --> 01:43:40,667
ls honoring the thing

1798
01:43:40,734 --> 01:43:42,299
Hello Hello...

1799
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:44,422
don't mind if I say this much

1800
01:43:44,487 --> 01:43:46,301
Yello Yello...

1801
01:43:46,539 --> 01:43:48,980
Could you please keep in touch

1802
01:43:49,006 --> 01:43:50,571
The heart beats hard and fast

1803
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,674
The bangles from Punjab are tinkling

1804
01:43:53,872 --> 01:43:55,615
The night is fun, so my dearest one

1805
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,749
Lets get down to some mingling

1806
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:08,789
The heart beats hard and fast

1807
01:44:08,818 --> 01:44:11,888
The bangles from Punjab are tinkling

1808
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:13,615
The night is fun, so my dearest one

1809
01:44:13,683 --> 01:44:16,753
Lets get down to some mingling

1810
01:44:31,062 --> 01:44:32,141
Here you all are!

1811
01:44:32,209 --> 01:44:34,023
Delhi's Beyonce!!!

1812
01:44:34,086 --> 01:44:35,865
lndu Aunty!!!

1813
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:41,638
You are the one!

1814
01:44:42,184 --> 01:44:43,370
She is a star!

1815
01:44:44,582 --> 01:44:45,839
Why are you in the bar, Putlu?

1816
01:44:45,903 --> 01:44:48,416
Where else would
I be after your dance?

1817
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:49,420
Shut up!

1818
01:44:49,657 --> 01:44:51,506
lndu Aunty you were amazing!

1819
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:52,027
Thanks!

1820
01:44:52,091 --> 01:44:52,825
$0 good!

1821
01:44:53,133 --> 01:44:54,283
I got carried away.

1822
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:56,787
I would never do this in Delhi.

1823
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:58,420
What would people think?

1824
01:44:58,729 --> 01:45:00,199
They won't think anything.

1825
01:45:00,258 --> 01:45:02,036
We are ready for your talent.

1826
01:45:02,934 --> 01:45:04,333
Maybe you are ready

1827
01:45:04,394 --> 01:45:06,586
but what will the public say?

1828
01:45:06,757 --> 01:45:08,192
You will have to migrate now,

1829
01:45:08,252 --> 01:45:09,615
it's about your image!

1830
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,720
You journalists make such
a big deal about everything.

1831
01:45:14,786 --> 01:45:16,007
Big deal?

1832
01:45:16,942 --> 01:45:17,641
Really?

1833
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:19,868
Yes... Seriously.

1834
01:45:20,244 --> 01:45:22,958
Look what you're writing
on women's issues...

1835
01:45:23,441 --> 01:45:25,598
You people make it seem like

1836
01:45:26,013 --> 01:45:29,142
women here are unsafe all the time.

1837
01:45:30,253 --> 01:45:31,723
Every survey seems to say that.

1838
01:45:32,234 --> 01:45:33,669
And it's not just about safety,

1839
01:45:33,729 --> 01:45:35,851
it's also about equal rights-

1840
01:45:35,919 --> 01:45:37,459
Precisely, things are changing.

1841
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:38,879
Slowly but surely,
things are changing.

1842
01:45:39,117 --> 01:45:40,159
Take my own family...

1843
01:45:40,993 --> 01:45:44,027
Till my dad's generation,
no woman had worked.

1844
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:44,716
Never!

1845
01:45:46,068 --> 01:45:48,331
But I allowed Ayesha
to run her business.

1846
01:45:52,185 --> 01:45:53,027
You allowed Ayesha?

1847
01:45:53,158 --> 01:45:53,656
Yes!

1848
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,416
And why does she need your permission?

1849
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:00,707
You know what I mean.

1850
01:46:01,743 --> 01:46:03,414
No, I don't know what you mean.

1851
01:46:03,828 --> 01:46:05,783
Allowing someone means you are

1852
01:46:05,845 --> 01:46:08,038
in a position of authority,
of control...

1853
01:46:09,007 --> 01:46:10,714
And that is not equality.

1854
01:46:13,282 --> 01:46:14,017
But thank you.

1855
01:46:14,951 --> 01:46:17,393
You just proved my point.

1856
01:46:20,199 --> 01:46:21,111
Cheers!

1857
01:46:22,493 --> 01:46:23,405
I love you...

1858
01:46:28,784 --> 01:46:29,970
lndu yaar!

1859
01:46:36,256 --> 01:46:37,062
Sunny!

1860
01:46:39,454 --> 01:46:40,853
What was that?

1861
01:46:41,401 --> 01:46:41,958
What?

1862
01:46:43,451 --> 01:46:45,016
What was the need to be rude to Manav?

1863
01:46:45,536 --> 01:46:46,793
Why put him down?

1864
01:46:46,857 --> 01:46:47,841
What was the point...

1865
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,334
And he can put you down?

1866
01:46:52,002 --> 01:46:52,773
Okay.

1867
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:56,905
I am still talking to you.

1868
01:46:56,972 --> 01:46:58,157
What do you want to say?

1869
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:00,942
What do you want to say?

1870
01:47:05,557 --> 01:47:07,098
I know you sold your jewellery

1871
01:47:07,155 --> 01:47:08,482
to start your business.

1872
01:47:09,415 --> 01:47:10,433
Without anybody's help

1873
01:47:10,493 --> 01:47:12,199
look at where you've reached.

1874
01:47:12,508 --> 01:47:14,144
And I am really proud of you!

1875
01:47:16,435 --> 01:47:16,898
That's it.

1876
01:48:06,659 --> 01:48:07,702
Who the hell does he think he is?

1877
01:48:09,753 --> 01:48:11,638
How can he lecture me about you?

1878
01:48:13,228 --> 01:48:15,811
He must think I ill-treat you.

1879
01:48:17,086 --> 01:48:17,893
Ridiculous!

1880
01:48:18,998 --> 01:48:20,539
Bloody journalist-activist types.

1881
01:48:21,187 --> 01:48:22,515
They have no balance.

1882
01:48:22,648 --> 01:48:24,391
Everything is black or white for them.

1883
01:48:26,089 --> 01:48:28,874
Don't I have a say
in what my wife does?

1884
01:48:29,773 --> 01:48:31,693
Don't I have the right to an opinion?

1885
01:48:33,527 --> 01:48:34,570
We are a married couple, dammit.

1886
01:48:35,785 --> 01:48:36,449
I have the right.

1887
01:48:36,516 --> 01:48:37,558
I want a divorce...

1888
01:48:38,115 --> 01:48:40,177
And when I said that I allow you,

1889
01:48:40,234 --> 01:48:41,669
it doesn't mean that-

1890
01:48:41,729 --> 01:48:42,844
I want a divorce.

1891
01:48:44,163 --> 01:48:44,826
What?

1892
01:48:48,576 --> 01:48:50,081
You want a divorce...

1893
01:48:50,141 --> 01:48:53,447
Because of that stupid argument?

1894
01:48:57,648 --> 01:48:59,568
Because I don't love you.

1895
01:49:07,241 --> 01:49:08,983
I really tried, Manav...

1896
01:49:16,173 --> 01:49:18,093
But I can't pretend anymore.

1897
01:49:19,823 --> 01:49:20,700
I can't...

1898
01:49:23,472 --> 01:49:24,906
I really tried.

1899
01:49:29,902 --> 01:49:31,265
I am sorry...

1900
01:49:34,838 --> 01:49:37,315
I'm sorry I couldn't love you.

1901
01:49:39,078 --> 01:49:40,264
I am sorry...

1902
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:01,328
You should have spoken to me...

1903
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:04,179
lam also like your mother.

1904
01:50:11,228 --> 01:50:11,999
Never mind...

1905
01:50:13,314 --> 01:50:14,534
What is the problem?

1906
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:26,215
I don't feel for Manav

1907
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:30,660
the way I am supposed to.

1908
01:50:31,388 --> 01:50:32,265
But...

1909
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:33,586
What is the problem?

1910
01:50:45,151 --> 01:50:47,450
We are not right for each other...

1911
01:50:49,774 --> 01:50:50,852
We are not compatible-

1912
01:50:50,921 --> 01:50:51,940
Not compatible? How?

1913
01:50:55,126 --> 01:50:56,109
You are both young,

1914
01:50:56,343 --> 01:50:57,220
successful,

1915
01:50:57,768 --> 01:50:58,396
Punjabi...

1916
01:50:58,464 --> 01:50:59,376
You both play squash.

1917
01:50:59,436 --> 01:51:00,314
Tennis.

1918
01:51:02,529 --> 01:51:03,442
Yes Papa, but...

1919
01:51:04,858 --> 01:51:06,743
We are still very different.

1920
01:51:08,021 --> 01:51:09,206
Manav is your husband

1921
01:51:09,273 --> 01:51:10,221
not your twin brother.

1922
01:51:12,888 --> 01:51:14,286
Has he ever hit you?

1923
01:51:15,042 --> 01:51:15,776
God!

1924
01:51:16,016 --> 01:51:16,964
No, Mom!

1925
01:51:18,657 --> 01:51:20,020
Is he stingy?

1926
01:51:22,515 --> 01:51:24,399
You don't let her shop?

1927
01:51:29,987 --> 01:51:31,658
Is he having an affair?

1928
01:51:32,733 --> 01:51:33,504
No!

1929
01:51:36,834 --> 01:51:39,027
Even Manav won't be happy with me.

1930
01:51:39,129 --> 01:51:40,421
That is my decision, Aysh.

1931
01:51:45,176 --> 01:51:47,131
Every marriage has problems.

1932
01:51:47,749 --> 01:51:51,648
Just have a baby,
everything will be fine.

1933
01:51:53,309 --> 01:51:54,566
You are right.

1934
01:51:55,777 --> 01:51:56,892
When you become a mother,

1935
01:51:58,767 --> 01:52:00,829
all these problems will go away.

1936
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:06,075
If I'm not happy in this relationship,

1937
01:52:06,308 --> 01:52:08,986
then having a baby...

1938
01:52:13,433 --> 01:52:14,868
It didn't feel right.

1939
01:52:19,078 --> 01:52:20,548
I've been on the pill.

1940
01:52:23,457 --> 01:52:24,299
What?

1941
01:52:27,628 --> 01:52:30,235
This is not the place
for this conversation.

1942
01:52:31,937 --> 01:52:32,779
Sorry...

1943
01:52:33,362 --> 01:52:34,133
You are right,

1944
01:52:35,101 --> 01:52:36,642
this is between Manav and me.

1945
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,719
We are family!

1946
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:41,775
We are here to celebrate
our anniversary.

1947
01:52:42,886 --> 01:52:45,293
What will our guests
think if they hear this?

1948
01:52:45,598 --> 01:52:47,068
Have you thought about that!

1949
01:52:49,003 --> 01:52:50,852
There has been no
divorce in this family

1950
01:52:51,436 --> 01:52:52,622
and there never will be.

1951
01:52:54,217 --> 01:52:55,722
You get that straight!

1952
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:07,219
Now tell me this won't
ever come up again.

1953
01:53:10,067 --> 01:53:11,217
I am talking to you, Ayesha.

1954
01:53:13,681 --> 01:53:14,416
Answer me!

1955
01:53:25,533 --> 01:53:26,648
I am sorry, Papa.

1956
01:53:28,105 --> 01:53:29,610
I can't do that.

1957
01:53:32,415 --> 01:53:33,920
So you're just going to leave?

1958
01:53:35,543 --> 01:53:37,498
Why are you doing this to us?

1959
01:53:39,123 --> 01:53:42,287
Don't think you can come back to us.

1960
01:53:45,241 --> 01:53:46,781
That is not your home anymore.

1961
01:53:49,724 --> 01:53:51,952
We are not going to
support this nonsense.

1962
01:54:02,445 --> 01:54:03,428
Okay.

1963
01:54:06,164 --> 01:54:07,242
Okay.

1964
01:54:12,525 --> 01:54:13,153
Okay.

1965
01:54:16,556 --> 01:54:17,220
Where are you going?

1966
01:54:17,773 --> 01:54:18,721
Ayesha!

1967
01:54:20,867 --> 01:54:21,365
Kabir.

1968
01:54:21,422 --> 01:54:22,405
Just go and get her.

1969
01:54:31,676 --> 01:54:32,754
Ya, Papa...

1970
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:34,634
lam looking...

1971
01:54:34,699 --> 01:54:36,370
I can't seem to find her.

1972
01:54:38,001 --> 01:54:38,772
Okay.

1973
01:54:46,134 --> 01:54:48,019
Yes, I am still looking.

1974
01:55:25,583 --> 01:55:26,567
Where is Ayesha?

1975
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:28,160
She is very upset.

1976
01:55:29,511 --> 01:55:30,246
She is upset?

1977
01:55:30,554 --> 01:55:31,076
Why?

1978
01:55:32,674 --> 01:55:36,289
Papa, how could you tell
her she can't come home?

1979
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:42,171
I'm doing this for her benefit.

1980
01:55:42,753 --> 01:55:44,223
It is for her own good.

1981
01:55:45,395 --> 01:55:46,686
If Ayesha is not welcome at home,

1982
01:55:46,751 --> 01:55:48,351
then I can't live there either.

1983
01:55:52,416 --> 01:55:53,186
What is this drama?

1984
01:55:53,458 --> 01:55:54,086
It's not drama.

1985
01:55:54,154 --> 01:55:55,897
Then what? Emotional blackmail?

1986
01:55:56,066 --> 01:55:57,144
Are you emotionally blackmailing me?

1987
01:55:57,212 --> 01:55:58,777
Think what you want...

1988
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:00,729
Then go...

1989
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:02,258
Get out.

1990
01:56:02,912 --> 01:56:04,477
Let's see how far you reach.

1991
01:56:05,936 --> 01:56:08,544
You can't even get a day's work done.

1992
01:56:12,367 --> 01:56:13,658
What have you done in life?

1993
01:56:13,861 --> 01:56:14,703
Tell me?

1994
01:56:15,703 --> 01:56:16,746
What do you have?

1995
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:17,972
Nothing!

1996
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:22,467
You are lucky, I am your father.

1997
01:56:23,502 --> 01:56:24,236
Go...

1998
01:56:24,615 --> 01:56:25,871
Try working outside.

1999
01:56:26,874 --> 01:56:29,067
You'll come to your
senses in two days.

2000
01:56:30,071 --> 01:56:31,433
Bloody idiot.

2001
01:56:45,629 --> 01:56:47,964
People say things
they don't mean in anger.

2002
01:56:49,696 --> 01:56:50,987
He was right...

2003
01:56:54,596 --> 01:56:56,231
What have I done?

2004
01:56:58,593 --> 01:57:00,264
What do I have?

2005
01:57:07,734 --> 01:57:09,097
You have this...

2006
01:57:10,932 --> 01:57:11,809
And this.

2007
01:57:14,269 --> 01:57:16,781
Take a decision from the heart.

2008
01:57:17,849 --> 01:57:19,555
Your mind will figure a way out.

2009
01:57:22,402 --> 01:57:23,729
Is it that simple?

2010
01:57:25,044 --> 01:57:25,399
No.

2011
01:57:26,573 --> 01:57:28,457
Some hard work is also required.

2012
01:57:31,404 --> 01:57:32,969
Will the soles of my shoes wear out?

2013
01:57:33,385 --> 01:57:33,907
What?

2014
01:57:40,441 --> 01:57:42,183
You're in love, baby!

2015
01:57:42,214 --> 01:57:42,948
Shut up...

2016
01:57:44,959 --> 01:57:46,358
You're in a bad space, man!

2017
01:57:50,207 --> 01:57:51,464
I won't ditch you.

2018
01:57:52,501 --> 01:57:53,616
As soon as the
engagement is announced,

2019
01:57:53,648 --> 01:57:55,010
I'll dump you.

2020
01:57:55,282 --> 01:57:56,503
Until then just...

2021
01:58:14,655 --> 01:58:15,876
Careful, please!

2022
01:58:19,381 --> 01:58:21,539
Sorry, didn't mean to ruin your plan.

2023
01:58:22,301 --> 01:58:23,344
What plan?

2024
01:58:24,456 --> 01:58:26,056
You were about to jump right?

2025
01:58:35,926 --> 01:58:37,491
Listen you were right...

2026
01:58:38,776 --> 01:58:40,767
I shouldn't have spoken
to Manav like that.

2027
01:58:42,391 --> 01:58:43,825
It was rude.

2028
01:58:44,858 --> 01:58:46,399
It's your marriage...

2029
01:58:47,326 --> 01:58:49,104
What is right or wrong

2030
01:58:49,585 --> 01:58:50,735
is none of my business.

2031
01:58:52,157 --> 01:58:53,343
Just wanted to say

2032
01:58:53,408 --> 01:58:55,151
I won't cross the line again.

2033
01:58:56,328 --> 01:58:57,620
I'm really sorry.

2034
01:59:07,902 --> 01:59:08,885
Friends?

2035
01:59:12,073 --> 01:59:12,915
I'd rather jump.

2036
01:59:18,607 --> 01:59:19,555
Come on, Pluto.

2037
01:59:20,172 --> 01:59:20,835
Come on, baby.

2038
01:59:23,682 --> 01:59:24,489
Come on!

2039
01:59:31,224 --> 01:59:32,824
I guess he wants to stay.

2040
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:50,351
Pluto...

2041
01:59:52,704 --> 01:59:54,897
You were supposed
to remind her of me...

2042
01:59:57,257 --> 01:59:58,763
What happened buddy?

2043
02:00:06,538 --> 02:00:08,600
Human beings are so strange...

2044
02:00:09,353 --> 02:00:11,510
The things they say to someone

2045
02:00:11,577 --> 02:00:13,699
are often meant for someone else.

2046
02:00:14,567 --> 02:00:17,873
And the conversation
they shy away from the most

2047
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:22,845
is of the heart, of love.

2048
02:00:23,291 --> 02:00:25,839
But it's the only thing that matters.

2049
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:29,549
Now how to explain to them

2050
02:00:29,616 --> 02:00:32,472
that if you love someone,

2051
02:00:32,779 --> 02:00:36,264
just show it.

2052
02:01:00,236 --> 02:01:03,342
There're no roads, near or far

2053
02:01:03,365 --> 02:01:06,470
Where a twist or a turn, is ever afar

2054
02:01:06,528 --> 02:01:09,278
This heart wants to let it go

2055
02:01:09,552 --> 02:01:12,408
These tatters, don't you try to sew

2056
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:15,466
The road we walk,

2057
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:18,565
Many a times, forks into two

2058
02:01:18,623 --> 02:01:21,657
At every step, we find the love,

2059
02:01:21,717 --> 02:01:25,331
At every other, it leaves us blue.

2060
02:01:25,401 --> 02:01:26,800
But still this life

2061
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:28,401
For even a second

2062
02:01:28,425 --> 02:01:30,902
Just doesn't stop

2063
02:01:31,171 --> 02:01:32,842
These waves of time

2064
02:01:32,908 --> 02:01:34,508
For even a second

2065
02:01:34,577 --> 02:01:36,734
Just doesn't stop

2066
02:01:36,801 --> 02:01:39,871
This loneliness...

2067
02:01:39,929 --> 02:01:45,179
becomes the air I breathe...

2068
02:01:48,236 --> 02:01:55,608
I know not, what to do...

2069
02:02:08,118 --> 02:02:14,174
These threads in a tangle,

2070
02:02:14,234 --> 02:02:18,999
These threads in a tangle,

2071
02:02:19,066 --> 02:02:22,965
Straighten them out...

2072
02:02:23,028 --> 02:02:27,864
Follow the heart, you dreamer

2073
02:02:27,929 --> 02:02:33,144
it tells the truth, have no doubt

2074
02:02:38,286 --> 02:02:44,343
There is a restlessness in my hopes;

2075
02:02:44,403 --> 02:02:49,060
A dream rests on shut eyes

2076
02:02:50,521 --> 02:02:56,364
This longing I had put to sleep,

2077
02:02:56,429 --> 02:03:02,035
Once again, is aching to rise

2078
02:03:02,443 --> 02:03:08,570
Which road you want to take...

2079
02:03:08,595 --> 02:03:14,757
why don't you know my crazy heart...

2080
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:16,072
But still this life

2081
02:03:16,136 --> 02:03:17,772
For even a second

2082
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,174
Just doesn't stop

2083
02:03:20,411 --> 02:03:22,225
These waves of time

2084
02:03:22,289 --> 02:03:23,924
For even a second

2085
02:03:23,957 --> 02:03:26,221
Just doesn't stop

2086
02:03:26,285 --> 02:03:29,284
This loneliness...

2087
02:03:29,344 --> 02:03:34,701
becomes the air I breathe...

2088
02:03:37,651 --> 02:03:43,980
I know not, what to do...

2089
02:03:48,112 --> 02:03:54,204
These threads in a tangle,

2090
02:03:54,404 --> 02:03:59,310
These threads in a tangle,

2091
02:03:59,374 --> 02:04:03,167
Straighten them out...

2092
02:04:03,441 --> 02:04:07,826
Follow the heart, you dreamer

2093
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:13,140
it tells the truth, have no doubt

2094
02:04:20,207 --> 02:04:22,270
This cruise is really costing a lot...

2095
02:04:22,744 --> 02:04:23,894
That Anju is an alcoholic!

2096
02:04:24,343 --> 02:04:26,891
She cans a crate of
champagne every evening.

2097
02:04:32,650 --> 02:04:33,598
What are you taking?

2098
02:04:36,265 --> 02:04:38,493
Something to help digest this bill.

2099
02:04:46,726 --> 02:04:49,132
Why don't you announce
Kabir's engagement?

2100
02:04:50,028 --> 02:04:53,063
Waiting on Sood's astrologer.

2101
02:04:53,122 --> 02:04:54,307
Can you believe it?

2102
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,884
No one is ready to believe

2103
02:04:58,161 --> 02:05:00,496
that Lalit Sood is
investing in our company.

2104
02:05:01,290 --> 02:05:03,518
This news will shut them up.

2105
02:05:15,992 --> 02:05:17,497
Did you tell lndu
about the engagement?

2106
02:05:17,556 --> 02:05:18,469
No!

2107
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:21,700
She can't keep anything
in her stomach.

2108
02:05:24,716 --> 02:05:26,873
Then it is time to
give her the good news...

2109
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:30,808
This Noorie...

2110
02:05:31,806 --> 02:05:32,825
is very smart.

2111
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:34,317
Why?

2112
02:05:37,472 --> 02:05:39,499
She has gone and conquered Kabir.

2113
02:05:41,469 --> 02:05:42,690
Kabir and Noorie?

2114
02:05:43,658 --> 02:05:45,199
I didn't say anything.

2115
02:05:46,717 --> 02:05:48,459
I'm just worried about Divya.

2116
02:05:48,524 --> 02:05:50,515
That girl needs to up her game.

2117
02:05:50,575 --> 02:05:52,839
How to dress, how to behave...

2118
02:05:53,737 --> 02:05:56,001
I was so impressed with your Rana...

2119
02:05:56,588 --> 02:05:59,135
But she went and vomited on him.

2120
02:05:59,959 --> 02:06:00,658
What?!

2121
02:06:01,801 --> 02:06:02,358
Yes...

2122
02:06:03,470 --> 02:06:05,425
That chapter is closed for me.

2123
02:06:05,868 --> 02:06:06,602
I am moving on.

2124
02:06:07,502 --> 02:06:08,688
What do you think about Sunny?

2125
02:06:09,309 --> 02:06:10,495
Very handsome

2126
02:06:11,395 --> 02:06:12,236
and different.

2127
02:06:12,576 --> 02:06:13,524
What is different?

2128
02:06:13,584 --> 02:06:15,919
All men want the same kind of wife.

2129
02:06:16,434 --> 02:06:17,761
I'll talk to Neelu Bhabhi.

2130
02:06:17,825 --> 02:06:19,081
About what?

2131
02:06:20,709 --> 02:06:23,909
<i>About Divya 8. Sunnis match...</i>

2132
02:06:28,495 --> 02:06:31,457
Isn't Divya a bit young?

2133
02:06:31,519 --> 02:06:32,633
What is young?

2134
02:06:33,082 --> 02:06:35,453
At her age, your mother had two kids.

2135
02:06:36,316 --> 02:06:36,778
Talk to Neelu na.

2136
02:06:36,836 --> 02:06:38,899
Tell Prem to talk to Amrish.

2137
02:06:39,617 --> 02:06:41,607
Sunny is quite a famous
journalist, I hear.

2138
02:06:41,668 --> 02:06:42,367
I know.

2139
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:44,068
Divya will get a chance to travel-

2140
02:06:44,135 --> 02:06:46,683
Don't you all have
anything better to do?

2141
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:47,899
Please!

2142
02:06:48,168 --> 02:06:50,123
Leave your kids alone

2143
02:06:50,183 --> 02:06:51,961
and get a life.

2144
02:06:53,138 --> 02:06:54,050
Get a job!

2145
02:07:01,549 --> 02:07:02,699
Has she gone mad?

2146
02:07:03,773 --> 02:07:05,338
Who will give us a job?

2147
02:07:10,551 --> 02:07:11,215
Yes...

2148
02:07:14,930 --> 02:07:15,772
Yes yes, coming.

2149
02:07:18,093 --> 02:07:18,792
Hey!

2150
02:07:18,857 --> 02:07:22,128
Those hags are plotting
your marriage to Divya.

2151
02:07:23,272 --> 02:07:23,699
What?

2152
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:24,802
Yup...

2153
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:25,707
You heard me.

2154
02:07:26,712 --> 02:07:28,277
I like what you are wearing,
by the way.

2155
02:07:31,023 --> 02:07:32,066
So... With Divya?

2156
02:07:32,969 --> 02:07:33,846
Please, Sunny.

2157
02:07:34,985 --> 02:07:36,171
What is their plan?

2158
02:07:36,515 --> 02:07:37,593
It's not a joke.

2159
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,750
Don't encourage them.

2160
02:07:39,816 --> 02:07:41,356
If they ask, just say no.

2161
02:07:41,415 --> 02:07:42,955
Just... No!

2162
02:07:43,396 --> 02:07:44,379
Why?

2163
02:07:44,474 --> 02:07:46,358
I don't even know Divya...

2164
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,410
She could be a very nice girl.

2165
02:07:49,131 --> 02:07:50,388
She is my cousin!

2166
02:07:50,486 --> 02:07:51,328
So?

2167
02:07:51,564 --> 02:07:52,298
Why do you care?

2168
02:07:52,364 --> 02:07:53,655
You're already married.

2169
02:07:55,874 --> 02:07:58,067
I wouldn't be, if we were together.

2170
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:07,773
We would be, if you had waited.

2171
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:15,375
But you jumped on the
first guy that came by.

2172
02:08:15,790 --> 02:08:17,224
It was very nice of you.

2173
02:08:19,856 --> 02:08:20,804
How dare you?

2174
02:08:20,865 --> 02:08:21,742
What are you doing?

2175
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:24,031
I jumped on the first guy?

2176
02:08:24,097 --> 02:08:24,796
'I Jumped!

2177
02:08:24,861 --> 02:08:26,082
You really want to
talk about this right now?

2178
02:08:26,147 --> 02:08:27,711
Yes I think it's high time, don't you?

2179
02:08:29,657 --> 02:08:31,020
You didn't want to tell your parents.

2180
02:08:31,082 --> 02:08:32,789
They would've never accepted it

2181
02:08:32,855 --> 02:08:34,041
and you know that.

2182
02:08:34,350 --> 02:08:35,606
So what was your plan...

2183
02:08:35,879 --> 02:08:36,472
That we run away?

2184
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:37,487
What else could we have done?

2185
02:08:37,548 --> 02:08:38,591
Are you crazy?

2186
02:08:39,042 --> 02:08:40,748
How would my father
have faced your parents?

2187
02:08:40,815 --> 02:08:43,362
And what would they think of me?

2188
02:08:43,526 --> 02:08:44,711
They knew about us.

2189
02:08:44,777 --> 02:08:45,583
Please.

2190
02:08:45,854 --> 02:08:47,075
What do you think, Sunny?

2191
02:08:47,487 --> 02:08:49,573
Why did Papa send you to America?

2192
02:08:50,443 --> 02:08:53,299
Not to study but to
keep you away from me!

2193
02:08:54,578 --> 02:08:55,242
Did he tell you that?

2194
02:08:55,308 --> 02:08:56,351
Obviously not.

2195
02:08:56,421 --> 02:08:57,369
Then how do you know?

2196
02:08:57,428 --> 02:08:58,471
Because I know my father!

2197
02:08:58,749 --> 02:08:59,483
Ayesha!

2198
02:08:59,549 --> 02:09:00,592
Then please tell me...

2199
02:09:01,008 --> 02:09:04,007
How did he convince
you to marry Manav?

2200
02:09:04,763 --> 02:09:06,718
He didn't need to...

2201
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:08,593
Because you did it.

2202
02:09:10,915 --> 02:09:12,870
You know,
Ayesha that is really convenient.

2203
02:09:13,451 --> 02:09:15,122
Everyone is at fault, except you.

2204
02:09:16,893 --> 02:09:17,734
Do you remember...

2205
02:09:18,248 --> 02:09:19,753
How many times I called you?

2206
02:09:20,403 --> 02:09:21,446
I kept telling you

2207
02:09:21,724 --> 02:09:23,265
my parents are pressurizing me...

2208
02:09:23,322 --> 02:09:25,028
Please come back, please come back...

2209
02:09:25,095 --> 02:09:26,138
Why didn't you come back, Sunny?

2210
02:09:26,207 --> 02:09:26,634
Ayesha!

2211
02:09:26,902 --> 02:09:29,580
I am your father's manager's son!

2212
02:09:31,247 --> 02:09:32,788
I wanted to be somebody.

2213
02:09:33,506 --> 02:09:35,664
Somebody your parents would accept.

2214
02:09:35,730 --> 02:09:36,880
Don't you get it?

2215
02:09:41,222 --> 02:09:43,249
And why are we talking about this now?

2216
02:09:44,802 --> 02:09:46,094
Manav is great.

2217
02:09:46,297 --> 02:09:47,411
You are happy-

2218
02:09:48,069 --> 02:09:50,131
What is the point of this-

2219
02:10:12,817 --> 02:10:16,372
This is the best place for seafood...

2220
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:18,213
You like fishes?

2221
02:10:18,655 --> 02:10:20,196
You will love them.

2222
02:10:22,235 --> 02:10:23,183
No fishes for you!

2223
02:10:23,244 --> 02:10:24,749
You're coming with me to King's Bar.

2224
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:27,625
I want you to meet Farah.

2225
02:10:30,021 --> 02:10:30,649
Farah?

2226
02:10:31,828 --> 02:10:32,906
Don't be late.

2227
02:10:33,566 --> 02:10:34,372
I am serious.

2228
02:10:36,417 --> 02:10:37,459
You alright?

2229
02:10:37,736 --> 02:10:38,435
Yeah.

2230
02:10:38,502 --> 02:10:39,485
I'll see you there.

2231
02:10:41,282 --> 02:10:42,468
I am coming to King's Bar.

2232
02:10:43,194 --> 02:10:44,142
Divya, please.

2233
02:10:44,202 --> 02:10:45,767
Champagne or me.

2234
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:46,749
Please choose one.

2235
02:10:46,808 --> 02:10:47,827
Shut up!

2236
02:10:47,886 --> 02:10:49,451
Don't be mean, Rana.

2237
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,563
What was that?

2238
02:10:56,505 --> 02:10:57,761
It was nothing.

2239
02:10:59,217 --> 02:11:00,817
Don't mess with me, Ayesha...

2240
02:11:01,650 --> 02:11:02,456
You have no idea how difficult it was

2241
02:11:02,727 --> 02:11:04,054
for me to see you again.

2242
02:11:04,118 --> 02:11:05,409
So why did you come?

2243
02:11:05,473 --> 02:11:06,623
What choice did I have?

2244
02:11:07,941 --> 02:11:10,524
Papa was behaving like
it's his last holiday.

2245
02:11:11,799 --> 02:11:12,570
Papa?

2246
02:11:13,432 --> 02:11:14,274
Ya...

2247
02:11:15,796 --> 02:11:17,360
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

2248
02:11:17,985 --> 02:11:18,863
I am sorry.

2249
02:11:19,098 --> 02:11:20,141
So, is that it?

2250
02:11:20,175 --> 02:11:21,846
Yes, that's it.

2251
02:11:21,913 --> 02:11:24,698
Go... Live your bachelor
life with your girlfriends.

2252
02:11:24,764 --> 02:11:25,711
Do your thing.

2253
02:11:27,335 --> 02:11:28,354
Is that what you think?

2254
02:11:28,413 --> 02:11:30,925
That's what I hear,
so that's what I think.

2255
02:11:32,549 --> 02:11:35,132
How can someone so smart be so stupid?

2256
02:11:56,357 --> 02:11:57,305
Sure you don't want anything?

2257
02:11:57,643 --> 02:11:58,449
Some poison?

2258
02:11:59,103 --> 02:11:59,660
A slap?

2259
02:11:59,694 --> 02:12:01,164
Here you all are!

2260
02:12:01,362 --> 02:12:03,105
Hi!

2261
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:04,391
Come on, dinner is served.

2262
02:12:04,455 --> 02:12:05,368
Let's go.

2263
02:12:05,429 --> 02:12:07,278
We are not hungry,

2264
02:12:07,341 --> 02:12:09,047
in fact we are all
working up an appetite.

2265
02:12:09,612 --> 02:12:10,311
Very good.

2266
02:12:10,343 --> 02:12:11,184
Really?

2267
02:12:12,185 --> 02:12:13,655
Kabir...

2268
02:12:13,715 --> 02:12:15,279
You sneaky boy!

2269
02:12:15,696 --> 02:12:16,846
When is the big day?

2270
02:12:17,538 --> 02:12:19,351
Sorry... What big day?

2271
02:12:19,935 --> 02:12:21,926
Nice acting, Ayesha!

2272
02:12:22,056 --> 02:12:23,171
We know all about it...

2273
02:12:23,411 --> 02:12:24,917
He is getting married!

2274
02:12:25,705 --> 02:12:26,724
You're getting married?

2275
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,183
To whom?

2276
02:12:28,625 --> 02:12:29,740
To her!

2277
02:12:31,197 --> 02:12:32,039
Kabir...

2278
02:12:32,101 --> 02:12:34,021
Nothing like that, Saira Aunty...

2279
02:12:34,291 --> 02:12:35,441
Who told you?

2280
02:12:35,507 --> 02:12:36,977
Your lndu Aunty!

2281
02:12:37,036 --> 02:12:39,751
No engagement,
they're directly planning the wedding.

2282
02:12:39,817 --> 02:12:40,516
What?

2283
02:12:40,581 --> 02:12:41,565
Come on, let's celebrate!

2284
02:12:41,624 --> 02:12:42,702
I think it's very good they're not

2285
02:12:42,771 --> 02:12:44,371
bothering with an engagement.

2286
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:45,554
It's a waste of time.

2287
02:12:46,525 --> 02:12:51,325
Don't do it guys, it's a trap!

2288
02:12:55,353 --> 02:12:56,468
Farah!

2289
02:12:57,543 --> 02:12:58,314
Farah...

2290
02:12:58,377 --> 02:12:59,633
Please just stop.

2291
02:12:59,663 --> 02:13:00,610
Please!

2292
02:13:03,208 --> 02:13:04,121
Are you okay?

2293
02:13:04,181 --> 02:13:05,094
No.

2294
02:13:05,154 --> 02:13:06,232
I am not okay.

2295
02:13:06,857 --> 02:13:07,592
What was that?

2296
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:10,412
Look I am really sorry...
I have no idea.

2297
02:13:10,577 --> 02:13:13,054
You people don't talk
to each other or what?

2298
02:13:14,748 --> 02:13:15,696
You're getting married?

2299
02:13:15,755 --> 02:13:16,632
No babe...

2300
02:13:16,937 --> 02:13:17,921
It's a long story.

2301
02:13:17,980 --> 02:13:18,928
I am not deaf, Kabir.

2302
02:13:18,987 --> 02:13:20,766
I heard what your Aunties said.

2303
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:22,229
Please hear me out too?

2304
02:13:23,228 --> 02:13:25,112
It's true that Noorie
& I are getting engaged...

2305
02:13:25,175 --> 02:13:26,325
but there is a reason for that-

2306
02:13:26,391 --> 02:13:27,505
Farah, please wait!

2307
02:13:28,129 --> 02:13:29,315
I am not getting married!

2308
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:30,779
Go tell Noorie that you asshole!

2309
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:31,788
Farah, please just listen-

2310
02:13:31,848 --> 02:13:32,831
To what?!

2311
02:13:33,899 --> 02:13:35,926
We met, I liked you,
we had a fun time.

2312
02:13:36,089 --> 02:13:36,930
I was fine.

2313
02:13:37,722 --> 02:13:39,677
Then this I love you,
I want to be with you...

2314
02:13:39,737 --> 02:13:42,179
What was the need to lie?

2315
02:13:43,283 --> 02:13:45,441
You made an arse of me, Kabir.

2316
02:13:52,250 --> 02:13:53,435
What's going on?

2317
02:13:53,710 --> 02:13:54,481
Nothing...

2318
02:13:54,544 --> 02:13:56,179
Noorie meets Rana, not me.

2319
02:13:56,247 --> 02:13:57,468
They are together.

2320
02:13:57,811 --> 02:13:59,625
I was trying to help them out.

2321
02:13:59,689 --> 02:14:00,044
The next thing I know,

2322
02:14:00,071 --> 02:14:02,892
Papa was bribing me
with the plane to marry her.

2323
02:14:03,059 --> 02:14:04,600
And you said yes?

2324
02:14:04,728 --> 02:14:05,711
Are you stupid?

2325
02:14:05,771 --> 02:14:06,921
What about them?

2326
02:14:07,578 --> 02:14:08,905
These are our parents?

2327
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:11,784
Am I an asset?

2328
02:14:12,166 --> 02:14:13,386
I thought I'd teach them a lesson.

2329
02:14:13,452 --> 02:14:15,017
If they can use me for the company,

2330
02:14:15,085 --> 02:14:17,076
I can use them for my plane.

2331
02:14:17,415 --> 02:14:19,264
So what's the difference
between you and them?

2332
02:14:19,326 --> 02:14:19,681
Ayesha, please!

2333
02:14:19,743 --> 02:14:20,821
Cut out the moral science.

2334
02:14:20,855 --> 02:14:22,526
You would've done the same thing.

2335
02:14:22,593 --> 02:14:23,992
No! I wouldn't.

2336
02:14:24,922 --> 02:14:27,007
If I don't agree with them,
I tell them.

2337
02:14:27,077 --> 02:14:28,025
Oh really?

2338
02:14:28,084 --> 02:14:29,791
Did you tell them about the card?

2339
02:14:29,857 --> 02:14:30,841
Kabir!

2340
02:14:31,039 --> 02:14:32,888
That was not important.

2341
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:35,177
Can you please just grow up?

2342
02:14:36,114 --> 02:14:37,156
What are you doing?

2343
02:14:38,059 --> 02:14:40,015
What do you want to do?

2344
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:41,468
Think.

2345
02:14:50,433 --> 02:14:51,998
We are not getting married!

2346
02:14:52,449 --> 02:14:53,811
There's been some confusion.

2347
02:14:54,014 --> 02:14:54,891
Don't you trust me?

2348
02:14:54,952 --> 02:14:56,102
I don't know, you are a Sood.

2349
02:14:56,168 --> 02:14:57,151
What is that supposed to mean?!

2350
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:58,017
You know what I mean!

2351
02:14:58,253 --> 02:15:00,067
You know the problem
between our families.

2352
02:15:00,166 --> 02:15:01,908
What problem?

2353
02:15:01,973 --> 02:15:03,964
Your aunt was engaged to my uncle

2354
02:15:03,989 --> 02:15:05,695
and one day before
the wedding she eloped.

2355
02:15:05,970 --> 02:15:07,605
That's because your sleazy uncle

2356
02:15:07,673 --> 02:15:09,451
was having an affair
with his secretary.

2357
02:15:09,515 --> 02:15:11,185
Watch your tongue, she's my aunt now.

2358
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:13,280
And she didn't buy my uncle,

2359
02:15:13,339 --> 02:15:15,401
like your dad is buying
Kamal Uncle for you.

2360
02:15:25,885 --> 02:15:28,363
Please classify my account...

2361
02:15:28,423 --> 02:15:29,335
Okay.

2362
02:15:41,144 --> 02:15:41,772
What?

2363
02:15:41,839 --> 02:15:42,573
Shhh!

2364
02:15:53,448 --> 02:15:54,431
Shit!

2365
02:15:57,201 --> 02:15:58,244
This is too much.

2366
02:15:58,314 --> 02:15:59,392
Where were you?

2367
02:15:59,913 --> 02:16:00,955
I got a call from Delhi.

2368
02:16:01,233 --> 02:16:02,348
Sit Kamal.

2369
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:03,044
lndu...

2370
02:16:03,667 --> 02:16:04,473
Have you seen Prem?

2371
02:16:04,674 --> 02:16:06,144
I don't see him after 10 pm.

2372
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:08,811
Don't tell me. He sleeps that early?

2373
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,686
Yes...

2374
02:16:09,749 --> 02:16:11,776
And I'm the queen of the night.

2375
02:16:11,973 --> 02:16:14,095
Tell Neelu I went back to the ship.

2376
02:16:14,302 --> 02:16:15,073
Kamal Ji...

2377
02:16:15,379 --> 02:16:16,849
Please take Putlu with you.

2378
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:18,129
Come.

2379
02:16:18,577 --> 02:16:19,490
Why?

2380
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:21,091
It's getting late.

2381
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:23,207
Good night, everybody.

2382
02:16:23,825 --> 02:16:24,702
Good night, bye!

2383
02:16:25,598 --> 02:16:26,369
Kabir!

2384
02:16:30,707 --> 02:16:32,829
Kamal Uncle saw Rana & me together...

2385
02:16:34,218 --> 02:16:35,166
So?

2386
02:16:38,041 --> 02:16:40,068
What were you both doing?

2387
02:16:47,043 --> 02:16:48,299
I'll handle it.

2388
02:16:51,561 --> 02:16:52,439
And Noorie...

2389
02:16:53,403 --> 02:16:55,560
There are 500 rooms on the ship.

2390
02:17:10,677 --> 02:17:11,554
What happened?

2391
02:17:12,346 --> 02:17:13,460
Don't ask...

2392
02:17:15,404 --> 02:17:16,447
Are you okay?

2393
02:17:17,177 --> 02:17:17,948
Get me some water.

2394
02:17:18,464 --> 02:17:19,376
Ya, sure.

2395
02:17:22,565 --> 02:17:23,679
Can I get some water?

2396
02:17:23,746 --> 02:17:24,101
Sure.

2397
02:17:30,489 --> 02:17:31,472
Kamal Uncle!

2398
02:17:33,374 --> 02:17:34,037
Sir!

2399
02:17:34,417 --> 02:17:36,301
Sir, are you okay?

2400
02:17:39,873 --> 02:17:40,715
Call the ship...

2401
02:17:40,916 --> 02:17:42,456
Tell them to open the medical centre.

2402
02:17:42,932 --> 02:17:44,438
He may be having a heart attack!

2403
02:17:44,461 --> 02:17:45,339
Hurry UP!

2404
02:17:47,728 --> 02:17:48,711
Don't complain...

2405
02:17:49,049 --> 02:17:50,684
You are the luckiest out of the lot!

2406
02:17:50,892 --> 02:17:52,670
I totally agree!

2407
02:17:55,479 --> 02:17:56,285
Hello...

2408
02:17:57,391 --> 02:17:58,339
Hello?

2409
02:18:00,172 --> 02:18:01,084
Yes?

2410
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:14,919
How is he?

2411
02:18:15,777 --> 02:18:16,725
We don't know...

2412
02:18:17,967 --> 02:18:19,258
Kabir, it's all my fault...

2413
02:18:19,323 --> 02:18:20,887
He was already so stressed and I...

2414
02:18:20,956 --> 02:18:22,426
It wasn't you...

2415
02:18:29,194 --> 02:18:30,272
What happened?

2416
02:18:32,634 --> 02:18:33,997
The doctor is with him...

2417
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:40,153
He's been on anti-anxiety
pills for a few months.

2418
02:18:43,374 --> 02:18:44,808
I didn't even know.

2419
02:18:47,232 --> 02:18:48,109
Come here.

2420
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:26,512
There is nothing to worry about.

2421
02:19:27,029 --> 02:19:29,115
It's a severe case of gas.

2422
02:19:30,157 --> 02:19:32,315
We've given him something
for the heartburn.

2423
02:19:32,591 --> 02:19:34,261
He'll be fine in a few minutes.

2424
02:19:35,093 --> 02:19:36,076
Excuse me.

2425
02:19:55,148 --> 02:19:58,110
You have no idea
what I've been through.

2426
02:20:04,254 --> 02:20:06,139
What you've been through?

2427
02:20:09,224 --> 02:20:10,207
You!

2428
02:20:10,579 --> 02:20:11,385
What are you doing?

2429
02:20:11,449 --> 02:20:12,291
Stop it!

2430
02:20:12,352 --> 02:20:13,395
You?!

2431
02:20:13,429 --> 02:20:14,650
Stop it!

2432
02:20:16,141 --> 02:20:17,919
Have you ever thought about me?

2433
02:20:19,165 --> 02:20:20,634
Should I keep living with the fear

2434
02:20:20,694 --> 02:20:22,164
that you will leave me.

2435
02:20:30,286 --> 02:20:31,649
Yes, one minute.

2436
02:20:37,829 --> 02:20:38,742
Come in.

2437
02:20:42,834 --> 02:20:43,984
You Okay?

2438
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:45,519
Ya, top of the world!

2439
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:46,102
Mom...

2440
02:20:47,734 --> 02:20:49,061
You scared us, Papa.

2441
02:20:50,064 --> 02:20:51,806
I'm glad you are fine.

2442
02:20:57,154 --> 02:20:58,067
Listen...

2443
02:21:01,255 --> 02:21:02,998
Please forget this Noorie...

2444
02:21:03,827 --> 02:21:04,669
What?

2445
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:06,373
Why?

2446
02:21:06,469 --> 02:21:08,661
She is not serious about Kabir,
trust me.

2447
02:21:08,728 --> 02:21:09,914
Meaning?

2448
02:21:10,049 --> 02:21:12,764
We've given our word to the Soods.

2449
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:15,098
Sorry...

2450
02:21:16,235 --> 02:21:18,120
Sorry for everything.

2451
02:21:20,198 --> 02:21:22,011
Don't be sorry, Papa.

2452
02:21:25,133 --> 02:21:27,717
Actually I never planned
to marry Noorie...

2453
02:21:31,842 --> 02:21:34,141
I know about her & Rana...

2454
02:21:36,568 --> 02:21:38,038
Noorie, with Rana?

2455
02:21:39,105 --> 02:21:40,183
She likes him.

2456
02:21:40,252 --> 02:21:42,172
They are together...

2457
02:21:43,068 --> 02:21:45,153
I was just helping them out.

2458
02:21:46,404 --> 02:21:48,218
So, I'm sorry.

2459
02:21:49,254 --> 02:21:50,202
You are sorry?

2460
02:21:51,409 --> 02:21:52,524
That's it, you are sorry?

2461
02:21:52,592 --> 02:21:53,954
What is the meaning of sorry now?

2462
02:21:54,899 --> 02:21:55,977
This isn't a joke.

2463
02:21:56,046 --> 02:21:58,168
This is a very serious matter.

2464
02:21:58,374 --> 02:22:00,531
Yes, of course it's serious...

2465
02:22:00,599 --> 02:22:02,756
For you it's a business deal, right?

2466
02:22:02,823 --> 02:22:04,423
It's not just our business,

2467
02:22:04,666 --> 02:22:05,708
it's yours too.

2468
02:22:07,272 --> 02:22:08,422
It isn't mine...

2469
02:22:09,705 --> 02:22:11,590
And I don't want it.

2470
02:22:11,617 --> 02:22:13,288
What do you mean you don't want it?

2471
02:22:21,071 --> 02:22:23,442
Now that he is fine
and we are talking,

2472
02:22:23,503 --> 02:22:25,174
let's talk openly...

2473
02:22:29,273 --> 02:22:31,536
I don't want to be the CEO of Ayka.

2474
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:35,575
I am not good enough.

2475
02:22:36,954 --> 02:22:38,246
I know that.

2476
02:22:38,935 --> 02:22:39,634
You will learn.

2477
02:22:39,666 --> 02:22:40,708
I won't be able to.

2478
02:22:41,821 --> 02:22:43,848
I don't have what it takes.

2479
02:22:44,010 --> 02:22:45,373
Then what will you do?

2480
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:46,902
I like flying...

2481
02:22:48,042 --> 02:22:50,032
I want to do something in that field.

2482
02:22:50,475 --> 02:22:51,660
And our business?

2483
02:22:52,386 --> 02:22:53,678
Should we sell Ayka to someone else?

2484
02:22:53,742 --> 02:22:54,476
No...

2485
02:22:55,549 --> 02:22:59,413
Give it to that Mehra
who has his business acumen.

2486
02:22:59,755 --> 02:23:01,569
Who deserves it, who is worthy of it.

2487
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:03,138
It's called Ayka, right?

2488
02:23:03,196 --> 02:23:04,179
Ayesha-Kabir.

2489
02:23:05,177 --> 02:23:07,132
So if you want to save your company

2490
02:23:07,193 --> 02:23:08,414
let your son go

2491
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:10,150
and bring your daughter back home.

2492
02:23:10,217 --> 02:23:11,235
What rubbish!

2493
02:23:12,476 --> 02:23:13,626
She is in her home.

2494
02:23:13,693 --> 02:23:15,020
She is miserable.

2495
02:23:15,082 --> 02:23:16,197
Can't you guys see that?

2496
02:23:16,265 --> 02:23:17,699
Don't you care?

2497
02:23:17,759 --> 02:23:18,672
Of course we care!

2498
02:23:19,289 --> 02:23:21,351
But do you know what
divorce means in our society?

2499
02:23:21,374 --> 02:23:22,524
It's not easy.

2500
02:23:23,355 --> 02:23:25,654
So if I am about to
do something difficult,

2501
02:23:26,830 --> 02:23:29,545
you should be even
more supportive, right?

2502
02:23:30,028 --> 02:23:31,320
What are you talking, Ayesha?

2503
02:23:32,774 --> 02:23:33,722
If you do all this,

2504
02:23:34,199 --> 02:23:35,977
people will talk. You know that.

2505
02:23:36,458 --> 02:23:38,236
They are doing that anyway,
aren't they?

2506
02:23:38,474 --> 02:23:39,659
Whether something happens or not,

2507
02:23:40,455 --> 02:23:41,498
that is what people do-

2508
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,718
What are these two saying?

2509
02:23:43,653 --> 02:23:45,359
I just don't understand this girl.

2510
02:23:45,426 --> 02:23:46,789
The problem, Neelam...

2511
02:23:46,851 --> 02:23:48,416
is that the morality & values we had,

2512
02:23:48,484 --> 02:23:49,811
don't exist any more.

2513
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:51,616
Marriage has become a joke.

2514
02:23:52,099 --> 02:23:53,118
Get married today,

2515
02:23:53,176 --> 02:23:54,646
divorced tomorrow!

2516
02:23:56,061 --> 02:23:56,832
Really?

2517
02:23:59,016 --> 02:24:01,386
Since when have you been married?

2518
02:24:04,195 --> 02:24:08,094
And what is your morality
and what are your values?

2519
02:24:08,156 --> 02:24:08,749
Please tell us.

2520
02:24:08,817 --> 02:24:09,587
Stop it, Kabir!

2521
02:24:09,651 --> 02:24:10,634
Oh, its true.

2522
02:24:12,501 --> 02:24:14,943
Everyone knows about
his business trips.

2523
02:24:17,993 --> 02:24:20,115
Where he goes,
who he goes with, what he does

2524
02:24:20,182 --> 02:24:22,245
and how you pretend
nothing has happened.

2525
02:24:22,303 --> 02:24:23,381
Whereas the truth is

2526
02:24:23,450 --> 02:24:25,513
you have nowhere else to go...

2527
02:24:36,727 --> 02:24:37,913
How dare you?

2528
02:24:38,882 --> 02:24:40,032
It's the truth.

2529
02:24:44,651 --> 02:24:45,564
Please leave.

2530
02:24:45,764 --> 02:24:46,605
No.

2531
02:24:46,806 --> 02:24:48,371
Just get out of here.

2532
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:50,146
I am not going anywhere.

2533
02:24:50,212 --> 02:24:51,919
Is this how you speak to your father?

2534
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:53,242
I am talking to you too.

2535
02:24:53,271 --> 02:24:54,598
Don't talk to me, Kabir.

2536
02:24:54,661 --> 02:24:55,432
Shut up!

2537
02:24:55,496 --> 02:24:56,230
No!

2538
02:24:56,295 --> 02:24:57,337
I don't want to see your face!

2539
02:24:57,407 --> 02:24:58,628
I am not going any where.

2540
02:25:00,535 --> 02:25:02,563
Everyone in this
family talks in circles.

2541
02:25:02,621 --> 02:25:04,505
Nothing real is ever said.

2542
02:25:04,567 --> 02:25:05,717
What do you want to say?

2543
02:25:08,981 --> 02:25:11,731
What more is left to say?

2544
02:25:14,855 --> 02:25:16,076
I'm in love with Farah.

2545
02:25:16,142 --> 02:25:19,033
She's a dancer and she's a Muslim.

2546
02:25:51,594 --> 02:25:52,815
I need to talk to you.

2547
02:25:55,069 --> 02:25:56,740
Farah please... I need to talk to you.

2548
02:25:56,807 --> 02:25:57,614
Not here.

2549
02:25:57,641 --> 02:25:58,719
Then where?

2550
02:25:58,787 --> 02:25:59,250
Back off man.

2551
02:25:59,309 --> 02:26:00,945
Don't mess with me right now!

2552
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:05,461
Listen, I am sorry.

2553
02:26:05,531 --> 02:26:06,550
I screwed up, okay?

2554
02:26:08,207 --> 02:26:10,293
I was never going to marry Noorie,

2555
02:26:10,363 --> 02:26:12,390
I was just playing
a stupid game with my Dad.

2556
02:26:12,517 --> 02:26:13,773
Please, I am sorry.

2557
02:26:16,341 --> 02:26:17,419
I love you.

2558
02:26:24,751 --> 02:26:27,015
These games are best
played with your dad.

2559
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:28,336
This is my place of work...

2560
02:26:28,401 --> 02:26:29,551
Get out!

2561
02:26:51,028 --> 02:26:52,806
They hate us...

2562
02:26:56,310 --> 02:26:59,273
No... I don't think they hate us.

2563
02:26:59,334 --> 02:27:00,555
Why didn't you leave me?

2564
02:27:10,492 --> 02:27:11,819
You heard Kabir...

2565
02:27:14,975 --> 02:27:17,132
I had nowhere to go.

2566
02:27:25,576 --> 02:27:27,733
Will you be able to forgive me?

2567
02:27:37,984 --> 02:27:39,975
You forgot me, Kamal.

2568
02:27:49,558 --> 02:27:50,601
I'm sorry.

2569
02:27:51,783 --> 02:27:52,696
I'm really sorry.

2570
02:27:52,756 --> 02:27:54,747
I never forgot you, Neelu

2571
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:56,728
Never.

2572
02:28:02,488 --> 02:28:04,716
Why do human beings forget to tell

2573
02:28:04,782 --> 02:28:07,366
each other things
when they are together?

2574
02:28:10,308 --> 02:28:11,979
And why is it

2575
02:28:12,568 --> 02:28:17,890
that they always remember
the unsaid things

2576
02:28:18,928 --> 02:28:20,564
when someone is gone?

2577
02:28:22,369 --> 02:28:24,810
Why does the right
thing only come to them

2578
02:28:25,463 --> 02:28:27,241
when its too late?

2579
02:28:33,318 --> 02:28:34,858
Everyone is gossiping...

2580
02:28:35,994 --> 02:28:38,021
This girl doesn't care about herself

2581
02:28:38,288 --> 02:28:40,315
or her family's reputation.

2582
02:28:41,311 --> 02:28:43,682
Why have I lived to see this day?

2583
02:28:44,614 --> 02:28:46,676
All these years we invested in her...

2584
02:28:47,394 --> 02:28:48,934
Invested in me means?

2585
02:28:49,861 --> 02:28:51,604
Did I say something wrong?

2586
02:28:52,017 --> 02:28:53,273
Did I upset you?

2587
02:28:54,136 --> 02:28:55,677
Are you angry?

2588
02:28:55,979 --> 02:28:56,643
Tell me?

2589
02:28:57,126 --> 02:28:57,790
Tell me...

2590
02:28:58,725 --> 02:29:01,510
I'm not allowed to
speak in my own house.

2591
02:29:01,922 --> 02:29:03,178
So you only say something...

2592
02:29:03,973 --> 02:29:05,158
Why are you quiet?

2593
02:29:06,024 --> 02:29:06,652
Okay, fine.

2594
02:29:07,067 --> 02:29:09,189
If I upset you, then please...

2595
02:29:09,465 --> 02:29:10,507
Please forgive me.

2596
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:13,812
İf this is not good enough,
then I will-

2597
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:16,104
I will kill myself!

2598
02:29:16,694 --> 02:29:17,879
Will that make you happy?

2599
02:29:17,945 --> 02:29:18,751
Mom, please-

2600
02:29:19,926 --> 02:29:20,660
Manav...

2601
02:29:21,873 --> 02:29:23,058
This is what she wants!

2602
02:29:23,506 --> 02:29:24,383
Smita ji...

2603
02:29:25,870 --> 02:29:26,392
Aunty...

2604
02:29:28,199 --> 02:29:29,669
That's a butter knife.

2605
02:29:30,249 --> 02:29:31,091
What?

2606
02:29:31,778 --> 02:29:33,414
That is a butter knife.

2607
02:29:34,177 --> 02:29:34,983
Kabir!

2608
02:29:35,462 --> 02:29:36,577
Take this.

2609
02:29:36,645 --> 02:29:37,759
This will be better.

2610
02:29:39,043 --> 02:29:40,442
Hold it like this...

2611
02:29:40,850 --> 02:29:42,664
And cut like this.

2612
02:29:42,727 --> 02:29:43,225
Lengthwise.

2613
02:29:44,256 --> 02:29:47,077
How dare you speak
to my mother like that?

2614
02:29:47,767 --> 02:29:48,917
I am just helping her-

2615
02:29:48,983 --> 02:29:49,410
Kabir!

2616
02:29:50,791 --> 02:29:51,905
Apologize.

2617
02:29:53,328 --> 02:29:54,134
Now.

2618
02:29:54,996 --> 02:29:55,553
Sorry...

2619
02:29:58,090 --> 02:29:59,796
This is ridiculous!

2620
02:30:00,731 --> 02:30:01,952
This is my marriage.

2621
02:30:02,712 --> 02:30:04,632
And this is my family's
personal matter.

2622
02:30:06,083 --> 02:30:07,102
I have had enough.

2623
02:30:07,508 --> 02:30:08,030
Mom.

2624
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:09,317
We should go back.

2625
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:10,365
Come on.

2626
02:30:11,019 --> 02:30:12,346
Ayesha, pack up your bags... Let's go.

2627
02:30:12,409 --> 02:30:13,357
Manav, I can't leave.

2628
02:30:13,382 --> 02:30:15,196
It's my parents' anniversary.

2629
02:30:17,379 --> 02:30:18,150
Ayesha...

2630
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:22,255
Don't make me force you, alright?

2631
02:30:22,454 --> 02:30:23,296
Let's go.

2632
02:30:23,567 --> 02:30:24,444
<i>U“!</i>

2633
02:30:25,721 --> 02:30:26,799
Easy, tiger-

2634
02:30:27,369 --> 02:30:28,032
Shut up!

2635
02:30:29,315 --> 02:30:31,507
This is between me and my wife.

2636
02:30:33,555 --> 02:30:34,468
Get up!

2637
02:30:35,154 --> 02:30:36,304
Manav you are making a scene.

2638
02:30:36,371 --> 02:30:37,319
Get up!

2639
02:30:37,691 --> 02:30:38,805
Manav... Stop it!

2640
02:30:39,603 --> 02:30:41,796
Get up!

2641
02:30:43,774 --> 02:30:44,817
Papa!

2642
02:30:50,134 --> 02:30:52,505
What do you think you're doing?

2643
02:30:57,085 --> 02:30:59,598
If you even raise a
finger at my daughter...

2644
02:31:00,596 --> 02:31:03,203
I'll rip your arm out
and throw it into the sea.

2645
02:31:03,272 --> 02:31:04,812
Do you understand?

2646
02:31:23,015 --> 02:31:25,622
Please take your son
and leave as soon as possible.

2647
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:29,694
Please go.

2648
02:31:30,765 --> 02:31:33,443
You are making a mistake, Kamal ji.

2649
02:31:34,657 --> 02:31:36,885
I made a mistake many years ago.

2650
02:31:57,458 --> 02:31:58,371
Papa!

2651
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:01,039
Papa...

2652
02:32:05,661 --> 02:32:06,219
I am sorry.

2653
02:32:08,024 --> 02:32:09,386
I am really sorry.

2654
02:32:49,385 --> 02:32:50,642
Isn't this Farah's room?

2655
02:32:51,227 --> 02:32:52,626
She left.

2656
02:32:53,695 --> 02:32:54,916
She got fired.

2657
02:32:56,163 --> 02:32:57,383
She got off an hour ago.

2658
02:33:27,061 --> 02:33:27,974
I need to get off.

2659
02:33:28,035 --> 02:33:29,600
Sir, the ship is sailing...
lam sorry!

2660
02:33:32,171 --> 02:33:32,870
Hello, ma'm!

2661
02:33:32,935 --> 02:33:33,813
I need to get off the ship.

2662
02:33:33,874 --> 02:33:34,396
I am sorry, sir.

2663
02:33:34,465 --> 02:33:35,022
You can't get off.

2664
02:33:35,299 --> 02:33:36,033
I don't need to come back.

2665
02:33:36,307 --> 02:33:36,971
I just need to get off the ship.

2666
02:33:37,002 --> 02:33:38,922
Ya, but the ship just pulled out-

2667
02:33:38,983 --> 02:33:40,133
<i>No, no, m' am, you don't understand.</i>

2668
02:33:40,165 --> 02:33:41,835
It's an emergency,
I need to get off the ship.

2669
02:33:41,903 --> 02:33:42,674
Please stop the ship & let me off.

2670
02:33:42,738 --> 02:33:44,408
It is a security issue...

2671
02:33:44,961 --> 02:33:45,909
I'll give you a security issue,

2672
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:46,882
just let me off the ship!

2673
02:33:47,221 --> 02:33:48,063
What's the problem, Sir?

2674
02:33:48,124 --> 02:33:49,072
It's an emergency...

2675
02:33:49,132 --> 02:33:50,353
It's imperative I get
off the ship right now.

2676
02:33:50,419 --> 02:33:51,190
Please stop the ship.

2677
02:33:51,948 --> 02:33:52,470
Stop the ship!

2678
02:33:52,539 --> 02:33:53,202
Sir, calm down.

2679
02:33:53,269 --> 02:33:54,454
You don't tell me to calm down!

2680
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:56,331
Tell him!

2681
02:33:58,760 --> 02:33:59,531
What are you doing?

2682
02:33:59,594 --> 02:34:01,751
Farah has left and they
are not letting me off the ship.

2683
02:34:01,957 --> 02:34:03,000
So get off at the next port...

2684
02:34:03,070 --> 02:34:04,670
The next port is in Greece.

2685
02:34:04,739 --> 02:34:05,853
How will I find her, Sunny?

2686
02:34:06,684 --> 02:34:07,632
What do you mean loco?

2687
02:34:08,561 --> 02:34:10,790
Listen, calm down.

2688
02:34:11,169 --> 02:34:12,425
If there is an emergency on the ship,

2689
02:34:12,976 --> 02:34:14,197
they must be having a procedure.

2690
02:34:15,026 --> 02:34:17,089
They won't stop the
ship without a reason.

2691
02:34:18,016 --> 02:34:19,130
Okay?

2692
02:34:28,025 --> 02:34:29,590
I love you.

2693
02:34:32,892 --> 02:34:34,670
Ayesha is getting a divorce...

2694
02:34:53,572 --> 02:34:54,449
Get ready...

2695
02:34:55,657 --> 02:34:56,843
We have to do this right now.

2696
02:35:01,323 --> 02:35:02,094
Excuse me, everybody...

2697
02:35:02,156 --> 02:35:03,271
I need your attention, please.

2698
02:35:03,443 --> 02:35:06,026
Quiet everyone!

2699
02:35:06,293 --> 02:35:07,443
Kabir wants to make a toasts.

2700
02:35:09,247 --> 02:35:10,195
Thank you, Vinod Uncle.

2701
02:35:11,298 --> 02:35:13,846
Actually I am not
here to make a toast.

2702
02:35:14,634 --> 02:35:15,926
I am here to apologize.

2703
02:35:18,493 --> 02:35:19,405
Noorie...

2704
02:35:21,899 --> 02:35:23,049
You are one hell of a woman.

2705
02:35:25,166 --> 02:35:25,972
I love you

2706
02:35:26,034 --> 02:35:27,149
and you will always be my friend.

2707
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:29,341
But I can't marry you...

2708
02:35:29,406 --> 02:35:31,042
Because I am in love
with someone else...

2709
02:35:39,833 --> 02:35:40,948
lam sorry, Noorie...

2710
02:35:45,777 --> 02:35:46,962
Noorie!

2711
02:35:47,028 --> 02:35:47,799
Noorie...

2712
02:35:48,905 --> 02:35:50,020
You stay away from her.

2713
02:35:51,059 --> 02:35:52,209
Get her here...

2714
02:35:53,145 --> 02:35:54,057
Give her air!

2715
02:35:54,119 --> 02:35:55,031
Please get some water...

2716
02:36:01,314 --> 02:36:02,605
What the hell...

2717
02:36:02,669 --> 02:36:03,652
Is this?

2718
02:36:07,674 --> 02:36:08,136
Kamal...

2719
02:36:08,717 --> 02:36:10,257
Did you know about this?

2720
02:36:10,593 --> 02:36:12,655
He knows nothing about this,
Lalit uncle.

2721
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:14,114
I am really sorry, I-

2722
02:36:14,173 --> 02:36:15,050
You are sorry now?

2723
02:36:15,424 --> 02:36:16,230
You are sorry?

2724
02:36:16,294 --> 02:36:18,214
Sorry it had to happen this way.

2725
02:36:18,830 --> 02:36:20,229
Happen this way, happen that way...

2726
02:36:20,291 --> 02:36:23,597
Kabir, what you have
done is not correct.

2727
02:36:24,496 --> 02:36:26,689
You did this to a
sweet girl like Noorie...

2728
02:36:27,832 --> 02:36:28,982
It's bad!

2729
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:32,632
I am sorry, I had no choice.

2730
02:36:33,706 --> 02:36:36,871
I respect Noorie too much.

2731
02:36:36,939 --> 02:36:38,894
I can't lie to her...

2732
02:36:44,551 --> 02:36:47,550
The girl I am in love
with has lost her job,

2733
02:36:48,304 --> 02:36:49,382
asked to get off the ship...

2734
02:36:49,729 --> 02:36:50,642
Because of me.

2735
02:36:52,857 --> 02:36:53,935
I have to go and find her.

2736
02:36:58,940 --> 02:37:01,168
Papa, can I rely on you?

2737
02:37:03,250 --> 02:37:05,443
Papa, can I rely on you?

2738
02:37:07,942 --> 02:37:08,570
Yes...

2739
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:09,933
Good.

2740
02:37:11,001 --> 02:37:13,123
Because you are my lifeboat.

2741
02:37:13,781 --> 02:37:14,623
What?

2742
02:37:15,623 --> 02:37:16,879
Where are you going?

2743
02:37:24,104 --> 02:37:26,747
Kabir, that's not what I meant!

2744
02:37:29,874 --> 02:37:32,031
Noorie!

2745
02:37:55,733 --> 02:37:56,919
Sunny, where is he?

2746
02:37:56,984 --> 02:37:58,099
I don't know.

2747
02:37:59,973 --> 02:38:01,300
Man overboard! Starboard Side.

2748
02:38:05,048 --> 02:38:05,747
Kamal Uncle!

2749
02:38:05,778 --> 02:38:07,177
There... There he is!

2750
02:38:08,350 --> 02:38:08,943
Stop the ship.

2751
02:38:09,775 --> 02:38:10,996
Go, stop the ship!

2752
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:13,431
Okay.

2753
02:38:15,509 --> 02:38:16,730
Stop engines.

2754
02:38:17,039 --> 02:38:19,373
Oscar! Oscar!

2755
02:38:19,716 --> 02:38:23,022
Starboard side.

2756
02:38:27,119 --> 02:38:28,659
Someone stop this ship!

2757
02:38:28,718 --> 02:38:30,745
Where is this Oscar?

2758
02:38:30,768 --> 02:38:32,238
My child is drowning!

2759
02:38:32,297 --> 02:38:34,703
Oscar means they are
going to send a lifeboat.

2760
02:38:35,565 --> 02:38:36,892
They will save him, Kamal Uncle.

2761
02:38:36,954 --> 02:38:37,937
Lifeboat...

2762
02:38:38,519 --> 02:38:39,846
He said I am his life boat...

2763
02:38:39,909 --> 02:38:40,680
What?

2764
02:38:41,855 --> 02:38:43,111
I'm his lifeboat.

2765
02:38:43,176 --> 02:38:44,776
I have to go!

2766
02:38:44,845 --> 02:38:45,887
The lifeboat is up there.

2767
02:38:46,130 --> 02:38:46,901
There...

2768
02:38:46,965 --> 02:38:47,877
Get it down...

2769
02:38:47,938 --> 02:38:48,921
Do something please, Kamal!

2770
02:38:49,954 --> 02:38:51,246
Just get the lifeboat down!!

2771
02:38:51,309 --> 02:38:53,395
Don't worry, they're coming!

2772
02:38:53,465 --> 02:38:54,579
They will arrest him...

2773
02:38:54,646 --> 02:38:55,902
They will arrest him!

2774
02:38:56,940 --> 02:38:57,958
Just do as I say!

2775
02:38:58,226 --> 02:38:59,447
How do we get this down?

2776
02:38:59,511 --> 02:39:00,874
How?

2777
02:39:00,936 --> 02:39:02,999
Figure it out!

2778
02:39:03,544 --> 02:39:05,014
Pull the rope!

2779
02:39:06,150 --> 02:39:07,715
Lalit, be careful!

2780
02:39:11,121 --> 02:39:12,899
There must be a lever somewhere...

2781
02:39:12,962 --> 02:39:14,148
Nothing's happening!

2782
02:39:14,215 --> 02:39:15,021
Check up there.

2783
02:39:23,251 --> 02:39:24,994
Kamal Uncle!

2784
02:39:25,857 --> 02:39:26,770
There!

2785
02:39:26,831 --> 02:39:28,786
Lifeboat!

2786
02:39:31,627 --> 02:39:32,848
Hey!

2787
02:39:32,914 --> 02:39:33,826
Excuse me!

2788
02:39:38,266 --> 02:39:39,486
Stop!

2789
02:39:41,464 --> 02:39:42,720
Stop!

2790
02:39:44,244 --> 02:39:46,199
Officer, I need this boat!

2791
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:47,339
Sir, you can't enter!

2792
02:39:47,407 --> 02:39:48,628
It's his life, officer!

2793
02:39:48,693 --> 02:39:49,392
Back up!

2794
02:39:49,457 --> 02:39:50,572
I'll pay you as much as you want.

2795
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:51,410
Back up now.

2796
02:39:51,474 --> 02:39:52,517
They are not listening!

2797
02:40:05,446 --> 02:40:07,473
Sorry officer, nothing personals.

2798
02:40:07,531 --> 02:40:09,001
Just 5 minutes...

2799
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:10,495
Leave me!

2800
02:40:12,863 --> 02:40:14,154
Where are you going?

2801
02:40:14,218 --> 02:40:15,403
I have to take him to the port, Neelu.

2802
02:40:15,434 --> 02:40:17,070
If they catch him, they'll arrest him.

2803
02:40:17,138 --> 02:40:17,836
I have to go!

2804
02:40:17,902 --> 02:40:18,601
Even I'm coming!

2805
02:40:18,875 --> 02:40:19,432
Not right now!

2806
02:40:19,501 --> 02:40:21,006
Then when?!

2807
02:40:21,065 --> 02:40:22,570
For God's sake... Come!

2808
02:40:24,506 --> 02:40:25,584
Bhai saab!

2809
02:40:25,827 --> 02:40:26,491
Should I also come?

2810
02:40:26,556 --> 02:40:27,777
No, no you stay here...

2811
02:40:27,843 --> 02:40:29,443
Look after the guests, okay?

2812
02:40:29,511 --> 02:40:30,661
I'll handle everything here.

2813
02:40:30,727 --> 02:40:31,983
You don't worry.

2814
02:40:38,096 --> 02:40:40,395
Noorie, where's mom?

2815
02:40:42,927 --> 02:40:43,626
Papa!

2816
02:40:44,178 --> 02:40:46,477
Step back!

2817
02:40:46,542 --> 02:40:48,604
Sorry, I've got to go!

2818
02:40:50,366 --> 02:40:52,393
Pluto, out!

2819
02:40:52,451 --> 02:40:53,707
Ayesha, he won't go!

2820
02:40:53,772 --> 02:40:54,471
Pluto down!

2821
02:40:54,536 --> 02:40:55,686
Are you okay?

2822
02:40:56,413 --> 02:40:57,041
Yes...

2823
02:40:57,108 --> 02:40:57,736
No...

2824
02:40:57,803 --> 02:40:59,546
I don't know...

2825
02:41:00,653 --> 02:41:01,317
Everybody hang on.

2826
02:41:12,505 --> 02:41:13,726
Sunny!

2827
02:41:15,495 --> 02:41:17,580
Will you wait for me?

2828
02:41:19,492 --> 02:41:20,642
Dammit Sunny, say something...

2829
02:41:20,708 --> 02:41:22,699
Will you wait for me?

2830
02:41:22,758 --> 02:41:24,749
Forever!

2831
02:41:45,942 --> 02:41:47,684
Papa, do you know how this works?

2832
02:41:47,749 --> 02:41:49,906
I used to drive a truck,
how hard can this be?

2833
02:41:49,973 --> 02:41:51,786
Kamal, please!

2834
02:42:11,488 --> 02:42:13,609
There he is, Papa!

2835
02:42:15,276 --> 02:42:17,753
Careful Kamal, don't kill my son!

2836
02:42:21,498 --> 02:42:22,576
Kabir!

2837
02:42:41,622 --> 02:42:42,878
Careful!

2838
02:42:42,943 --> 02:42:44,128
I got you...

2839
02:42:51,424 --> 02:42:52,467
Mom!

2840
02:42:52,535 --> 02:42:54,420
Are you crazy!

2841
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:08,289
Papa, the guards are coming!

2842
02:43:08,350 --> 02:43:10,305
They're coming! Go, go, go!

2843
02:43:10,957 --> 02:43:13,541
Hurry up, Kamal!

2844
02:43:13,599 --> 02:43:16,041
Come on! Go!

2845
02:43:18,291 --> 02:43:19,309
Why are you not starting?

2846
02:43:19,368 --> 02:43:20,410
What is the problem?

2847
02:43:20,480 --> 02:43:21,558
Mama, please relax!

2848
02:43:21,627 --> 02:43:22,777
You just shut up!

2849
02:43:25,416 --> 02:43:27,715
We need to go, Papa!

2850
02:43:27,988 --> 02:43:29,658
They're almost here.

2851
02:43:29,726 --> 02:43:31,610
Down boy.

2852
02:43:45,158 --> 02:43:47,600
Are they really going to arrest us?

2853
02:43:47,660 --> 02:43:48,703
Obviously, Neelu.

2854
02:43:48,842 --> 02:43:51,662
But after we drop
this fool to the port.

2855
02:44:10,844 --> 02:44:12,966
It wasn't just Kabir
who got saved today.

2856
02:44:13,346 --> 02:44:15,752
My whole family has been rescued.

2857
02:44:16,057 --> 02:44:18,120
I had never seen them this happy

2858
02:44:18,177 --> 02:44:21,934
and headed in the
same direction before.

2859
02:44:26,831 --> 02:44:30,067
They say a leopard
can't change his spots

2860
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:35,215
but man has the power to change.

2861
02:44:36,702 --> 02:44:38,930
Now look at my own family.

2862
02:44:39,031 --> 02:44:43,203
Today they've learnt that love,
alone, is not enough.

2863
02:44:43,550 --> 02:44:47,757
If you love someone,
you have to set them free.

2864
02:44:49,771 --> 02:44:53,599
Free to be, free to live differently.

2865
02:44:54,428 --> 02:44:56,656
Every heart beats to it's own rhythm.

2866
02:44:56,688 --> 02:44:59,757
Let every heart beat.

2867
02:45:00,789 --> 02:45:02,816
And it doesn't matter that for miles

2868
02:45:02,874 --> 02:45:04,688
there is just water around us.

2869
02:45:04,751 --> 02:45:07,501
Or that our boat is really small.

2870
02:45:07,775 --> 02:45:10,702
We are together.

2871
02:45:10,903 --> 02:45:13,025
We are for each other.

2872
02:45:14,101 --> 02:45:16,400
What else does one want?

2873
02:46:07,835 --> 02:46:10,206
Every heart has its own rhythm

2874
02:46:10,268 --> 02:46:13,539
And an unheard melody

2875
02:46:13,605 --> 02:46:16,248
Every heart has its own beat

2876
02:46:16,316 --> 02:46:19,622
And a fire that unique

2877
02:46:20,034 --> 02:46:23,069
If emotions are melting away

2878
02:46:23,128 --> 02:46:26,055
Why shouldn't they be

2879
02:46:26,118 --> 02:46:29,152
If the imagination is running wild

2880
02:46:29,210 --> 02:46:31,889
Why shouldn't it be

2881
02:46:31,956 --> 02:46:35,642
Let every heart beat

2882
02:46:37,622 --> 02:46:40,965
Let every heart beat

2883
02:46:41,236 --> 02:46:43,571
Let it beat

2884
02:46:43,634 --> 02:46:47,083
What people say is not for you to heed

2885
02:46:47,145 --> 02:46:52,679
Just let your heart beat

2886
02:47:05,289 --> 02:47:10,574
If anyone has let even one moment slip

2887
02:47:11,093 --> 02:47:16,212
Held a glass but not
touched it to your lip

2888
02:47:16,863 --> 02:47:19,897
They don't know what life is

2889
02:47:19,956 --> 02:47:23,085
They don't know what bliss is

2890
02:47:23,153 --> 02:47:28,688
And all we can say to them is

2891
02:47:28,749 --> 02:47:31,949
If you want to dream,
be crazy and scream

2892
02:47:32,225 --> 02:47:35,046
Let every heart beat

2893
02:47:35,075 --> 02:47:37,718
Let it beat

2894
02:47:37,786 --> 02:47:41,022
Let every heart beat

2895
02:47:41,087 --> 02:47:43,802
Let it beat

2896
02:47:43,869 --> 02:47:47,033
What the world says
is not for you to heed

2897
02:47:47,101 --> 02:47:52,458
Just let your heart beat

2898
02:47:52,523 --> 02:47:55,238
Life has many colours

2899
02:47:55,269 --> 02:47:58,647
Hear it, know it

2900
02:47:58,709 --> 02:48:01,186
Each has his own way

2901
02:48:01,455 --> 02:48:05,046
Know it, accept it

2902
02:48:05,105 --> 02:48:08,068
If one is lost

2903
02:48:08,129 --> 02:48:11,164
Let him find his way

2904
02:48:11,222 --> 02:48:14,184
If one is indifferent

2905
02:48:14,246 --> 02:48:17,067
Let him be that way

2906
02:48:22,692 --> 02:48:25,133
Every heart has its own rhythm

2907
02:48:25,403 --> 02:48:28,674
And an unheard melody

2908
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:31,146
Every heart has its own beat

2909
02:48:31,207 --> 02:48:35,035
And a fire that unique

2910
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:38,099
If emotions are melting away

2911
02:48:38,159 --> 02:48:41,086
Why shouldn't they be

2912
02:48:41,148 --> 02:48:44,182
If the imagination is running wild

2913
02:48:44,206 --> 02:48:46,754
Why shouldn't it be

2914
02:48:46,814 --> 02:48:50,784
Let every heart beat

2915
02:48:52,688 --> 02:48:56,030
Let every heart beat

2916
02:48:56,094 --> 02:48:58,808
Let it beat

2917
02:48:58,874 --> 02:49:02,039
Forget the world, be free

2918
02:49:02,106 --> 02:49:05,626
Just let every heart beat

2919
02:49:07,668 --> 02:49:10,903
Let every heart beat

2920
02:49:10,934 --> 02:49:13,649
Let it beat

2921
02:49:13,716 --> 02:49:16,845
If you want to dream,
be crazy and scream

2922
02:49:16,912 --> 02:49:20,042
What the world says
is not for you to heed

2923
02:49:20,110 --> 02:49:23,073
What people say
is not for you to heed

2924
02:49:23,134 --> 02:49:28,977
Let every heart beat
