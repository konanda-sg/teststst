00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,535
So do not decide for ten minutes
How about --

31
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:46,426

Do not get the manager and the state officer, did you understand?

75
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,933
Yes daddy

How can you be half an hour
About the whole life decided?

98
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:05,021
In my opinion, it is not wise

99
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,269
Daddy said that a government employee?

00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:12,172

No, no, I do not mind bribing and taking

00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:04,314
Massage your nap at night
I do not expect that at all

117
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:08,887
I just want a woman
That's the whole life of my friend

118
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:17,353
Just be careful about my parents
And respect them; that's enough

119
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:21,145

00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:34,819
Your education should not be erased
It's good to work

123
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:38,250
Otherwise, I'm pushing
And you have to take a bribe

124
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,882
I have another waiting, but it's a bit tricky

125
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,371

And I call them
That agrees to my wedding

142
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:55,540
Something to say?
Of course, if you do not get upset

143
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,236
Say, I've never heard of you
I'm not upset

144
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,382
Okord is not Akord

145
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:06,530

Tomorrow is a few people from the Shukla family

180
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:05,074
OK

181
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:10,786
Shanti
Han--

182
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,003
I talked to Sato

183
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,410
We decided
Do not let the bride's family go

184
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:23,146
How to make a wedding?

185
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:24,954
What does that mean?

186
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:28,872
That means you can find a boyfriend
Do not you go

187
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:31,272
No more, han?

188
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,736
So how can it be without a jar
Did you make a wedding

189
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:37,344
Of your rights that did not gather anything
To find an officer's husband for a pony

190
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:40,918
This is the custom we did not make

191
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:44,385
Sato Wedding Whatever
Let's do it a little

192
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:46,950
Ponem wedding, which is two years away

193
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,175
Well, I'm going to double for another two years

194
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:54,018
Well, let it go
You ate the Shirton, it was cold

195
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:58,149
I told Mahish at 2:30

196
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,279
You do not say anything
One must have an account

197
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,108
Eat lactose and sleep

198
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,030
You and Abdai said one and two hundred
I say family and son are very good

199
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,639
If you want one and a half
We should not miss it

200
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:23,078
No, we can have 1200 of us
And that's why

201
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:24,727
You do not talk there

202
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,087
Two and a half million

203
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:33,847
No digits! Less than that

204
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:42,356
I'm going to be the groom?
Let's go

205
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,716
Wait to talk
Have we come

206
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,910
We have a small land

207
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:52,443
It's about 300--400 thousand sold

208
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:58,107
I saved a piece of art called Arti Bank
I take the rest of my loan from the bank

209
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,868
We want to merge with you

210
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,405
Why am i ashamed

211
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:09,137
How can you do that
.. This is an old drawing or otherwise

212
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:14,396
.. the moment of your spouse! I am
I'm talking

213
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:21,818
See my nephew is the only son of the family
And the only heir to this house

214
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,541
And now the state employee
You are tax office

215
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:31,317
And his groom is thirty years old
From college

216
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,425
what are you talking about?
So worth it to be something to say --

217
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:34,521
Yeah

218
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,400
.. I said that
.. We are joining ourselves. Otherwise

219
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:40,120
Sorry sir

220
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:45,642
No matter how my groom counted
If we make twice as many, then two million and a half do not

221
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,995
Mathieu is weak?

222
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:51,338
Han

223
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,080
Four million suggestions
Four million

224
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,905
Sato We love your daughter

225
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,982
Other than four million
We did not have a rupee

226
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:03,830
it's true

227
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,806
You said we were waiting for you

228
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,902
We waited for the next one to wait tonight

229
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,999
Where is your number boat?
Where is my phone?

230
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,486
Come on, groom, tonight next group
Four million

231
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:16,360
Let's go now

232
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:17,783
Do not talk too much

233
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:28,592
You have seen your literary and worldly readings
You know how powerful I am

234
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,314
I am responsible for urban development

235
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:37,715
But there is still a rupee for my bribe
You tell me how many your last album?

236
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:39,486
Not shockwave
.. I do not even have to

237
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:41,514
My son is telling you

238
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:44,828
Less than two and a half
This union is not possible;

239
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,568
Did you understand

240
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:49,740
One and eight hundred criticisms
Seventy sex

241
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,718
And this is our ultimate decision

242
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:57,079
My son and my sister also say that
We will not be less than this wedding

243
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,890
Let's go now
son in law

244
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:17,753
I agree with you
Your request will be executed

245
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,466
Why do you care?
Shanthi sweets

246
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,994
Now we're a family
Congratulations

247
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,362
You're just lying in front of me

248
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,266
'Your request is done'

249
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,673
Now 1300 Where do you add?

250
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:38,930
Rebellion does not make it any more
nowhere

251
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:43,460
I take a loan before retirement
And I'll give it away

252
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:50,765
At least my girlfriend with her loving husband
Marries

253
00:16:51,766 --> 00:17:05,766
:Intagram and the official telegram of our media
@BollyCineOfficial

254
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,278
Something to say?

255
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:24,174
Like a ponytail
Do you go chowla

256
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,191
You have any color like Shahrukh Khani

257
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,343
Really?
Shahrokh mihra

258
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:35,854
Let's go

259
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,144
Let's go

260
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:59,034
You're in the streets of Varanasi '
'So I wander all night in the middle of it

261
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:10,331
You're in the streets of Varanasi '
'So I wander all night in the middle of it

262
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:16,158
Characters like '
'And your eyes are like the Ganges

263
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:23,394
I'm off to sleep '
'And wake you up early in the morning

264
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:28,582
You're in the streets of Varanasi '
'So I wander all night in the middle of it

265
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,598
You're in the streets of Varanasi '
'So I wander all night in the middle of it

266
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:11,469
'Every Sunday, you see the cinema of the night with the film'

267
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:20,864
'It's a day to be your hero like movies.'

268
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:28,342
'Every Sunday, you see the cinema of the night with the film'

269
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:34,230
'It's a day to be your hero like movies.'

270
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:39,942
'Have fun, dance and be romantic with you'

271
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,326
'I'm glad to put you in your heart'

272
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,682
'That when I laugh at you,'

273
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,814
You're in the streets of Varanasi '
'So I wander all night in the middle of it

274
00:19:53,261 --> 00:20:01,061
You're in the streets of Varanasi '
'So I wander all night in the middle of it

275
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:06,982
Something to say?

276
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:11,106
I've never lived as much now as I am
I'm not happy with you marrying you

277
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:14,420
me too

278
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:22,953
Can I eat coffee?

279
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,594
So where's the honeymoon?

280
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,210
Han

281
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:48,299
honey moon

282
00:20:54,601 --> 00:21:01,673
I want to go to a cool place like a trash

283
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:03,418
We have to get involved

284
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:05,346
Okay, let's go

285
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,867
I also have a dream come true

286
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,508
What?

287
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:14,659
I once call with my husband

288
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,444
Come on

289
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,363
Eat wine and get drunk and cook

290
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:27,147
I never read, but you saw the movie
It seems to be very much

291
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,468
I saw that the hero gave the wine girl

292
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:34,739
And the whole thing is happening now
I want to do exactly that

293
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:44,747
And then if the husband is your best friend

294
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,389
Can you trust her no longer?

295
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:52,433
So what?
A moment

296
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,374
Pick one finger; this?

297
00:21:58,212 --> 00:21:59,089
Biscay is eating

298
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,364
Biscay is eating

299
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,116
What is Biscay?
Viski is right

300
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:09,307
Yeah, we'll get the same
I feel like I'm not coming from now

301
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:11,692
What was the second finger?

302
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:14,629
Brandy

303
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,075
Brandy is not your brand

304
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,630
I will be completely foreign to you

305
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:25,420
You are coming home soon
English, fix it all

306
00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:27,620
I'm tired of remembering them

307
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,324
What?

308
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,389
Really I said you brandy

309
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:33,028
Yeah satyndar

310
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:37,639
See you call me Sato

311
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,464
Those who love me
I call Sato

312
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:49,285
Come visit my beloved niece

313
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:50,644
Daie john
Where is the groom? --

314
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,321
O Baba! She's so busy
That's the wedding day

315
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,019
Now i am

00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:58,819
Everything, everyday
Tell me I do not refuse

317
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,123
You will not find this anywhere else in the market

318
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,100
The boot has its own

319
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:09,135
Yeah, it's very nice to go to the body
Do not worry about it anymore

320
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:13,689
Other than the face, there is also a color
See this

321
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:16,605
No sister, if you give this shorts
And the boot is taking shape

322
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,125
Nilam?
No, no color is different --

323
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:20,761
sister?
what are you talking about?

324
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,633
There is more art
I'm going to take a little

325
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:28,941
An arte dumb stones
Which changes the size of the shoe

326
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,789
My wedding should be a pedicure

327
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:40,942
What's going on?
See, this is my bed

328
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,723
Mommy; my brother is shaking me

329
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:45,529
Mommy Take It

330
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:49,419
Aunt; I tell God
You wanna see your own modo

331
00:23:49,936 --> 00:23:51,351
If Baba seeks us

332
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,473
You kill

333
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:53,795
I do not smoke

334
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:56,953
Lost son

335
00:23:58,705 --> 00:23:59,767
Rounded round

336
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,643
Stope is not inside me
Daddy

337
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:04,497
Very delicious

338
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,348
Which one?
This is a very nice little thing --

339
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:08,835
Arty loves it too

340
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:12,619
The red is the girl's daughter
Our son does not wear red

341
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:40,174
Very good

342
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:42,374
Your husband is in the office
My husband is an engineer

343
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:45,303
Mine lysing master
And licking yours

344
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:46,703
Are you bored?

345
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:47,650
I'm talking to dad

346
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:49,132
Your husband knows
Do you smoke so much

347
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:52,075
I do not hide anything from it
And not from me

348
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,351
You do not hide anything from your husband

349
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:55,339
I do not hide

350
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,634
I just said to Sato

351
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,223
I want to drink wine with him to be drunk

352
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,749
Aha? You are ahead of me
Now what did Sato Khan say?

353
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:07,296
He is more excited than me
She has not yet been drinking wine

354
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:10,485
The boat .. Sato is so funny

355
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:13,780
I then learned a couple of two weddings
Which is the most important thing

356
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:17,479
What?
A lot of sex and a lot of money --

357
00:25:17,962 --> 00:25:18,714
What are your sisters?

358
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:19,657
I say right again

359
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:25,124
! Wonderful timing!

360
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:30,209
It's as if without talking to you
Even her belly does not work

361
00:25:30,673 --> 00:25:31,843
Oh Sister

362
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,435
Let me see what the speaker says

363
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:34,970
Do you speak speaker Is it crazy?

364
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,133
Daddy I know what he says
Put on speaker

365
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,377
You do not say anything

366
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,342
I'm not saying daddy

367
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:43,457
Hello

368
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:44,486
happy Birthday

369
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,262
Did you remember

370
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,439
Yes, all you say is

371
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,562
eh?

372
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,358
Well see you want to see

373
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,070
You got the temple there, and there's a room behind it

374
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,772
There we can see each other easily

375
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:01,968
I told you

376
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,413
Why are you in the room?

377
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:07,480
Do not think about the thought room

378
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,600
That wedding will be in your room

379
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:16,094
I did not see you for several days
I want to see you

380
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,662
Without you, breathing is hard

381
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,538
I'm coming
Okay, tomorrow morning

382
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,881
Hey Sato .. Elo

383
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:35,000
I love her, aunt of the romantic boy
Go along, you're cool

384
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:37,557
Well, your life is a guarantee of two

385
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:42,006
The life of marriage is great
This boy is constantly drowning

386
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:42,966
sister

387
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:44,843
And I'm thinking about it

388
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,746
But Arty is not something interesting

389
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:49,835
What

390
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,082
I am thinking of financially

391
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,082
Why?

392
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:57,251
Think about who she is
Invites the temple?

393
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,388
So much a five star hotel

394
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,339
There, he took a room and gazed at you

395
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,983
Do you want to call the temple to sound bells?

396
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:10,131
I do not know her but I have four before
The poor can not breathe without me

397
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,096
I'll give it oxygen
And I'll charge it until the wedding

398
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,401
But you remember something
Do not let it hit you

399
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,353
The boys are very bored
(Wat D?)

400
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:21,349
She is acting
And he doubts himself

401
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:22,402
I'm telling you

402
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:23,539
Mother's eye

403
00:27:50,958 --> 00:28:01,497
happy Birthday

404
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:09,226
Morsi Sato Did you do all this for me !?

405
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:13,580
That is not something
Did you write something for me?

406
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:14,609
Poetry?

407
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:15,508
Yeah read

408
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:20,267
Joey, Maduroi, Diva Baharti
All of this is ZTEBOTI ARTI

409
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,042
Do you laugh

410
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,275
I do not smell very nice

411
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:29,882
My goal is you
The most beautiful Goddess initiative

412
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:34,112
Now I just want you
I love more than myself

413
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,652
Sato

414
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,594
Very nice and very lovely

415
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:43,785
Thankful

416
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:48,129
This shape is very much up to you

417
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:50,744
What do you think
Why wear my face?

418
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:52,937
Were you wearing me?

419
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,118
Pn

420
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,866

422
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:09,842

427
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:35,661
I do not say
I'll give you a wedding

428
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:42,612
Ok, I'm asking for something?

429
00:29:43,503 --> 00:29:44,078

430
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:45,978

00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:52,843
Can i get your lips?
Lips! Can i kiss

432
00:29:58,786 --> 00:29:59,878
Do you want a lipstick in the temple?

433
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,443
God is everywhere

434
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:05,410
eh? I would like to visit some place if I invited you
Maybe you did

435
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:08,643
A moment

436
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:17,666
I brought you something
happy Birthday

437
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:21,660
You're bribing me
To get my lip out?

438
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:23,551
I love you so much

439
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,866
Get it

440
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:26,871
Not a problem

441
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,222
Why do not you want now?

442
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,229
I do not want you

443
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:32,621
So get it over

444
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:34,316
Get it

445
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:37,597
Let it land

446
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:39,157
I keep it

447
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,607
Just take one

448
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,436
You get your Sato Lip
Then you doubt me

449
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:54,519
No I do not doubt

450
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:56,031
You are

451
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:57,546
Not to my mother's life

452
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,729
Now leave it for the wedding

453
00:30:59,046 --> 00:30:59,733
I do not doubt

454
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,282
Just one day Sato, goodbye

455
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,217
I do not doubt

456
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,457
Sato just waiting a bit

457
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,633

'My friend lives in every breath'

464
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:12,642
'You are rising like dawn and dawn'

465
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:20,289
'I'm walking along with you; I am with you';

466
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:26,581
'I want to love you more than myself.'

467
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:34,090
'And I have vowed with my heart that I am with you; I am with you'

'When I sleep all night watching'

470
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:02,325
'You are somehow dissolved in my existence'

471
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:07,489
'It's the same without you in the middle of a bush.'

472
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,403
'I wish you the mirror'

473
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,905
'Okay, I'll see you inside.'

474
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,186

'Love kites fly inside the chest'

478
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,120
'As if I was flying your scarf'

479
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:59,499
'I'm wet with you in the rain'

480
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:04,532
'When my hair is spread, I'll be your cloud.'

481

'My dark sea eyes are my dream sea'

482
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:14,971

'I accompany me, I accompany me, I accompany me'

485
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:40,772
Dadash Shah Dummad
Shovel .. shovel

486
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,438
Did not you wait for two more minutes?

487
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,671
From tomorrow, he will be angry
See what do you do

488
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:45,573
Go again

489
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:47,323

00:35:02,744 --> 00:35:04,685
The other word is written in my life

492
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:06,864
Well, this is the life that I got for you

493
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,086
Why are you just in this life?
I love you every single life

I love you very much so much

499
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,433
Heldy (drawing sandals) started?

00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,583
Yea, you were trained

501
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,000
Did you beat

502
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:00,854
I got too yellow

503
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:04,104
Dadash, this sister of arts

00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,914
Welcome to our family

505
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,559
No, it is not necessary

506
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,572
You're coming

507
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:21,956
Sister .. Mommy Interior

508
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:23,890
Let's go back

509
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:27,562
Is not your husband my daughter?

510
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:30,705
You know your aunt
Engineers are busy

511
00:36:30,962 --> 00:36:32,096
But it's a wedding day

512
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:33,674
Take my breakfast for breakfast

513
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,953
what are you doing?

514
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:38,168
My aunt I'm eating for the exam

515
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:41,094
that's good
I've done two times this time som--

516
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,730
Do not worry; you succeed
You just have to try a little bit

517
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,938
I just need your prayer

518
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:48,215
Thankful
Come on!

519
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:50,120
My baby is my baby

520
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:53,633
Last year we had gone
It is very high

521
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,754
Its a government, more
Its celebrations are high

522
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:56,755
Yes, exactly

523
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,570
Now Sato also has a government job

524
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:05,098
Ok not aunt Sato Worker
And Arty wants the wedding party to work

525
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:10,142
Good luck that allowed you
My husband's family who did not allow

526
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,146
Let's go
Who said?

527
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:20,382
Aunt .. Sato had told the arts

528
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,321
Sato is a kid
He says with excitement

529
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:26,193
Cover it too
I still choose

530
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:28,937
See my daughter
My soul

531
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:30,897
The brides of the Mishra family are not working

532
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,135
It's our custom, what do people say?
Who lives with the bride's money?

533
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:41,066
You are our brides in our house
They never work and do not

534
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:44,058
At least I'm not alive

535
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:48,391
And about government work
I am the president of this room

536
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,523
Take care of your bloodthirsty art
So think of a government job, han?

537
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:52,924
Mommy

538
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,386
My daughter is this money

539
00:37:57,123 --> 00:37:58,630
Take my son some more!
! You did not eat anything

540
00:38:12,015 --> 00:38:13,768
You are very attractive

541
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,070
Sato mummy behind the lane

542
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:18,978
Elo

543
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,525
I am very stressed
My stomach is a jerah

544
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:24,116
what happened?
I'm not talking about this

545
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,090
Send me a picture of the bridal dress

546
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,618
Some things must be ambiguous

547
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,434
I want to see you again

548
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:33,731
Surely you see
Today I was very handsome

549
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,150
Why wait anymore now?
Now we almost married

550
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,605
Stop him

551
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:39,872
I'm going to follow you

552
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:41,120
Bye

553
00:38:41,744 --> 00:38:45,477
Do you beat me? Are you okay?
More money

554
00:38:46,196 --> 00:38:47,522
I just had a phone call

555
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:49,924
You could not give me a try
Did you give pc

556
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,364
Is this a sister too?

557
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:54,055
Not telling me; are you crazy?

558
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:56,351
Your tone is over
Now tell me?

559
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:00,320
You accepted the arts
You can be an officer

560
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:06,560
The results are now
I saw online

561
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:11,950
Am I an officer?
My sister was accepted?

562
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,231
We have to celebrate

563
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:20,806
..I

564
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:26,289
All ten years of exam
I and two years old engineers are dismissed

565
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:29,065
And this is the first time this four times

566
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,574
I scored four nine points

567
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:33,940
What are you six, ladies?
Perfect Smith

568
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,047
Artish your mind
You own your own home

569
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:43,286
Red light car
And the knights say:'Yes, sir.'

570
00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:46,977
Your book is so bad and so much
Respect that you can not tolerate

571
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:50,129
Now, yes, you say hello
Officer

572
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:54,776
Officer Shukla not ass
I'm artistic officer of Satynder Mishra

573
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,961
I do not believe it
My sister will be the officer

574
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:01,760
Sato is so good for me

575
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:06,671
Wedding is the happiest day of life
And for my dubbing celebration

576
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:09,894
Sister .. Yeah

577
00:40:39,302 --> 00:40:41,854

Listen to daddy
Please do not get angry

586
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:58,429
What is that

587
00:40:58,684 --> 00:40:59,360
Tell me too soon

588
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:03,009
Artistic Examination Police

00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:24,805
Daddy did not listen to you
He can be an officer

595
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,839
From today, Artis is the bride of the family of Mishra

596
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:33,106
What does he do and what?
Mishra makes a decision

597
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:36,921
OK? Are you ready for the presenter?

598
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:41,266
Mommy make him look
We are making a big mistake

599
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:42,295
Barat Torah

600
00:41:42,493 --> 00:41:44,151
He does not want to do an artistic work

601
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:46,718
We made a big mistake
By choosing this family

602
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,379
I say to Bob, nothing has happened

603
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:50,081
Your mom listen

604
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,538
Manjou will say nothing

605
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:56,412
Arroyo today is impossible to work
I can not be

606
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:57,965
.. I know you're angry, but once

607
00:41:58,154 --> 00:42:03,478
Do not talk nonsense, otherwise my hand will rise

608
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:05,822
What do you do
This is our guest

609
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:10,049
Some other word

610
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:13,128
I say daddy ... why do not I say

611
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:14,120
Shut up

612
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,224
What do you want

613
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:17,986
Artis like me and my mom to cook
And great baby?

614
00:42:18,547 --> 00:42:20,180
Do not try to be an officer once?

615
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:21,712
First time accepted

616
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,074
So talented
You're destroying your life

617
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:25,989
Why do not I say

618
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:30,233
Miss you and that mother
Girls are hiding in the houses

619
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:32,664
That's what you want for this nonsense
Stop this wedding?

620
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,188
Tell Mishra my daughter can be an officer

621
00:42:35,383 --> 00:42:36,935
Console Wedding; Will I say this?

622
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:39,385
Yes, you cancel your wedding

623
00:42:39,983 --> 00:42:43,670
She can marry later
But he can not be an officer

624
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:45,232
Her mother does not want to work

625
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:49,647
He always wanted to work
Bring this wedding

626
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:52,514
Manjoo is the crazy girl

627
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:56,355
Put it in front of my eyes
Otherwise I'll kill you

628
00:42:56,891 --> 00:42:58,051
I'll be righteous then

629
00:42:58,234 --> 00:43:01,396
The cruelty that you are having with the art of life

630
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,220
Shut up

631
00:43:04,763 --> 00:43:06,289
I'm oppressing the arts?

632
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:11,525
See you married
Let your sister marry

633
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:13,510
Do not try to ruin it

634
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,029
Mom tell her

635
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:15,839
Silent

636
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:20,866
enough. Take the vehicle and go

637
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,536
Without you, we will hold an artistic wedding
Go

638
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:25,000
..Just once

639
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:25,969
Go from here

640
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:28,624
from your hand
My daughter is Vesta

641
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:42,625
:Intagram and the official telegram of our media
@BollyCineOfficial

642
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:14,029
What is your sister
come here--

643
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,029
I now sent a message to Sato
every thing is fine?

644
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:16,619
what happened?

645
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:18,069
Listen carefully, see what I say

646
00:44:18,643 --> 00:44:20,203
Today we were going to the groom's house

647
00:44:20,685 --> 00:44:22,493
I told your mother that she wanted an art worker

648
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:25,931
He completely rejected and said
Mishra's family bride does not work

649
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:28,937
How did you say that?
Sato told me

650
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:32,159
Yeah, I said you talk to Sato
Do you know what did you answer

651
00:44:32,591 --> 00:44:35,951
Sato is baby and still covered
I buy it for you, do you mean this?

652
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,863
I was not the addressee, you were

653
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:43,387
I'm sure you're at home
Do not want to work

654
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:44,887
Forget about being an officer

655
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:47,475
Sato told me

656
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:49,225
What is Baba saying to Sato?

657
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:53,997
She can not speak in front of her mother
Now you decide what you are doing

658
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,651
My sister can not be a housewife

659
00:44:58,097 --> 00:45:01,988
I want to marry Sato
But I want to do it

660
00:45:02,471 --> 00:45:04,206
You told her the first appointment
He accepted

661
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,247
I can not have a house

662
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:10,382
.. I'm talking to Sato

663
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,817
Why do you like Satu Satu parrot?

664
00:45:13,017 --> 00:45:13,799
That's my future husband

665
00:45:13,966 --> 00:45:15,101
It's a secret

666
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:20,417
When the officer is 25
Like Sato, you work on your podium

667
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:26,683
I do not say that good son is very good
But even if he does not understand, he does not understand

668
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:36,363
What can i do

669
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:38,237
What can I do?

670
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:41,093
.. see me, father and mother .. it's yours

671
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:43,609
Husband, kid and three meals
That nobody knows

672
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:49,517
And respect the other side
Think of arts

673
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:51,894
Your future is calling

674
00:45:52,456 --> 00:45:54,789
Check out the exam result Why did you come today?

675
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:56,775
Tomorrow I could come back

676
00:45:57,694 --> 00:46:01,727
You could not do anything
You can run today

677
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:04,967
.. I call to my husband

678
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:07,103
She solves it
You go with him

679
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,314
I can not do this with Sato

680
00:46:36,738 --> 00:46:37,836
Can you do it with you?

681
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,880
I and my city with you; you run away

682
00:46:42,278 --> 00:46:44,662
Someone does not hear me here
run

683
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:49,496
You're all happy with the Baba and Sato officer

684
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:51,941
Artistic

685
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:15,958
What do you want my daughter

686
00:47:24,748 --> 00:47:25,812
Daddy .. Sato

687
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,806
I solved it

688
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:30,558
Do you want to be an officer?

689
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,334
So run away

690
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,582
There is no other way

691
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:43,649
This community of this year
Keeping the boys on her head

692
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,562
But she does not value girls

693
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,620
And not a favorite life
They give them their own

694
00:47:50,156 --> 00:47:52,435
That's when a girl gets the chance

695
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,660
Good luck, and life is happy
Make herself

696
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:59,177
All the seas of fire must be rejected and gone

697
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:03,004
Escape my daughter
run

698
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,618
Artist go to Barat

699
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,130
I have to go down so that no one understands or rises

700
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,222
I can not kill my dad

701
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:31,532
Artistic Dance Meditation

702
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:35,582
Just keep in mind that the guy says you're talking
You heard and ran away, go

703
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,048
Sister, what did Sato do?
I love you very much

704
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,870
Rejoin her love again

705
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:43,476
But this opportunity does not get any more
Go

706
00:48:43,977 --> 00:48:45,635
I talk to her once

707
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:50,495
Not artistic; I did not say so
Do not talk to him. Let's go

708
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:52,790
If I understand why
The creditor also counts

709
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:53,824
Come on go

710
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,926
Barat Dam Valley

711
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:12,424
Make a dish

712
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:13,966
Mommy

713
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,990
Go ahead of the car on the back

714
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:35,645
Go to succeed

715
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:12,142
congratulations

716
00:51:12,578 --> 00:51:13,667
Happy you too

717
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:32,342
Where is the arts?

718
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,639
Where is Arty?

719
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:41,655
She did not want to marry

720
00:51:42,856 --> 00:51:44,464
Did not he want to, or did you not?

721
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:46,048
What do you do

722
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:47,599
Hands up your big girl?

723
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,902
Go away
Go away

724
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:53,970
Do not you? Do I crawl
Worship him

725
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:58,578
Do not touch it;
Why do you give it

726
00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:00,049
Barat came

727
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:07,902
Say where have you gone
Where have you gone

728
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:15,286
I do not know Daddy, sorry

729
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:23,182
Send me a study

730
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,839
Send Allah Abad

731
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,794
Do not have a young girl's supply?

732
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:33,995
Why did you invite me?
Got rid of

733
00:52:37,105 --> 00:52:38,674
Aunt Husband, why do you bother me?
Do you empty your sister?

734
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:41,530
I'm going to be two years old
The arts accepted

735
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:45,799
If it is to me
I choke them up

736
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:49,469
I'm burning myself

737
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,919
Stop

738
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,916
Spit on my face
What do we do now

739
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:09,206
Come on here

740
00:53:12,662 --> 00:53:14,550
I understand your pain

741
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:19,110
Now is the hard time
But we must somehow break it out

742
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:22,518
See the people

743
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:27,358
Just think about it 1,800 million in cash
What did we get?

744
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:31,312
Tell me what to say

745
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:34,616
Excuse me
Our girl escaped

746
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:42,634
Put our money in your envelope
And deliver it, tell me this?

747
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:50,129
That's it! You do not understand Mahish if you listen
Our daughter escaped and did not give us a rupee

748
00:53:51,385 --> 00:53:53,706
All the income of your life goes up

749
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:02,914
So how are you returning money?

750
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:05,035
Sister does not come back
We must return

751
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:12,359
Husbands allow me to manage this

752
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:13,777
Just keep them silent

753
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:21,699
Tea we get

754
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:25,259
First, what is the flow?
Why did you ask us here?

755
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:33,943
I'm really kidding
A great catastrophe came to our head

756
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:37,137
And so on your head

757
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,516
Bella
Yes--

758
00:54:39,165 --> 00:54:40,523
What is the issue?

759
00:54:41,238 --> 00:54:44,062
.. the thing is that art

760
00:54:44,853 --> 00:54:45,965
what happened?

761
00:54:47,053 --> 00:54:50,005
My son was not in his room

762
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:51,877
What was there?

763
00:54:52,085 --> 00:54:53,556
Only this letter was there

764
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:55,678
See her

765
00:54:56,742 --> 00:54:57,585
See you

766
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:05,763
When your daughter understood that
You've got two and a half million warriors

767
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:09,931
It is not decided to marry you

768
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,018
He left the wedding and went

769
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:13,947
Where have you gone

770
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:15,633
Where are we going from where are our son?

771
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:16,723
Call me to talk to her

772
00:55:16,796 --> 00:55:18,680
Do not answer us
How do i say you talk

773
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:21,943
How about Jazz with satisfaction of both sides
Was determined

774
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:22,923
You were right

775
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,662
It is not a matter of joy; I know

776
00:55:25,848 --> 00:55:27,019
Forgive me Sato

777
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:32,563
I have not told you to give it a try
Today came the conclusion and I accepted

778
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:34,459
I'm an officer

779
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:36,611
Allahabad sent a lesson

780
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:39,167
Maybe that's where you've been loved

781
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:43,184
Homage to family
And ran away; did you understand?

782
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:47,359
You are baking charcoal
And blush your face

783
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:49,378
.. You have to stop the ZebNet, or else

784
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:50,330
What are you doing, for example?

785
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:57,803
I do not have a job with you
Dear Mishra, you are literate

786
00:55:58,404 --> 00:56:00,108
I will love you

787
00:56:00,562 --> 00:56:03,996
Our daughter does not want to be married again

788
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:08,629
For this, we have one and eight hundred criticisms
Relax with us

789
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:13,161
And come back with respect with Baratton

790
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,844
This is a console wedding

791
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:16,589
How is console

792
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,313
Your girl escaped
Do you want money from us?

793
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:22,769
Embarrassed, huh?
We did not see a rupee

794
00:56:33,943 --> 00:56:36,111
We will not return a rupee
Come on here

795
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,193
Are you crazy?

796
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:42,726
Do not think about it without giving money
Can you get it, did you understand?

797
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,051
Chando Kishawu
Come on, you

798
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,524
Put the gun on Mishra's head

799
00:56:53,457 --> 00:56:57,431
One hundred and eight hundred to the last rial
If you do not lose ourselves

800
00:56:58,643 --> 00:57:03,741
Someone does not leave here
Hey, take a sign

801
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:05,349
I'm going to daddy

802
00:57:05,661 --> 00:57:06,449
hit it

803
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:09,310
I'm afraid of you?
Come on

804
00:57:11,072 --> 00:57:12,856
Wash your cousin

805
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:15,993
And you do not read the bad guy with your own hands

806
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,017
Do not get out of here, did you understand?

807
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:20,590
A moment
what are you doing? --

808
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:24,363
Leave it
I'll get your money

809
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:28,220
But you do not have Dad and Daimim

810
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:33,157
I'm going
Go away

811
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:34,451
my son

812
00:57:54,626 --> 00:57:57,898
Artistic

813
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,610
Did not you see the arts

814
00:58:00,015 --> 00:58:00,810
No

815
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:06,402
Artistic

816
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,535
Where is the hi--art?

817
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:24,250
Whatever I call, I do not answer
where is it?

818
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:30,202
Take it with you

819
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:32,234
What is han sato

820
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:33,536
I'll tell you later

821
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:34,631
What have you done
Sato --

822
00:58:37,502 --> 00:58:40,158
<i> I'm sorry Sato
I would not have told you something </ i>

823
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,439
<i> I had an officer exam </ i>

824
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:44,029
<i> Today's results come true
I accepted </ i>

825
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:46,038
<i> I'm going to be an officer </ i>

826
00:59:27,532 --> 00:59:28,331
Sato

827
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:39,242
what happened?

828
00:59:44,817 --> 00:59:49,314
Bobb
it `s nothing--

829
00:59:49,472 --> 00:59:52,644
Do not cry

830
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:54,548
You do not cry
Save them

831
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,989
Where did you put Pula?
I want to bring them

832
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:04,796
Eight hundred spent a million
Take you and bring them with you

833
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:07,364
One million is not, everyone reads

834
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:08,788
We'll see them later

835
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:09,996
They do not accept

836
01:00:11,946 --> 01:00:14,359
Where is this night coming from?

837
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:27,000
:A specialized translation of our artistic cultural media
Interpreters:Bingxa and Hajir

838
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,106
I left it for my pony wedding

839
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:45,146
It was you wearing my wedding

840
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,331
Damn it

841
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,507
That girl brought us life
He turned into hell and went

842
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,116
Eloh sister

843
01:01:04,722 --> 01:01:07,546
Han! They're going now
Return all the money

844
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:09,582
Daddy good

845
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:12,283
Well, that's not; the uncle is sitting there

846
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:15,715
I'm one of my two days
To make things worse

847
01:01:16,683 --> 01:01:18,882
Did you call Sato?

848
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:23,730
Several times, but according to your wishes
I did not answer

849
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:27,556
Sister some time to call her?

850
01:01:28,395 --> 01:01:30,922
Yeah talk to him
Very sad

851
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:34,723
We just did the same mistake
His heart fail

852
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:37,369
I saw her

853
01:01:49,995 --> 01:01:51,635
Keep the car

854
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:57,954
Where is it going
.. see you here

855
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:00,362
Husband

856
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:06,515
Daddy daddy

857
01:02:07,883 --> 01:02:12,802
Do not die my son
I'm not so weak

858
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:18,170
I just felt a little nervous

859
01:02:18,658 --> 01:02:19,706
Open the button

860
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:21,139
A moment

861
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:34,154
I do not want to go home
We were going to go home with the bride

862
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:43,387
What is going to go home now?
See your mother's tears?

863
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,874
Everyone is watching

864
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,328
.. 'see there'

865
01:02:50,995 --> 01:03:00,465
... 'Professor Mishra, whose son's wedding'

866
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,952
Alright, my son went away

867
01:03:31,489 --> 01:03:38,396
What do you say

868
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:45,429
Sato Vector
Please take it

869
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,960
We do not let them go
Do not worry, do not worry

870
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,945
5 years later

871
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:23,556
See in support of amateurs and planners
We opened a special window

872
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:26,660
Which does not require a double effort

873
01:05:27,134 --> 01:05:30,100
So I hope you progress
And invest in our area

874
01:05:30,884 --> 01:05:32,885
That's for you too
And it will be useful to us

875
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,612
Ask me if you have any questions

876
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,028
Nilam tell you a few times
Come straight to you

877
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,861
And I've told you many times
Here you are Rice

878
01:05:52,724 --> 01:05:57,049
Look, I tried five times
I did not accept

879
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,030
But you were accepted the first time

880
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:03,694
I thank you for my art
I'm back

881
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,182
Today I'm busy with your blessing

882
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:08,647
Otherwise, I would teach you a school in Kanpur

883
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:10,679
Do you smoke, tea?
tea?--

884
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,986
Someone compliments us
Then you have to make it all

885
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,545
Two teas please

886
01:06:18,744 --> 01:06:22,368
Truth, what's that
I heard you in the office right?

887
01:06:22,776 --> 01:06:24,478
! Depends on what you heard

888
01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:25,846
Do not go that way

889
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,883
You're just talking about the office

890
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:29,232
What?

891
01:06:35,547 --> 01:06:37,198
What do you do
I did not look

892
01:06:37,882 --> 01:06:38,770
You did not look
You walked

893
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,042
If you add the road, you will get low
Weight added

894
01:06:42,314 --> 01:06:44,211
Sister's husband is always there

Sato

941
01:09:26,183 --> 01:09:28,258
Hello .. you swear
Calling up with a small name?

942
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:32,795

Four years

946
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,002
You started from that first
To bribe

947
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:52,870
Do you like bribes?

948
01:09:54,174 --> 01:09:57,215
Not right; you are a part of the system

949
01:09:57,655 --> 01:09:59,134
So there's no problem getting bribed

950
01:09:59,551 --> 01:10:00,783
it's true?

951
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,279
it's not like that
I said you are --

952
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:21,964
My Lord, I'm not guilty
I can explain

953
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:25,033
You do not need to explain something
Miss Arty Shukla

954
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:26,898
What you wanted to do

955
01:10:31,088 --> 01:10:32,688
Now I want everything

956
01:10:35,257 --> 01:10:38,633

958
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,960

Eve, brother of a four--year--old girl

964
01:11:13,654 --> 01:11:16,333
And now in the right time
You took the case from the minister

965
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,167
What do you think?
Guilty

966
01:11:20,718 --> 01:11:22,111
It does not matter to me

967
01:11:22,854 --> 01:11:24,903

For bribes;

986
01:12:14,378 --> 01:12:17,379
There was no ordinary bribe
30 million

987
01:12:17,732 --> 01:12:18,563
30 million

988
01:12:18,891 --> 01:12:20,364

Get Sato ... But do not worry

1008
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:38,689
Listen to Mahish
She did not escape because of Jazz

1009
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:42,311
She ran to be an officer

1010
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:46,837
And 25 secretaries like Sato
Work on his part

1011
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:50,745
You're in the form of secretaries like Sato
Spit does not matter

1012
01:13:51,746 --> 01:14:05,746
:Intagram and the official telegram of our media
@BollyCineOfficial

1013
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:21,359
That poison you filled your heart '
'You will see

1014
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:28,030
'My pain and fire, Oh, I'm gripping my stern'

1015
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:34,482
'Now you see the result of selfishness'

1016
01:14:35,074 --> 01:14:47,210
'You rejected my love now, you will see my revenge'

1017
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:04,058
'The answer to my love of selfishness'

1018
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:10,588
'You did not have to betray me again.'

1019
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:17,138
'You will see me hate me this morning and night'

1020
01:15:17,856 --> 01:15:23,768
'You rejected my love now, you will see my revenge'

1021
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:40,324
'All the atrocities you have done with my mind'

1022
01:15:40,968 --> 01:15:46,672
'At last, God gave you the wrongdoings'

1023
01:15:47,498 --> 01:15:53,160
'The whole world will see you defeat in public'

1024
01:15:54,005 --> 01:15:59,943
'You rejected my love now, you will see my revenge'

1025
01:16:02,872 --> 01:16:03,791
All the house is upset

1026
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:08,408
Now the officer wants to do anything
And wherever he wants to attack?

1027
01:16:10,397 --> 01:16:10,897
Guess what

1028
01:16:11,558 --> 01:16:12,120
Bring a glass

1029
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:14,259
He has taken his case

1030
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,748
It is not clear just come to take revenge from the arts?

1031
01:16:17,427 --> 01:16:20,091
Why do we fear when we have not done anything?

1032
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:22,628
Because our force would not be her
The power of the other hand

1033
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:26,777
She told her straight
He throws him in jail

1034
01:16:27,847 --> 01:16:28,959
You hurt you badly

1035
01:16:29,735 --> 01:16:31,991
Apparently work but personal revenge
He's gonna be

1036
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:35,913
What is your sister saying?

1037
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:46,873
Artistic
Why crying? --

1038
01:16:47,817 --> 01:16:48,761
All right

1039
01:16:49,145 --> 01:16:51,745
Drink water
All right

1040
01:16:57,987 --> 01:16:58,903
Do something

1041
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:01,218
Apologize for it

1042
01:17:01,749 --> 01:17:04,893
She loved you so much
Maybe for that very angry

1043
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:09,038
Maybe you'll get it
I heard that I did not get a woman yet

1044
01:17:10,237 --> 01:17:14,229
Look outside of her office
Or invite some coffee

1045
01:17:24,446 --> 01:17:27,660
Do you sit by, I'll call them
Come on!

1046
01:18:02,008 --> 01:18:02,772
How are you

1047
01:18:03,164 --> 01:18:04,373
How can i help you

1048
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:10,393
I see very sorry

1049
01:18:11,113 --> 01:18:12,009
for what?

1050
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,706
Because of what I did with you

1051
01:18:15,832 --> 01:18:17,168
I still regret

1052
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:21,874
Jazz was just an excuse
I had an exam

1053
01:18:22,217 --> 01:18:22,929
Do you drink tea?

1054
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:28,299
Ashok ... Ashok

1055
01:18:30,799 --> 01:18:31,328
Yes sir

1056
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:32,294
Take two tea

1057
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:36,181
So what did you say?

1058
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:45,250
I had given a test of the results of the day
A wedding came

1059
01:18:47,741 --> 01:18:52,605
I did not work
I also gave you a message

1060
01:18:53,945 --> 01:18:56,993
My sister said your family
I do not want to work

1061
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:00,359
.. I do not know if I'm wrong

1062
01:19:02,011 --> 01:19:03,963
What is han

1063
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:08,435
I know you've been cruel
Very hard

1064
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:11,579
I want from my bottom
I apologize for you

1065
01:19:14,685 --> 01:19:16,989
I know why so much
I'm angry with you

1066
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:19,794
But what should I do?

1067
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:23,933
If you're so sorry
Why did not you try to see me?

1068
01:19:25,843 --> 01:19:27,093
How many times did you call that night?

1069
01:19:29,235 --> 01:19:31,055
I thought we loved each other

1070
01:19:34,259 --> 01:19:37,763
And now that the case is in my hands
Do you understand your mistake?

1071
01:19:40,954 --> 01:19:42,226
... and if I did not come here

1072
01:19:42,595 --> 01:19:44,307
I never thought about you ... no?

1073
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:53,267
You were already pragmatic
You just became more beautiful now ... Han?

1074
01:19:55,934 --> 01:20:03,017
Arty Shukla officer
Very tempting and desirable

Do you feel uninteresting?

Ok so tell you
How do you talk to me?

See yourself! You're seducing me
And I'm sorry

01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:50,200
I'm ready to go ... do it

01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:51,416
Satinder

1086
01:20:53,179 --> 01:20:56,232
.. Shukla, if you think

1087
01:20:56,584 --> 01:20:59,128
Seeing the face of beauty
I forget the frustration of my family

1088
01:20:59,696 --> 01:21:00,463
It's never so

1089
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,540
And so you never forget

1090
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:07,365
Satynder Please do not personalize the story

1091
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:10,596
There is a person
It is very much

1092
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:15,068
The gentry you gave me
I never remember

1093
01:21:16,836 --> 01:21:18,011
This is the biggest fight of my life

1094
01:21:19,177 --> 01:21:23,554
And really ... I'm not angry
I hate you

1095
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:27,909
Now, get out of here

1096

Mrs. Shukla; again wearing a ponytail

1099
01:21:47,392 --> 01:21:48,712
I'm going to get you down

1100
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:00,016
Hello tea

1101
01:22:00,385 --> 01:22:01,083
Put it on the table

1102
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:04,729
Say han

1103
01:22:06,404 --> 01:22:10,108
Thank you for this archetype
And this is my own

1104
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:11,855
Is this your own?
Yes --

1105
01:22:12,976 --> 01:22:14,032
And that cockroach builder?

1106
01:22:14,456 --> 01:22:15,768
He has a lot of businesses

1107
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:17,944
With great politicians

1108
01:22:18,376 --> 01:22:20,433
And this is the land
To build the factory

1109
01:22:20,712 --> 01:22:22,552
And now you're on your own
And will come back soon

1110
01:22:23,276 --> 01:22:24,297
Has this deal been arranged?

1111
01:22:24,476 --> 01:22:27,655
Yes sir, I was a deal broker
My job is the same

1112
01:22:28,649 --> 01:22:29,792
The document was on the ground?

1113
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,888
Yes sir, no document
How can you sell it?

1114
01:22:33,653 --> 01:22:35,259
Where is the land owner?
America gone

1115
01:22:35,741 --> 01:22:37,764
And it's clear that you do not have a number

1116
01:22:38,123 --> 01:22:39,201
Not sir

1117
01:22:39,764 --> 01:22:40,748
Address?

1118
01:22:41,245 --> 01:22:42,475
Something else! Where should I be?

1119
01:22:43,065 --> 01:22:44,618
I want to ask at 9 o'clock
It's now five o'clock

1120
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,543
What did you eat

1121
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:47,663
First of all I can go outside
I'll eat later

1122
01:22:48,423 --> 01:22:49,455
Do not let me swing

1123
01:22:50,113 --> 01:22:51,210
Take care

Where is the photo?

1130
01:23:27,283 --> 01:23:32,850
We had gone to see the earth
Which was bought by Cokriya

1131
01:23:33,381 --> 01:23:35,781
You personally went and checked
Where is the earth and how much?

1132
01:23:36,419 --> 01:23:38,435
And then the hand of the state land
Did you call Kukriya?

1133
01:23:38,942 --> 01:23:41,255
No sir I did not really know

1134
01:23:44,993 --> 01:23:45,832
Who is this guy

1135
01:23:46,617 --> 01:23:48,457

This land that has just bought its value
About 150 million. How many buys?

1139
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:59,628
.. Actually, this was the flow

1140
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:00,773
60 million

1141
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:03,035
Yes

1142
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:07,755
The land reached you 150 million sixty million
Then you got sixty direct benefits

1143
01:24:08,165 --> 01:24:08,852
Sixty

1144
01:24:09,092 --> 01:24:10,269
Thirty to Dadi to another Shukla Art

My friend bought me and my birthday
Gave me a gift

1149
01:24:28,093 --> 01:24:29,710
I sent it, I did not accept it

1150
01:24:30,146 --> 01:24:33,222
Still parked in my car park
I did not use it at all

1151
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:35,335
Omsich

1152
01:24:35,776 --> 01:24:36,326
Yes sir

1153
01:24:36,645 --> 01:24:38,253
Have you ever brought a gift machine to you?

1154
01:24:38,433 --> 01:24:39,169
Never sacrifice

1155
01:24:39,338 --> 01:24:40,014
Never?

Of course when you're in the system
Hard to dismiss, no?

1160
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,620
Do you have any comments?

1161
01:24:58,779 --> 01:25:01,020
Your Excellency Cockerie Artisan
That's great

1162
01:25:01,815 --> 01:25:03,772
Do not ask for a land document
Is not that impossible?

1163
01:25:04,424 --> 01:25:08,068
This should be seen by your officers
That land government

1164
01:25:08,799 --> 01:25:10,415
I'm just a slave

1165
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,608
The land document was correct

I think you're misunderstood

1169
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,155
I ask you for advice?

1170
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:26,248
Not sir

Is this what?

1172
01:25:29,296 --> 01:25:30,528
This girlfriend is a friend of art

1173
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,456

1174
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:35,528
This is a great kind of people
How can i be my friend

1175
01:25:36,325 --> 01:25:40,014

!No? Thirty million is not what

1242
01:29:58,899 --> 01:29:59,892
This is the toilet of men

1243
01:30:00,172 --> 01:30:03,676
I can not do more than that
I tolerate torture

I did not do that

1251
01:30:21,694 --> 01:30:23,366
What do you know about abuse?

1252
01:30:24,093 --> 01:30:24,638
What is that

1253
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:27,620
I'm screaming now
And I say you're sexually abusive

1254
01:30:28,285 --> 01:30:30,542
.. The other is Satyrander Mi?ra, my case officer

1255
01:30:31,309 --> 01:30:32,502
I'm calling you illegitimate

1256
01:30:32,548 --> 01:30:33,434
That is the opportunism

1257
01:30:34,148 --> 01:30:34,691
Bring it down

1258
01:30:35,169 --> 01:30:36,657
No i do not say

1259
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:41,292
Because I'm not like that
I was not and not

1260
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:44,451
The results came
I did not understand Barat at the door

1261
01:30:44,724 --> 01:30:48,745
Your mother told my sister
I do not want to work, so what should I do?

1262
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:53,666
Some time ago you talked to me
You trusted me

1263
01:30:53,822 --> 01:30:54,446
Satinder

1264
01:30:54,642 --> 01:30:59,314
I loved you
Did not you think about me for a moment?

1265
01:31:01,362 --> 01:31:02,914
Now you come to see the tears?

1266
01:31:04,723 --> 01:31:08,430
What are my tears?
What are my mother's tears?

1267
01:31:08,805 --> 01:31:11,350
I agree
But what should I do now? what do I do?

1268
01:31:12,438 --> 01:31:16,014
What can you not tolerate?
What did i get

1269
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:18,781
Han
Did not you miss the pass?

1270
01:31:20,422 --> 01:31:23,934
But you once thought too
If I did not run away

1271
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:27,125
Did not you have this shakat today?

1272
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:28,494
what do you mean?

1273
01:31:28,805 --> 01:31:33,152
If you do not run away, you will not be able to sleep
And you were not an officer today

1274
01:31:33,985 --> 01:31:36,437
And you were still in the office
Did you think

1275
01:31:46,354 --> 01:31:49,462
Artistic Shukla
Today your truth turned out to be

1276
01:31:50,409 --> 01:31:53,977
You did not want to be an officer
Get married with a secretary

1277
01:31:54,548 --> 01:32:00,559
They were deductible to you, no?
I was younger, no?

1278
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:01,965
I did not deserve you

1279
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,186
I did not think so
Have you been chatting

1280
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:06,486
You were riding a state machine
I was not right for you

1281
01:32:07,044 --> 01:32:12,836
Arty Shukla you were selfish on that day
You are here

1282
01:32:14,955 --> 01:32:17,924
I did not mean Satynder
.. my room

1283
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:23,052
I'm talking to you
I'm not selfish

1284
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,388
Do you want me to go to jail again?

1285
01:32:27,956 --> 01:32:31,932
Call the police now instead of tomorrow
I'm going today

1286
01:32:34,836 --> 01:32:37,288
At least from this daily torture
I'll be saved

1287
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:41,030
I would not do it again, I accept that I got a bribe?

1288
01:32:48,446 --> 01:32:51,918
I will not do anything else
Call now

1289
01:32:52,565 --> 01:32:54,173
.. be honest!

1290
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:55,197
What am i to be

1291
01:32:56,426 --> 01:32:58,962
You want to talk
Okay, let's talk

1292
01:32:59,522 --> 01:33:00,948
You do not know what to say

1293
01:33:01,513 --> 01:33:02,409
I'm talking calmly

1294
01:33:04,338 --> 01:33:06,394
I do not really get any more

1295
01:33:07,802 --> 01:33:16,393
I'm sorry. Today I got a lot of nerves
I said you would drink me

1296
01:33:30,209 --> 01:33:34,308
How did this cigar start from?
Then I went to the thrill --

1297
01:33:35,024 --> 01:33:38,953
I did not know what I was doing
But let's get those old stories

1298
01:33:44,314 --> 01:33:49,267
Choose one

1299
01:33:55,769 --> 01:34:01,086
Can I kiss you?
What? --

1300
01:34:02,612 --> 01:34:03,396
Is it a buss

1301
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:08,682
I do not doubt you
No--

1302
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:16,455
I do not kiss you
You're killing me; it's deep and fashionable

1303
01:34:20,799 --> 01:34:28,190
And then there, let's go there
We stayed at night together

1304
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,109
Other, you have no problem
Do something

1305
01:34:33,809 --> 01:34:35,327
Do not you want
say

1306
01:34:36,156 --> 01:34:38,317
You know I was joking there
Not a joke right now --

1307
01:34:39,592 --> 01:34:42,310
Tonight the price of your imprisonment does not go away

1308
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:46,171
come

1309
01:34:51,134 --> 01:34:52,460
I misunderstood you

1310
01:34:57,886 --> 01:35:00,341
What was your second finger?

1311
01:35:02,246 --> 01:35:06,588
Today is ten minutes, one more week
The result of the committee will be announced

1312
01:35:06,754 --> 01:35:10,131
The thirty million buckets that hit
Send me to

1313
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:14,685
I am a part of the system
If I did not accept it, give me a boost

1314
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:17,347
I did not take bribes
I do not have 30 million

1315
01:35:17,965 --> 01:35:23,381
Get it out of Cork
! Do not refuse! You know all the facts about him

1316
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,739
See Shakla
You can not help this

1317
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:46,141
No sister, do not say so
Satyndar is not kid! His work must be with thought and intention--

1318
01:35:47,169 --> 01:35:53,721
Now it's said thirty million bugs
Where are we going to go? --

1319
01:35:53,918 --> 01:35:57,586
See, I did not have the right to take that day
I'm not here

1320
01:35:58,435 --> 01:36:04,764
One day I sold my gold
To save the lives of my husband and brother

1321
01:36:07,535 --> 01:36:09,500
Now you know what to sell
And John saved her daughter

1322
01:36:09,661 --> 01:36:12,848
I will sell myself too
Thirty Million

1323
01:36:13,192 --> 01:36:14,890
It's your problem

1324
01:36:18,922 --> 01:36:21,138
Come on, lady
Mr. Kokriya is waiting for you

1325
01:36:23,709 --> 01:36:24,628
I'll solve it

1326
01:36:26,896 --> 01:36:28,216
Come on, lady

1327
01:36:28,828 --> 01:36:35,287
I had days thinking I did not see you
But I heard a lot of you

1328
01:36:36,161 --> 01:36:40,162
Mr., if I am accused
I lose my job

1329
01:36:40,836 --> 01:36:42,821
My parents die
I'm taking prison

1330
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:44,696
You have to show yourself
And get the truth

1331
01:36:45,128 --> 01:36:46,500
The fact that everyone knows

1332
01:36:47,491 --> 01:36:50,180
Alexei is a naive role
Do not play in front of me

1333
01:36:50,426 --> 01:36:51,425
You have 30 crore money

1334
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,480
I got a bribe? Is it 30 crore?

1335
01:36:54,322 --> 01:36:55,519
You did not tell your employees?

1336
01:36:55,700 --> 01:37:00,253
Everybody left alone?
I gave you a little bit of subjection

1337
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:03,378
What do you say
I did not get any money from you

1338
01:37:04,428 --> 01:37:08,749
You must have one of your employees
I paid the money too

1339
01:37:09,293 --> 01:37:11,803
And now that you get caught up
Fall me down with you?

1340
01:37:12,764 --> 01:37:13,556
Eula Baba

1341
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,318
.. I have seen a lot of officers, but you

1342
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:28,046
Mrs. Shukla Case Investigation Officer

1343
01:37:29,058 --> 01:37:31.502
Just arrest him right now; yes, right now

1344
01:37:39,483 --> 01:37:45,248
It's not so much tougher
She's taking a revenge on her artistic work

1345
01:37:45,845 --> 01:37:52,081
We will try our last
Come on, I got everything

1346
01:37:52,137 --> 01:37:58,484
Go ahead it sooner
Trust in God --

1347
01:37:59,094 --> 01:38:00,398
Inshallah let them go

1348
01:38:02,332 --> 01:38:03,671
come

1349
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:19,407
See you. I'm somewhere
That you wanted me to give it

1350
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:24,540
Now the revenge is complete

1351
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:28,219
happy Birthday

1352
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:33,455
This is the best birthday party

1353
01:38:35,157 --> 01:38:35,853
Morsi

1354
01:38:42,114 --> 01:38:43,586
Sir

1355
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:50,142
I wish I had never seen you

1356
01:38:59,468 --> 01:39:04,091
This document is our homepage
Please save yours

1357
01:39:08,798 --> 01:39:11,790
I wanted all the evidence
I will solve the problem

1358
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:17,630
I want to get the Jouriary to get started
Come on --

1359
01:39:20,792 --> 01:39:22,264
A film where the answers are lucky

1360
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:27,726
Where did I write something?

1361
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:32,907
You are literally 30 million
And even the burqah is near and you want money again?

1362
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:34,575
Now this stupid movie you started
Stop it all

1363
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:36,716
Okay, I'll give you whatever you want

1364
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:39,795
Just a file that is due to your ignorance
Began to close

1365
01:39:44,189 --> 01:39:45,069
Say something?

1366
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:50,715
Not sir

1367
01:39:51,636 --> 01:39:52,653
I have nothing to say

1368
01:39:54,249 --> 01:39:55,793
Make every sentence you want

1369
01:40:02,148 --> 01:40:04,748
Mr. Kokriya, I'm not afraid of you

1370
01:40:05,391 --> 01:40:07,424
Even if you are imprisoned
I will not let you go

1371
01:40:10,981 --> 01:40:15,133
What does she say You said you traded
That's crazy!

1372
01:40:16,513 --> 01:40:19,377
I threatened to kill me
We need to do it

1373
01:40:19,745 --> 01:40:21,145
Draw it damn!

1374
01:40:22,855 --> 01:40:27,167
His former lover came to take revenge on him
Look like a hungry wolf

1375
01:40:27,527 --> 01:40:29,249
And in the end, we are hunting for it

1376
01:40:30,628 --> 01:40:32,857
This romantic series must be shut down

1377
01:40:34,066 --> 01:40:36,185
Kill it today

1378
01:40:49,781 --> 01:40:52,309
Can you explain Mr. Misrah?

1379
01:40:53,484 --> 01:40:54,710
Yes sir, I can

1380
01:40:56,313 --> 01:41:01,816
Mrs. Nilam Mamehma's husband and Rajai's dealer
Who has welded this deal

1381
01:41:02,543 --> 01:41:03,543
Are friends of childhood

1382
01:41:04,879 --> 01:41:08,254
State landless information
Mrs. Nilam is in charge of the office

1383
01:41:08,887 --> 01:41:09,769
And she gives her husband

1384
01:41:10,222 --> 01:41:13,215
Husband, she's going to remember Rajaj

1385
01:41:13,872 --> 01:41:16,893
He makes a hook piece for him
And it sells to several merchants at the same time

1386
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:19,612
Are you sure you?

1387
01:41:24,786 --> 01:41:27,833
Mrs. Nilam misuses Artem's trust
And sign it on the document

1388
01:41:30,361 --> 01:41:35,060
For years, they are called Artish Shukla
Bribe and split between them

1389
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:41,541
Cokria has given thirty million bribes
But Arty Shukla does not know at all

1390
01:41:43,149 --> 01:41:44,693
Because you never got the money

1391
01:41:51,166 --> 01:41:51,896
Are you Mrs. Nilam?

1392
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:55,240
Thankful

1393
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:09,188
Mrs. Mishra
Evidence is your claim

1394
01:42:09,545 --> 01:42:12,553
In the opinion of the Jury Board, Shukla is innocent

1395
01:42:17,433 --> 01:42:18,521
Arrest them

1396
01:42:19,089 --> 01:42:20,065
Yes sir

'I will endure all the sadness with you'

1416
01:44:54,715 --> 01:45:00,196
'I'll talk you with words that I'm not going to do with everyone.'

1417
01:45:03,627 --> 01:45:13,515
'Well, you ... how good are you?'

1418
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:19,403
'I want to be poor and Darwish love'

1419
01:45:20,299 --> 01:45:25,171
'Well, you ... how good are you?'

1420
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:41,376
'I want to be poor and Darwish love'

1421
01:45:48,529 --> 01:45:49,701
Where is the boss
Not yet --

1422
01:45:49,981 --> 01:45:51,357
Who is going
I do not know--

1423
01:45:53,453 --> 01:45:58,005
'I was careful thousands of times until I understood'

1424
01:45:58,733 --> 01:46:03,773
'You're running and I'm drinking'

1425
01:46:04,453 --> 01:46:07,121
'Loneliness where I can get there is yours'

1426
01:46:07,533 --> 01:46:10,561
'I realized for a hundred times that I accepted my story and your story.'

1427
01:46:11,089 --> 01:46:14,977
'When we get together, our communication becomes complete.'

1428
01:46:15,538 --> 01:46:25,065
'I want to see you again'

1429
01:46:25,489 --> 01:46:27,161
After all this happens
Anyone who thinks

1430
01:46:28,033 --> 01:46:31,508
If i was dying
I did not believe in love anymore

1431
01:46:31,858 --> 01:46:32,946
Your sister is upright

1432
01:46:33,402 --> 01:46:36,549
But I know Sato is still
I like too much

1433
01:46:37,346 --> 01:46:41,546
If he did not love, he would not hate so much
Who will be the officer and take revenge on me

1434
01:46:42,212 --> 01:46:45,036
Sato sister did not want to be an officer at all

1435
01:46:46,939 --> 01:46:50,363
The problem is just my brain
Do not fall in love with her

1436
01:46:51,635 --> 01:46:53,532
Now I make my mind silent

1437
01:46:53,891 --> 01:46:55,516
And I hear the sound of his heart

1438
01:46:57,276 --> 01:47:03,164
!listen! How much do you eat
I'm tired of daddy

1439
01:47:04,448 --> 01:47:07,992
I was rushed off by the officer
And you've been running my superiors

1440
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,131
Stop tired
We have to stop somewhere else

1441
01:47:12,751 --> 01:47:14,303
I'm going to get away

1442
01:47:15,192 --> 01:47:16,511
leave me
Our way is different from the two

1443
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:20,226
Our way is different
What is your goal?

1444
01:47:21,593 --> 01:47:26,034
Sato me down
I can not get faster than this

1445
01:47:28,554 --> 01:47:29,570
Come on!

1446
01:47:30,962 --> 01:47:31,530
Thank you sir

1447
01:47:41,923 --> 01:47:42,977
A moment

1448
01:47:45,306 --> 01:47:46,970
Do you bring me home?

1449
01:47:49,011 --> 01:47:50,503
Please, my car is ruined

1450
01:47:53,298 --> 01:47:53,925
Wash

1451
01:47:58,878 --> 01:47:59,614
Thankful

1452
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:00,878
You get him home

1453
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:02,445
Han Satyndar

1454
01:48:02,878 --> 01:48:04,064
Go

1455
01:48:13,838 --> 01:48:14,558
Where are you

1456
01:48:14,974 --> 01:48:17,494
It takes time to come

1457
01:48:18,086 --> 01:48:19,982
You got one of my two couriers

1458
01:48:23,766 --> 01:48:24,703
I came

1459
01:48:26,718 --> 01:48:29,182
I say you do not get me

1460
01:48:29,909 --> 01:48:32,048
But that does not mean
I can not eat whiskey

1461
01:48:32,704 --> 01:48:34,328
Wherever you are
I am in my place

1462
01:48:35,177 --> 01:48:36,407
Order me a drink

1463
01:48:37,173 --> 01:48:40,388
Come on, I'm drinking
You start

1464
01:48:41,311 --> 01:48:42,904
You are better than you

1465
01:48:47,226 --> 01:48:48,144
Miss Visky

1466
01:48:48,497 --> 01:48:53,063
Thank you ... crap ... it did not happen

1467
01:49:00,272 --> 01:49:06,620
There are some things
What are your goggles for me?

1468
01:49:08,424 --> 01:49:10,184
I'm attracted to not?
Please--

1469
01:49:10,655 --> 01:49:13,776
Mrs. your drink
Thankful--

1470
01:49:15,864 --> 01:49:24,496
I got a nice look
You are Tom Cruz Allah Abadi

1471
01:49:25,488 --> 01:49:27,408
Take a drink to the waiter

1472
01:49:27,656 --> 01:49:29,719
Art is on
One--only

1473
01:49:37,088 --> 01:49:37,992
..Husband

1474
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:43,400
I want to take your hand
And you turn around

1475
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:45,807
Please do not arrange
It's full of people here

1476
01:49:47,784 --> 01:49:52,827
Do you kiss me
One little one

1477
01:49:54,656 --> 01:49:56,831
Too much

1478
01:50:30,015 --> 01:50:31,400
Sato something to say?

1479
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:34,586
Under the pretext of the case
I saw you again

1480
01:50:35,315 --> 01:50:37,243
Otherwise maybe forever
I would give you

1481
01:50:47,031 --> 01:50:48,431
Do you feel like you're upset?

1482
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:52,655
I have not been there before

1483
01:50:54,879 --> 01:50:55,527
Let's go

1484
01:50:57,054 --> 01:51:01,383
Satyndar .. wait for Sato
I'm coming

1485
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:09,807
Artistic .. Be careful

1486
01:51:11,933 --> 01:51:13,198
I'm looking for you very much

1487
01:51:23,038 --> 01:51:26,647
Something to say Sato
Satinder

1488
01:51:29,998 --> 01:51:34,382
Tell me
I think I'm in love with you

1489
01:51:36,687 --> 01:51:38,147
Say i love you
Han

1490
01:51:44,423 --> 01:51:48,478
I love you so much
I want to marry

1491
01:51:49,814 --> 01:51:51,160
Because I saved you from prison?

1492
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:56,431
I saved you only from prison
I gave you too much time

1493
01:51:57,278 --> 01:52:02,735
I agree that my fault is ... Satinder

1494
01:52:06,474 --> 01:52:08,654
Reconcile again, please

1495
01:52:13,087 --> 01:52:14,516
Life is not strange?

1496
01:52:15,864 --> 01:52:18,633
My time is like divinities
I wanted to get it

1497
01:52:20,537 --> 01:52:24,073
I was thinking about you all day
What did you do

1498
01:52:25,569 --> 01:52:30,641
You escaped
.. you gotta And now you see

1499
01:52:34,619 --> 01:52:37,377
You know that day that my family's pride
I'm seeing breaking

1500
01:52:37,656 --> 01:52:39,616
I hated the word marriage from that day

1501
01:52:43,553 --> 01:52:47,260
And I'm not with you until the end of your life
I do not marry nobody

1502
01:52:48,595 --> 01:52:50,920
I understand it, thanks

1503
01:52:52,201 --> 01:53:02,564
The color of white love is not jealous. '
'And there is nothing inside of it

1504
01:53:03,095 --> 01:53:16,489
If you find one color too '
'The same white is everywhere, fire or sand

1505
01:53:22,817 --> 01:53:36,209
'It's the war you are your officer, I'll fight for you' '

1506
01:53:37,528 --> 01:53:42,563
'How good are you? How good are you?'

1507
01:53:43,014 --> 01:53:48,241
'I want poor love'

1508
01:53:54,467 --> 01:53:58,059
'I want to be with you'

1509
01:54:00,059 --> 01:54:04,459
'I will endure all sorrows with you'

1510
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:10,975
I want to say '
'I can not beat others, I'll kill you

1511
01:54:13,886 --> 01:54:21,130
I want to say '
'I can not beat others, I'll kill you

1512
01:54:25,322 --> 01:54:27,475
Danger
Yes sister--

1513
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:30,210
Do not you have reason?
What did I do? --

1514
01:54:30,694 --> 01:54:33,198
What did you write this
Did not you know the name of the groom?

1515
01:54:35,642 --> 01:54:37,287
Do you want to be an officer with this mess?

1516
01:54:37,683 --> 01:54:44,490
Sharada writes to Shara
Go make it up

1517
01:54:44,986 --> 01:54:47,442
Time seems to be blowing
You do not understand at all

1518
01:54:47,899 --> 01:54:50,410
Yeah, you have a fair deal, God

1519
01:54:50,966 --> 01:54:53,203
That girl escaped
And he is sitting alone here

1520
01:54:54,723 --> 01:54:57,666
Do you swear
We die without seeing our grandsons?

1521
01:54:59,152 --> 01:55:03,673
He who has a husband
Do you want to play with your children?

1522
01:55:03,921 --> 01:55:05,617
This is why this game is played? Wonderful

1523
01:55:05,889 --> 01:55:09,128
Of course you're right! How many girls
Can you keep your house

1524
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,384
You must have another wedding day

1525
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:13,615
I do not say I do not care
I told him

1526
01:55:14,646 --> 01:55:17,422
My son, let me die, my grandmother

1527
01:55:18,842 --> 01:55:25,457
Yeah, my son, your mother is right
We want to be a grandchild

1528
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:28,269
Do you have any questions for discussion?

1529
01:55:29,364 --> 01:55:31,484
This is very important to us
.. your love

1530
01:55:32,653 --> 01:55:33,653
Where are you now

1531
01:55:34,476 --> 01:55:35,604
On thursday
I'm going to the temple

1532
01:55:52,573 --> 01:55:56,941
how are you?
How are you? --

1533
01:55:57,887 --> 01:55:58,537
I am fine

1534
01:56:06,438 --> 01:56:07,602
I heard you're having a wedding

1535
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:11,776
I thought my case study
Are not I finishing a wedding?

1536
01:56:12,296 --> 01:56:16,620
No, make sure
Your life

1537
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:22,955
.. that .. shawl

1538
01:56:29,363 --> 01:56:31,699
I was thinking a few months ago

1539
01:56:31,971 --> 01:56:34,208
You told me you love me
And you want to be my wife

1540
01:56:34,825 --> 01:56:37,176
Yeah, I said, but you did not accept

1541
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:40,592
Yeah, you're a pragmatic girl

1542
01:56:42,272 --> 01:56:43,701
You're doing right right now

1543
01:56:44,103 --> 01:56:46,079
So all my life is waiting for you?

1544
01:56:46,582 --> 01:56:48,280
No, of course not

1545
01:56:49,657 --> 01:56:52,985
But I'm glad I decided not to marry

1546
01:56:53,865 --> 01:56:55,849
Otherwise, a girl like you would get stuck

1547
01:56:56,066 --> 01:56:57,653
Like me that does not get at all

1548
01:56:57,860 --> 01:57:00,291
I'm just a donna
And I'm having a husband

1549
01:57:01,671 --> 01:57:03,111
are your family OK?
Yeah--

1550
01:57:05,057 --> 01:57:05,671
Shariah

1551
01:57:07,622 --> 01:57:14,301
This is my friend and I'm Satyndar
A very old friend

1552
01:57:14,568 --> 01:57:20,248
I know Kayha; in fact, he does everything
Told you about

1553
01:57:20,856 --> 01:57:22,984
And I want to thank you

1554
01:57:24,729 --> 01:57:25,344
I did not do anything

1555
01:57:25,753 --> 01:57:27,487
Thanks for the same

1556
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:31,466
What if you married an artiste
What did I do?

1557
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:33,146
is not it?

1558
01:57:33,938 --> 01:57:35,371
I'm coming back now
A moment

1559
01:57:40,236 --> 01:57:43,828
Sharad ... you turn on the car

1560
01:57:46,349 --> 01:57:47,677
If you do not mind saying something

1561
01:57:47,693 --> 01:57:48,445
say

1562
01:57:49,861 --> 01:57:52,830
Do not marry arts
Not reliable

1563
01:57:53,956 --> 01:57:54,916
What does that mean?

1564
01:57:55,997 --> 01:57:57,740
Do not get upset, but do not be sad

1565
01:57:59,093 --> 01:58:03,291
Just a few days ago
The scenes followed me

1566
01:58:03,619 --> 01:58:04,522
.. and now see

1567
01:58:06,435 --> 01:58:10,442
I'm telling you a friend
If you get married with this, you will be poor

1568
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:14,421
Otherwise your life will be

1569
01:58:16,588 --> 01:58:18,572
Thank you so much

1570
01:58:20,465 --> 01:58:21,269
Come on!

1571
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:24,453
no thanks
.. Yours

1572
01:58:35,876 --> 01:58:37,509
How dare you satynder

1573
01:58:38,324 --> 01:58:41,222
I am a tail?
Shard with me?

1574
01:58:42,383 --> 01:58:43,959
What do you want from me?

1575
01:58:44,448 --> 01:58:47,743
You do not marry me
Do not let the rest of you marry me

1576
01:58:48,191 --> 01:58:48,897
what do I do?

1577
01:58:50,903 --> 01:58:51,631
do you love me?

1578
01:58:51,839 --> 01:58:54,566
Of course I love you
How many times say

1579
01:58:56,014 --> 01:58:57,597
So you love me
And getting married to someone else?

1580
01:58:58,741 --> 01:59:02,540
Ok do not you
Han

1581
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:04,685
Do you marry me?

1582
01:59:05,117 --> 01:59:07,501
You do not, because you do not allow me to

1583
01:59:08,434 --> 01:59:13,064
I decided to get married
Love is not obligatory for marriage

1584
01:59:13,907 --> 01:59:15,755
Love also arises after marriage

1585
01:59:17,419 --> 01:59:18,923
Come on tenth

1586
01:59:19,363 --> 01:59:20,113
I am not

1587
01:59:20,571 --> 01:59:23,171
Come on, I'm very happy

1588
01:59:54,363 --> 01:59:57,228
<i> <b> Make sure you come my wedding </ b> </ i>

1589
02:00:07,613 --> 02:00:08,339
Sato

1590
02:00:08,603 --> 02:00:09,623
Hurry shanti

1591
02:00:10,055 --> 02:00:11,967
Let's go
Take Mahish

1592
02:00:12,143 --> 02:00:13,305
See where you got to get started
