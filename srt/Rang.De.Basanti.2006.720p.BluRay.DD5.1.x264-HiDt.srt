1
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:25,814
If yet your blood does not rage..

2
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,856
..then it is water that flows in your veins.

3
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,189
For what is the flush of youth..

4
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,189
..if it is not of service to the motherland.

5
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:15,723
Just a minute Mr. McKinley,
one revolutionary is meeting another.

6
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,523
Thank you. Shall we go?

7
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:31,523
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

8
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:36,615
This isn't the end Mr. McKinley.
This is just the beginning.

9
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:40,315
There will be others after we have gone.
Many others.

10
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:53,704
I always believed that there were
two kinds of men in this world.

11
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:57,538
Men who go to their death screaming
and men..

12
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:03,038
..who go to their death in silence.

13
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:07,038
And then I met the third kind.

14
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,454
Sometimes in my dreams
I can still see them making their..

15
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:20,413
..long last walk.

16
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:22,413
They never so much as broke their stride.

17
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:26,288
They never faltered.

18
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:30,663
But above all others I remembered his eyes.

19
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:37,204
How they looked at me. Clear, defiant..

20
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:41,204
..never wavering.

21
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:20,546
It's time..

22
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,913
Hi.. - Hi..

23
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:13,913
Good morning..

24
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,913
Good morning. 
- Good morning.

25
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:26,558
So, Sonia, my contact in Delhi,
has gathered some information..

26
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,683
..and we have to wire her some money
to secure it.

27
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:33,683
Everything is cash up there.

28
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,267
Have I come to the wrong meeting?

29
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:43,017
We had directive from above, by Jacobs.

30
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:46,808
We had to make some very tough decisions.

31
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:50,850
Sorry Sue, I am really sorry.

32
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,475
If you do an episode on Gandhi
that would work for us..

33
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:57,225
You know Gandhi sells,
I suggest some fairy tales or even Robin Hood.

34
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:04,142
But these revolutionaries, Bhagat Singh,
Chandrashekhar Ali..

35
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:07,475
It's Azad, Chandrashekhar Azad and
Azad means freedom.

36
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,308
Azad sorry and I know what it means Sue.

37
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:11,267
I don't believe this,
everything has been set up..

38
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:12,808
..and I have been working on this
for the past two years.

39
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,850
I have been going to Hindi night classes.

40
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,308
Look..
- Please, their story deserves to be told.

41
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,808
This is my grandfather's diary.
He was an eye witness.

42
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,225
This is filled with real conversations.

43
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:31,392
Their very words.
Boys not older than 23 fighting the empire.

44
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:35,392
That's an important story.
A bloody important..

45
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:12,225
This is not the end Miss McKinley.

46
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,600
Sue.. Sue.

47
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,892
Can I talk to you?

48
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:22,308
Where are you going?
- To India, to shoot a documentary.

49
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:27,767
I'll send you a postcard.
- How? With what?

50
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:31,767
Your Mother's eye.

51
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,975
Are you talking or hijacking her?

52
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:07,350
Get out of the way! Scoot!

53
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,475
First time in India, madam? Don't worry.
- Yes! No..

54
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:13,308
Are you married?
Even I and my wife are married.

55
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:16,600
Sue, you don't have to worry he is with me.

56
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,308
Yeah, I am with her..
With me.

57
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:20,892
Oh, it's so good to see you.

58
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,225
I can't believe it you are here.
That it's happening at last.

59
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,767
Sorry about the short notice.

60
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:31,183
Mind-blowing! Your Hindi has really improved.
- Thank you.

61
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:51,100
Hey Sue, no need to worry..

62
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,225
All the preparations are done.

63
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,267
..posters have been put up everywhere.

64
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,350
It's also been announced on radio.

65
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,475
just see, they'll be lining up for the auditions.

66
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,392
What's wrong?

67
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:13,183
I didn't tell you.
The truth is that I've come alone.

68
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:17,183
..no money, no producer is going to arrive.

69
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:21,058
I know.
- You knew it!

70
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:26,350
After Alice, there was a call from Beth Williams..

71
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,392
..she informed me of the cancellation of the show..

72
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:32,725
..and also my services.

73
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:39,183
By the way, did you abuse her in Hindi?

74
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,392
She wanted to know what it meant.

75
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,392
I explained to her in graphic detail.

76
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,642
You are amazing... Sonia.

77
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:06,517
What's that?
- That's the Red Fort.

78
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:19,933
This is Delhi University.
Let me help you with your luggage.

79
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:24,267
How much?
- Ma'am I've already told you.

80
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,475
No, no..
- I can help.

81
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:27,850
Thanks Ravi, you are a sweetheart.

82
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,100
Ravi, please get all the luggage to our room.
- Fine.

83
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Thank you.

84
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:39,808
Hello which country, madam
- India, I hope.

85
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:52,933
Your room.
- Okay.

86
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,892
Get some rest now.
I'll see you tomorrow..

87
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:00,475
..If you need anything you have my number.

88
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:03,183
Thanks.
- Okay.

89
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:07,850
Let's go Ravi.

90
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,433
My Grandpa was right..

91
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:14,433
..he said when you come to India,
it's love at first sight.

92
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,100
Hi this is Dabbo speaking.
And my hobbies..

93
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,100
..are bikes, babes and body building.

94
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:58,517
"Little child what do you behold in your infant hands.."

95
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:04,892
"Little child what do you behold in your infant hands.."

96
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:08,183
Oh no!

97
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:10,642
I can't do this.

98
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:14,142
Listen...
- Just try once.

99
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:18,183
I can't do this.

100
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:26,642
I deserve a role
because I have dimples just like Priety Zinta.

101
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:30,600
"When flowers in the garden bloom.."

102
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,600
"Jana, Gana, Mana, Vande Matram.."

103
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,519
Because women
can make possible impossible..

104
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,186
..impossible possible.

105
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:02,436
I love you.

106
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:04,228
Hi, how's that?

107
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,144
"When flowers in the garden bloom.."

108
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:10,019
Don't sing. Just recite "Vande Matram".
- Vande Matram?

109
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,019
"Vande Matram Jana, Gana, Mana.."
"Vande Matram Jana, Gana, Mana.."

110
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:24,103
Rascal, if you have the guts then come out.

111
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,394
Everyone calls me Bhai..

112
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,186
Raise your hand and say Vande Matram!
- Vande Matram!

113
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:32,061
Speak loudly, Vande Matram!
- Vande Matram.

114
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,686
Loudly and proudly, Vande Matram!
- Vande Matram

115
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:38,019
Vande Matram!
- Vande Matram..

116
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,811
I know about the fight.

117
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,644
I have dedicated my life to the freedom of this nation.

118
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,061
I have dedicated my life to the freedom of this nation.

119
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:47,728
I know you want me to get married.

120
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:51,269
..but Freedom is my bride.

121
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,269
I know.. I know.. that..

122
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:02,269
I know.. that you want me to get married..

123
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,478
..but my bride is Freedom

124
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:08,019
..but my bride is Freedom.

125
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,269
Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh.

126
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:12,644
Bhagat Singh.

127
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,103
Bhagat Singh.
- Anybody.

128
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:15,519
Bhagat Singh.

129
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,478
My turn.
- My turn.

130
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:21,478
My name is Bhagat Singh.
Inquilab Zindabad.

131
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:31,457
Tea!
- Thanks.

132
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,207
Depressed huh?

133
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:40,957
One or two of them can be used for minor roles..

134
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:45,123
..but no one's even close for Azad or
Bhagat Singh.

135
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:48,498
I guess it's all my fault.

136
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:54,998
No Sonia. You're my rock.
It's my fault. I should have never come.

137
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,415
Sue, don't get so dejected.

138
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,248
I think we need a break.

139
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:02,873
Let's go and have some fun.
- I'm in no mood Sonia.

140
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,748
We are going to the classroom.
- Classroom.

141
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:09,748
Lose control.

142
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:18,832
Lose control.

143
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:21,957
One more chance, Lose.. lose..

144
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:25,957
Lose control.

145
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:30,248
C'mon..

146
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,248
Lose control.

147
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:36,373
Mr. Poet..
- Hey Sonia.

148
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:40,290
What's happening?

149
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,707
How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

150
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,123
Aslam.. Sue McKinley.
- Hi.

151
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:48,707
You too study at the University?

152
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,998
Wow! Her Hindi is great.

153
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:52,540
We live there, eat there..

154
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,498
..but no one has ever accused us of studying there.

155
00:16:56,998 --> 00:17:01,957
What do you say Sonia?
- Come.

156
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:04,665
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

157
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:11,623

00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:18,040

DJ! DJ! DJ!..

160
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:26,498
Who are those maniacs?

161
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:27,873
That's DJ..

162
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,998
DJ I love you!!!

163
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:35,832
That's Sukhi.

164
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:41,498
Let's rock it!

165
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:43,998
DJ I love you!!!

166
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:48,748
I love you too baby!

167
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:50,248
Hey, bring it. .

168
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:52,707
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

169
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,248
- What are you doing?

170
00:17:55,748 --> 00:18:00,165
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

171
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,415
Damn exhibitionists.

172
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,332
They'll never change.

173
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:13,998
Come on dude, let's rock it!
- Let's do it.

174
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:16,832
Come on, Sukhi.
Show everyone.

175
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,832
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

176
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:30,665
Is he OK?

177
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:42,998
Is he OK?

178
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,998
That's his natural pose.

179
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:48,707
Hey, pal.
- DJ.

180
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:52,957
Sukhi, all parts working?
- DJ!

181
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:58,998
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Who is this?

182
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:03,415
Sue this is DJ. DJ this is Sue.
- Hi!

183
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:07,707
Sue? She's so pink her name should be Gulabo (Rose).
- DJ.

184
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,873
She's quite hot..

185
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:16,373
I mean it's very cold.

186
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:24,290
Karan you saved my life. I love you!
- Love you too, Sukhi.

187
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,873
Aslam..

188
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,415
..you too saved my life,

189
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:30,207
I love you too!

190
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:34,207
It's ok.

191
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:37,832
She must have saved my life too..

192
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,248
No! Sukhi! She didn't save your life.

193
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:43,332
No problem. One day she'll save my life.

194
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:52,498
Coming...
- Hey brother, take a hike. She is your sister-in-law.

195
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:56,498
"One more time.." "Lose Control.."

196
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:09,207
"Lose Control."

197
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:16,123
"I'm a Rebel.."

198
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:23,540
"I am a rebel."

199
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,040
"There's aren't any students here, no teachers to suffer.."

200
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:36,207
"There's aren't any students here, no teachers to suffer.."

201
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:39,498
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

202
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:43,498
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

203
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:54,248
"Lose Control.."

204
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:58,040
Sukhi you just sit and watch like a dumb-ass..

205
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,373
DJ doesn't waste a second.

206
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:00,832
He's a stud.

207
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:04,498
Hi! How's everybody?
Hi Rahul! What's up?

208
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,248
Got a few gigs lined up.

209
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:07,915
How's your radio thing going?

210
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:09,998
Its not Radio thing, it is Radio Jockey.

211
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:11,207
Did anything work out?

212
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,748
All India Radio has given me a night slot.

213
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:15,707
Means your scene is shaping up!

214
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:20,457
Not really.
When the whole world's sleeping I'm on air.

215
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:22,957
But people stay up late..

216
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:27,498
Criminals, insomniacs, watchmen and idiots!

217
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:28,998
Have your fun at my expense.

218
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,998
Speaking of expenses.. Can I..

219
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:35,998
Trial Job, No income.

220
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:42,248
Thanks man, thanks a lot.

221
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:46,415
See you guys.
Got a cigarette?

222
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:50,665
Okay, see you. Take care, thanks.

223
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,040
Fabulous!
- Leave it.

224
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,040
It's my Dad's money. He's got loads of it..

225
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:07,540
Stop this Western music, this obscenity!

226
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,832
How many times do I have to make you understand this!

227
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:13,623
Polluting the culture of this country..

228
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:16,498
Leave this place right now. Leave!

229
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:21,540
Can't you understand, bastard!

230
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,207
This is your last warning..

231
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:28,873
..from now on, nobody plays any
Western music out here.

232
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:32,707
No lewd dancing!

233
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:38,623
It is better you listen or
I'll break your legs.

234
00:22:39,123 --> 00:22:41,832
Who are you to warn us?
If you don't like it, don't come here.

235
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:45,832
You bloody Pakistani!

236
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:53,873
Let's finish it.

237
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:07,207
Hey, empty this place.

238
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,623
Last warning! Got it?

239
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,623
Long live India!

240
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:26,207
Get up. Empty this place or we will arrest you.

241
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,957
You touch Aslam and see what I do to you..

242
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:33,540
..even your mother won't recognize you.

243
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,123
Ever seen a baboons arse?

244
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,998
Yours will be as red after I've finished with you.

245
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:43,248
Sir, I'm sure we can work it out. Come here.
No matter..

246
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:48,873
You think too much of yourself don't you?

247
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:53,582
Keep this..

248
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,915
Was that a bribe?

249
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:57,832
Welcome to India Sue!

250
00:23:58,332 --> 00:24:05,498
Anyone hungry? I'm famished.

251
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:07,498
Hey Sue, want a ride?

252
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:11,498
You've got insurance?

253
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,800
Karan..

254
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,259
Love you..

255
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:55,725
Shit!

256
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:57,755
Almost, almost..

257
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:01,672
You..!

258
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:04,089
How're you?

259
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:10,172
Hey honey! Come here you..

260
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,922
If something happened to you, I'd have killed you.

261
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:18,005
Is this any way to greet your boyfriend?

262
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:19,214
How're you?

263
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:22,172
Hey, how are you?
- I am fine, how are you?

264
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:24,880
Mr. Rathod...
 - Aslam, you keep growing tall.

265
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,005
Stop acting..

266
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,339
Sexy jacket, bro.
- It is.

267
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,630
Hi, Ajay..
- Hi.

268
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,839
Flight lieutenant Ajay Rathod.
- She's right.

269
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:36,130
Hurry guys, I'm famished.

270
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,630
You won't get any food here.

271
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,047
Hey Mitro, my mother, how are you?
- Your Mitro is dead.

272
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:44,339
Stay away!
You remembered your mother after two months..

273
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,672
..I carried you in my stomach for nine months..

274
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,130
..and washed your bum for years..

275
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,547
..and you come here as being a gentleman.

276
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:51,755
Get lost!

277
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:55,297
Does anyone bother to check
if Mitro is alive or dead?

278
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:56,839
What's up?

279
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:58,297
You're drunk again.

280
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:01,255
No. No. No.
- One is in military and other keeps enjoying.

281
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:05,130
First give us food ma, and then yell at us all night.

282
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,630
None of you have eaten?
What will happen to this generation?

283
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,297
Sonia you've lost even more weight.
- Really.. Mitro

284
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,380
The girls of today have more bones and less flesh..

285
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,172
How will you bear children?

286
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:21,289
How will you bear children?

287
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:25,755
Aslam, how are you my son?
I didn't notice you.

288
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:28,547
He is my true son who bothers to check on me.

289
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:33,922
And he is one...
I committed a mistake by sending you to city.

290
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:37,297
Look ma, what I brought for you.

291
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:42,130
Your daughter-in-law.
Her name is Sue.

292
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,089
What? A foreigner?

293
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,297
Brought her especially from London.

294
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:48,589
That's why I was away for so long.

295
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:51,714
I told her that's it's your first trip to India.

296
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,589
Give me your blessings Ma.

297
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,380
Your son's such a brat.

298
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,880
God! She understands Hindi!

299
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,380
She understands everything.

300
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,380
You really understand everything?
- Yes.

301
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,672
What a problem!

302
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:18,089
I'm going off to sleep.
Your beds are all ready.

303
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:22,130
No need to drive so late at night.

304
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,714
I saw them then..

305
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:28,714
..like they leapt out of the pages
of grandpa's dairy.

306
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:52,130
Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad,
Rajguru ..

307
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,630
..and Durga Bhabhi, Asfaqulla Khan

308
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,755
And they were sitting right in front of me.

309
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:02,922
Sue, where are you?

310
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:05,130
Will you guys act in my film?

311
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,380
What?

312
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,380
Will you guys act in my film?
You all are perfect.

313
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,255
Hey, why are you guys laughing?
I'm the hero of her film.

314
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,297
Yeah we guys are champions when it comes to acting..

315
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:20,505
..clowning around is all they do.

316
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:22,089
I am serious okay.

317
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:25,422
The four of you will be perfect for the roles of Bhagat Singh..

318
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:28,297
..Chandrashekar Azad, Ashfaqulla Khan, Rajguru.

319
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:30,339
And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.

320
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,839
She really knows Hindi!

321
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,130
All this talk of patriotism is boring.

322
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,630
Boring? These guys gave their lives
for the freedom of your country.

323
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,339
What freedom?
Have you seen the state of this country?

324
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,672
No one believes this rubbish thing.

325
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:49,255
Excuse me!
I believe in this country, Karan.

326
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,672
Otherwise, why would I be fighting for it?
- I don't know.

327
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:55,922
Maybe because it's cool!
Being a pilot.. flying an expensive plane.

328
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:57,255
You get to wear fancy jackets..

329
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:01,464
And the women.. women love men in uniforms.

330
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:04,255
Sure I love being a pilot. Sure it's cool.

331
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:08,589
But I also feel proud of my country,
and I can give my life for it.

332
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:11,797
Proud of what?

333
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:13,005
..this country's exploding population?

334
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,630
..or unemployment..
- or corruption?

335
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,339
Which of these are you really proud of?

336
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,630
Come on guys..

337
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,880
..no country's perfect Karan.
We've got to make it better.

338
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,297
Right.

339
00:30:23,797 --> 00:30:26,589
Ok, Ajay you make this country perfect.

340
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:30,880
The minute I get my degree
I'm out of this dump..

341
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,089
You won't be able to leave us and go.
- Wait and see.

342
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:38,755
She speaks Hindi so well!

343
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,964
Why didn't you tell me you son of a bitch..

344
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:45,964
..I was making a fool of myself.

345
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,292
At least ask them once, please.

346
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,084
So you won't give up.

347
00:30:56,584 --> 00:31:00,292
Ok. But nobody will turn up.

348
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,392
They will come.
I'll get them.

349
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:07,016
That's a promise.

350
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:16,167
Karan, put your cigarette out.

351
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,959
Greetings grandpa!

352
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,292
God bless you. When did you come?

353
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:28,542
Just last night. Some friends.

354
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:32,542
Who is he?
- DJ's grandfather.

355
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:44,126
Bye.
- Bye Mitro.

356
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:48,126
You...

357
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:14,334
Good morning Karan.
Back so early?

358
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,626
I didn't know you were in town.

359
00:32:18,126 --> 00:32:19,917
Just arrived an hour ago.

360
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,876
It was a long flight.

361
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,167
Everything Ok at college?
- Everything's fine Dad.

362
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,084
Have you decided which American university..

363
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:31,167
..you want to go to next year?

364
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,542
Michigan university,
it's a famous university.. then there's..

365
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:36,751
Carnegie Mellon, Wharton..

366
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,751
I know the list.

367
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:46,542
Hello.. Karan wait!

368
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:52,834
I can't hear you clearly call me later.
 I told you to call later.

369
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:56,751
I know that you know about the lists.

370
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,542
But life doesn't just happen to you.

371
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:02,167
You've got to plan it..

372
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:07,292
Every second someone is born
in this country's drainage.

373
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:10,751
Nobody cares about them.
Neither the government nor God.

374
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:13,417
I don't want.

375
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:16,667
Do something.
Or else you will be one of them.

376
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,751
Please, don't start with your lectures.

377
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:23,959
SMS generation.
Any conversation that goes beyond..

378
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:27,001
..four lines becomes a lecture.

379
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:29,001
Hello..

380
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:35,459
Signal's weak here give me a second.
I will just go out and talk.

381
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:41,292
Yes, tell me.
The deal is off then, we are not interested..

382
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,459
You are wasting my time.

383
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,876
You know Russian quality is doubtful..

384
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:47,334
..they can't afford to be arrogant.

385
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,501
It is a profitable deal.

386
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:53,959
Anyway in the open market
they'd not get half of it.

387
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:59,584
And you know how many fathers there..

388
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:05,959
..are to every deal in India.

389
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:07,792
Nothing.

390
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:11,792
Tell them we won't bargain,
they should wire the money to us.

391
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,501
I did try to warn you.. they won't turn up.

392
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,209
DJ promised me.

393
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:41,251
Oh! DJ promised you!

394
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,001
So you really are a filmmaker?

395
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:47,709
Karan.. Why are you so late?

396
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:51,876
And where are the others?

397
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:59,001
The Young Guns Of India.
Very dramatic.

398
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:01,959
Where are you going?

399
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:05,001
Well that's one part cast.

400
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:09,001
I am sure Karan can tell us
where his friends are.

401
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:23,417
How are you? I am fine.
I am preparing omelets.

402
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:26,167
She's an eight. Yeah! Wow! Nine.

403
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,834
What a girl!
Oye Chotu get me a cup of tea..

404
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:35,042
Two, tell her to go..

405
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:36,417
Six..

406
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:42,001
Ten! What?
- Ten from far and enough from close,

407
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:46,501
Dude.. looks at those legs!

408
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:49,834
Shake it baby, shake it..

409
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:51,251
Oh shit!

410
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:52,917
Don't be silly, that's at least an eight.

411
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,126
Thought I'd find you stuffing your faces.

412
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:58,959
You lazy good for nothings.

413
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,334
We were about to come.. but..

414
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:03,334
..we are waiting for Karan actually.

415
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:05,501
Oh! So you were waiting for Karan.
- Yes.

416
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,876
Karan was there on time.
..Yeah!

417
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,959
We are waiting for him here
and he was waiting for us there.

418
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:16,459
We were supposed to meet here.
- What confusion..

419
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,751
You're Ashfaqulla Khan.

420
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,042
You're Rajguru.
- The hero right!

421
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:22,751
And you know who you are?

422
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:25,459
The Master of Disguise and Deception.

423
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,792
Chandrashekhar Azad.

424
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,584
I will die on you.

425
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,792
Learn the lines properly, we meet tomorrow.

426
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,626
The practice will be tomorrow
at 8 a.m. sharp!

427
00:36:36,126 --> 00:36:38,167
Nine.
- Sharp at eight.

428
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:42,167
That's fine.
- We've already wasted a day..

429
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:50,167
Aslam, your sister-in-law looks
even better when she's angry.

430
00:36:50,667 --> 00:37:01,292
I have fallen in love.

431
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:03,292
What are you doing Laxman?

432
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,501
Party High Command is really happy with your work.

433
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:15,209
These demonstrations that you have started
against Western culture..

434
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:20,167
..they've helped us
overshadow other parties.

435
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,167
Come. Come.

436
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:29,126
Give me.
- Take this.

437
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:32,584
This is for you.
And this is for your boys.

438
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,834
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

439
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:37,251
I'm not doing this for money.

440
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:40,792
I really believe in the principles of my party.

441
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,834
That's fine Laxman..

442
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:49,667
..but every movement needs fuel...
Keep it.

443
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:55,834
Come, how is your work going on?

444
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:59,501
March the 14th we started our rehearsals.

445
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:03,501
To say I was nervous,
would be an understatement.

446
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:15,634
"There is nothing you can do to break me."

447
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:19,042
"Because I have made pain my friend."

448
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:23,042
"..As I hold Death's fingers."

449
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:38,176
DJ idiot, don't spoil my concentration.

450
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:42,459
Please guys, be serious.
- Okay, sorry..

451
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:47,626
Look, Death's finger.

452
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,542
"I've committed my life to the freedom of this country.

453
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,626
..I know you want me to get married..

454
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:54,626
..but I have made freedom my bride.."

455
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,751
"Your son, Bhagat Singh."

456
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:01,584
Who talks like this for God's sake?
- Your son.

457
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:03,667
My bride is freedom...
what's his problem?

458
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,126
I think it's a good line for Sukhi..

459
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:07,667
Since no girl is ever going to marry him..

460
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,792
Let freedom be his bride.

461
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:12,917
Laugh bastards, laugh.
I won't invite you in my marriage.

462
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,917
You were happy just now and
now you turned sad.

463
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:28,459
"What sign did you make by touching my heart?"

464
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:34,542
"The climate has changed and
I have started liking the environment.."

465
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,292
Wow! Great!

466
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,709
This is the sari round of the
Miss Freedom contest.

467
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:43,626
Just thought it would help me get into the character.

468
00:39:44,126 --> 00:39:46,167
Wow!
- Idiots.

469
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,126
Hey, Miss Universe .. ..ity.

470
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,959
Look guys this isn't going to work.

471
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:56,709
You have to work hard to bring out the characters.
And be serious.

472
00:39:57,209 --> 00:40:00,751
Unless you emote from within..

473
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:03,876
..you won't understand these characters.

474
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:09,042
Try.. it will come from within you.

475
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:12,334
See, he's got a hold of his character already.

476
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:15,542
You understood the character pretty fast.

477
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:17,834
Please stop it. Just shut up or get out.

478
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:21,126
See! Now you look like a revolutionary!

479
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:25,001
Whatever you say Gulabo,
you need me to create the mood.

480
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:27,167
DJ watch it.

481
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:31,626
Now she's upset!
She's is upset..

482
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:36,084
She is smiling, she will be allured if she smiles.

483
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:40,167
Those are the words of a 23 year old.

484
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:43,917
That's how old Bhagat Singh
was when he died: 23.

485
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,084
Those were different times Sue.

486
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:47,834
Today, if you tell people that you ..

487
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:49,834
..want to give your life for your country..

488
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:54,001
..they'll call you mad.

489
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:56,051
Exactly.

490
00:40:56,551 --> 00:41:01,259
I can't relate to this..

491
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,334
That's it.
Don't think.

492
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:09,459
Feel. Just read the words,
and you'll get what he was feeling.

493
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,584
Why don't we try again?

494
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:15,334
Let's try again..

495
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:21,626
I've committed my life to the freedom of this country.
- Good.

496
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:27,751
..a job.. a well settled life...
these things don't matter anymore.

497
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:35,251
..I know you want me to get married..

498
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:39,251
..but I have made freedom my bride..

499
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:52,285
I the son Mother India..
swear on this..

500
00:41:59,076 --> 00:42:07,660
I the son Mother India..
swear on this pious fire..

501
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,535
This Aslam is a real stud..

502
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:17,535
Take a look at the packaging.
Poetry, good looks, reading hands!

503
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:23,743
DJ, I'm scared at times that
I'll remain a bachelor all my life.

504
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:28,076
Trust me I won't let you die a bachelor.

505
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:32,326
Promise...
- It's DJ's promise.

506
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:34,160
Oh no.

507
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,493
"You'll be writing people's destinies..

508
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:40,035
.." "You'll be bringing them on right path.."

509
00:42:40,535 --> 00:42:43,535
Papu, change the channel.
- "You know the art of changing destiny.."

510
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:47,535
"You have to go far beyond the lines.." 
 I like that.

511
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:54,335
Your love line is very strong..

512
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:58,201
The man of your dreams will come along
in a black T-shirt and say:.

513
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:03,618
"What sign did you make by touching my heart.."

514
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:07,160
Do I even have a love line?

515
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,951
You must have washed it off in the loo.

516
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:11,951
"Defence Minister Shastri has also been implicated

517
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:14,701
in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandal,"

518
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:19,201
This is really depressing nonsense.
Let's go DJ.

519
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:23,201
"This is a blatant lie.
I am ordering an investigation."

520
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:31,785
"To the Mahal of the Taj..."

521
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:34,918
"To the Minar of Kutub.."

522
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:38,068
"To the Kumari of Kanya.."

523
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,535
"To the beaches of Goa.."

524
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:44,910
"To the whole of India, Zindabad.."

525
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,785
"All have something to say.."

526
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:49,410
"They all have something to say.."

527
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,826
"All have something to say.."

528
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:56,826
"They all have something to say.."

529
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:02,910
"India and Pakistan,
Bangladesh all in a song.."

530
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,576
"Kajurao in Coimbatore.."

531
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:09,451
"Everyone all around say,
our school is a school for fun.."

532
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:12,743
"..everyone all around say,
our school is a school for fun.."

533
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:14,410
"To all the corners of the earth."

534
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,035
"To what is all our worth."

535
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:20,035
"What is out destiny?"

536
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,743
"From the King of India
up to the Himalayas."

537
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:29,076
"Across the Ganga Jamuna."

538
00:44:29,576 --> 00:44:33,076
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

539
00:44:34,993 --> 00:44:39,493
"Lose control.."

540
00:44:58,185 --> 00:44:59,519
Bye.
- Bye.

541
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:00,769
See you guys.

542
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:04,852
You're my buddy...
 I'll drop you home.

543
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:08,227
I don't need any help, it's just two lanes away.
 You just sit calmly.

544
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:12,227
We are not so drunk...
not to remember your home.

545
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,935
We are not so drunk...
not to remember your home.

546
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:27,935
Idiots!

547
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:31,935
You're very lucky to have friends like them.

548
00:45:36,352 --> 00:45:39,394
One day this will all end.

549
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:42,560
We'll all go our separate ways.

550
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,894
But you can always keep in touch.

551
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:48,310
Doesn't happen.

552
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,644
Life gets busy.

553
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:55,227
Too many problems.
Getting a job, a house, money.

554
00:45:55,727 --> 00:45:59,227
And then dance to the tune of life.

555
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:08,352
In college we rule our destinies..

556
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:12,352
But after college we have
to dance to fate's tune.

557
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:24,144
You know Gulabo, I passed out 5 years ago..

558
00:46:24,644 --> 00:46:26,102
..but I still hang around..

559
00:46:26,602 --> 00:46:29,394
I don't understand.

560
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:33,644
..I don't ever want to leave college.

561
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:36,560
Why?

562
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,227
At least in the campus I'm someone...
people know me.

563
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:46,435
DJ's somebody..

564
00:46:46,935 --> 00:46:53,852
People expect me to
do something big in life.

565
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:57,852
But when I'm out on the streets..

566
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,019
It's all the beer's fault...
Everything came out.

567
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:30,060
You know what else I'm scared of?

568
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,269
Acting in your film.

569
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:37,269
Don't worry.. you're in safe hands.

570
00:47:46,102 --> 00:47:49,435
"My friend is tall but his lane is small."

571
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:52,935
It's Aslam's lane.
- Mind you watch it. I am Muhamad Ali.

572
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:56,352
Don't be silly. Muhamad Ali.
- Don't be silly.

573
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:59,269
Where have you been?

574
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:03,069
Hello Uncle..

575
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:09,102
We'll catch up tomorrow Aslam..

576
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:13,102
Let's go.

577
00:48:17,419 --> 00:48:18,960
You've been drinking?

578
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,627
Father, you know I don't drink.

579
00:48:23,227 --> 00:48:26,269
Good-for-nothings..
- Whatever, they're my friends.

580
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:30,227
Friends!
They feel no shame standing in front of..

581
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:33,435
..your father with alcohol on their breath.

582
00:48:33,935 --> 00:48:36,685
Why can't you get friends
in your own community?

583
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:38,352
Why do you make friends with people who...

584
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:40,394
..corrupt you, disgrace your religion..

585
00:48:40,894 --> 00:48:42,352
This has nothing
to do with religion, Father.

586
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:48,477
Shut up!
Don't raise your voice in the presence of your father.

587
00:48:48,977 --> 00:48:51,185
He's right.

588
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:57,435
This country has never
accepted Muslims and it never will..

589
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,394
How can you be so passive!

590
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:04,269
Do you ever see me mixing with a Hindu?
Have you ever seen?

591
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:09,935
I'm not you and I don't want
to be like you brother.

592
00:49:10,435 --> 00:49:12,185
I can't fill myself with so much hate..

593
00:49:12,685 --> 00:49:14,685
Coward that's what you are.

594
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,435
Stop it!

595
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:18,685
I feel suffocated in this house.
It's the same ..

596
00:49:19,185 --> 00:49:22,685
..old thing every single day...

597
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:35,090
Carnivals will be held
on our graves every year,

598
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,256
That's all that will be left of us,
when we die for our country.

599
00:49:39,756 --> 00:49:42,465
Well said.
- Well said Ashfaq Sahab..

600
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:44,090
If the English could hear you they would ..

601
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,298
..leave this country in a moment.

602
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:49,465
So what has been decided?

603
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:56,340
We'll steal the Empire's money from the train that passes Kakori.

604
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,548
And with that money we will buy arms.

605
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:01,881
Bismil will explain everything.

606
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:05,006
Yes Bismil.. Where is my Ram?

607
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,506
Where is my Ram?

608
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,756
I just can't find my Ramprasad Bismil.

609
00:50:10,256 --> 00:50:11,506
Relax. We will find him.

610
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:13,465
But where? How?

611
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:16,215
Very soon. Don't you wo..

612
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:18,048
Oh no.

613
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:21,423
You won't get Ramprasad Bismil out here.

614
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:24,506
You need a true Indian.

615
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:27,006
How can you find Indian revolutionaries amongst..

616
00:50:27,506 --> 00:50:30,090
..people who want to be Westerners?

617
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,798
Ignore him. Let's go.

618
00:50:32,298 --> 00:50:37,131
Ramprasad Bismil wished
to be reborn a hundred times..

619
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:40,631
..so that he could give his life
for his country a hundred times over.

620
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:42,881
Let's go from here Su.

621
00:50:43,381 --> 00:50:46,881
So where do you think I can find my Bismil?

622
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,423
I don't believe this.

623
00:50:56,923 --> 00:51:02,840
'The desire to rebel now fills our hearts'

624
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:09,173
'We have yet to test the strength
of the murderer's might'

625
00:51:09,673 --> 00:51:13,256
'Why does he not say a word?

626
00:51:13,756 --> 00:51:20,048
'The one in my sights has his lips sealed'

627
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:25,048
'O martyrs, O men of valour,
I'd give my life for you'

628
00:51:25,548 --> 00:51:30,423
'In every lane even the enemy sings
your praise these days'

629
00:51:30,923 --> 00:51:35,048
'When the time will come,
we shall show you, O sky'

630
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:40,631
'What is the point in speaking now
of what lies in our hearts?'

631
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,798
' They drag us all together
in hope of execution'

632
00:51:45,298 --> 00:51:48,881
'Those fired by passion are gathered
in the murderer's lane'

633
00:51:49,381 --> 00:51:53,715
'We have yet to test the strength of
the murderer's might'

634
00:51:54,215 --> 00:52:00,923
The desire to rebel now fills our hearts

635
00:52:01,423 --> 00:52:04,923
' We have yet to test the strength
of the murderer's might'

636
00:52:19,506 --> 00:52:21,923
Sue, this isn't London.
You don't know what kind..

637
00:52:22,423 --> 00:52:23,215
..of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.

638
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:27,465
Look Sue if he is a part of this,
then I can't do the film.

639
00:52:27,965 --> 00:52:30,715
If you have any problems with me say it on my face.

640
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:35,006
Don't stab me in the back like a coward.

641
00:52:35,506 --> 00:52:38,256
Pandey leave! We don't want trouble..

642
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:41,840
Speak you coward. What were you saying?

643
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:47,131
Aslam, sit here. Where are you going?

644
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,506
Bastard, what were you saying?

645
00:52:49,006 --> 00:52:51,840
Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam

646
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,506
Don't spare him.

647
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:57,173
Sukhi! - Stop it please.. Karan, stop him..

648
00:52:57,673 --> 00:53:02,173
Thrash the bastard!
Thrash the bastard! Thrash the bastard!

649
00:53:02,673 --> 00:53:05,673
Sonia do something.

650
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:09,298
Hey hit him..
- Stop it..

651
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:16,131
Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it.
 Stop it before I say..

652
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:18,256
Aslam, do something

653
00:53:18,756 --> 00:53:26,673
Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it..
Stop it before I say.

654
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:34,465
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I took you guys in my film.

655
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,048
God knows what made me come here..

656
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,090
I was so stupid to pack my bags
and come to a place..

657
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:46,006
..where people are just looking
for an excuse to kill each other.

658
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:50,006
Well atleast now you all
will have one less excuse.

659
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:39,131
Sue!

660
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:54,131
Sue! Sue, we are sorry.

661
00:54:54,631 --> 00:54:57,256
You know we've got a problem with Pandey.
There's a lot of bad blood.

662
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:02,881
And if I stay, it's sure to happen again.
- No, Sue. I am saying it.

663
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:04,256
We've worked it out.

664
00:55:04,756 --> 00:55:08,256
You won't have any problems.

665
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:19,590
Sue.. we all know how much
this film means to you.

666
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:25,131
We want to help you finish
what you came here to do.

667
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:27,256
Everyone wants you to stay.

668
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:31,256
I want you to stay.

669
00:55:33,756 --> 00:55:36,881
Say something..

670
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:40,965
I am scared.

671
00:55:41,465 --> 00:55:46,465
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

672
00:55:46,965 --> 00:55:50,465
Come on.. Get up. ..Come here.

673
00:56:03,298 --> 00:56:04,923
"If a girl smiles it means
that she is allured.."

674
00:56:05,423 --> 00:56:08,965
Hey brother she will stay back.
She's not going anywhere.

675
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:12,798
You are a good actor.
Now, clean the room.

676
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:16,215
Now just chill. Look at this.

677
00:56:16,715 --> 00:56:20,840
The next four weeks were
the hardest of my entire life.

678
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,840
And the happiest.

679
00:56:26,923 --> 00:56:30,548
God is one. Truth is His name

680
00:56:31,048 --> 00:56:32,923
He is the Creator

681
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,798
The Fearless. Without Enmity.

682
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:39,256
The Immortal

683
00:56:39,756 --> 00:56:43,423
The Unborn, Self-illuminated

684
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:45,840
By the grace of the Guru

685
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,423
Recite

686
00:56:47,923 --> 00:56:49,090
True in the beginning

687
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:50,881
True before Time

688
00:56:51,381 --> 00:56:52,548
True in the present

689
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:58,090
Guru Nanak will be forever true

690
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,256
Thought cannot create Him

691
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:04,465
Even though one may try

692
00:57:04,965 --> 00:57:07,506
He cannot be attained through silence

693
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:10,881
Even though meditation is unbroken

694
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:16,215
The devout's hunger for God
can never be satisfied

695
00:57:16,715 --> 00:57:19,673
Despite the many worldly riches
you may have

696
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:26,381
Use the riches as you will.
But none will help you to attain God

697
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:31,590
How shall a man justify himself?

698
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,215
How can the screen of falsehood be torn?

699
00:57:35,715 --> 00:57:44,756
Nanak, by abiding the will of God
as ordained by Him

700
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:48,756
The Pure belong to God.
And Victory is God's alone

701
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:18,048
"Take some soil of my land.."

702
00:58:18,548 --> 00:58:27,340
"Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.."

703
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,965
"Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.."

704
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:37,923
"And the zeal,
that races through my blood.."

705
00:58:38,423 --> 00:58:42,548
"Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour"

706
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:47,131
"Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour"

707
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:49,840
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism,
my friend."

708
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,798
"Watch as it brings out the colour." ..

709
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:56,340
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

710
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,590
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

711
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,923
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

712
00:59:01,423 --> 00:59:03,131
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

713
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:05,465
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

714
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:07,756
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

715
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:10,090
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

716
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,298
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

717
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:14,298
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

718
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:16,423
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

719
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:20,881
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

720
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,506
Bismil's sent a message..

721
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:24,798
..that the Lucknow train..

722
00:59:25,298 --> 00:59:28,423
..carrying the Empire's money..
will be looted by us in Kakori..

723
00:59:28,923 --> 00:59:31,006
..while eating Kakori kababs.

724
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:34,506
And we will buy bombs with that money.
What will we buy? Bombs.

725
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:37,465
Leave her alone..
She will stop giving milk.

726
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:42,006
"Give colour to your dreams.
And those of your people."

727
00:59:42,506 --> 00:59:46,590
"Give colour to your happiness.
And your sadness too."

728
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:51,006
"Give colour to generations..
Give colour to the field.."

729
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:53,506
"Give colour to the beat of your heart.
And that of your music."

730
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:55,923
"Give colour to every cheek.
Give colour to your eyes.."

731
00:59:56,423 --> 00:59:58,465
"Watch as it brings out the colour
of patriotism my friend.."

732
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:01,090
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

733
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:10,298
"Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.."

734
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,798
"Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart."

735
01:00:15,298 --> 01:00:20,923
"And the zeal,
that races through my blood.."

736
01:00:21,423 --> 01:00:25,590
"Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour"

737
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,173
"Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour"

738
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:32,798
"Watch as it brings out the colour
of patriotism, my friend.."

739
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:35,048
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

740
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:41,048
Bismil's message and the Train going to Lucknow.
Hey Chotu!

741
01:00:41,548 --> 01:00:42,423
Did you get Bismil's message?

742
01:00:42,923 --> 01:00:44,215
No. - No!
Then Listen..

743
01:00:44,715 --> 01:00:46,006
The train that is leaving after eight days..

744
01:00:46,506 --> 01:00:47,965
.. we will loot it in Kakori..

745
01:00:48,465 --> 01:00:50,090
It's loaded with the Empire's money.

746
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,506
Will you loot it?
- No.

747
01:00:52,006 --> 01:00:54,340
Oye.. we will be buying arms from it.

748
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,673
What will we buy?
- Arms..

749
01:00:56,173 --> 01:00:57,298
Yes.. Very Good.. go now.

750
01:00:57,798 --> 01:01:02,048
"On a slow fire, won't you,
put this passion to cook.."

751
01:01:02,548 --> 01:01:06,798
"Then as it simmers, add a babbling brook.."
- Let's rock!

752
01:01:07,298 --> 01:01:11,215
"Add a river, and an ocean.
Maybe a pot of water.."

753
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:13,673
"Then sprinkle a bit. Stir it all up."

754
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:16,048
"And watch as it brings out the colour.."

755
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:22,340
"Watch as it brings out the colour
of patriotism, my friend.."

756
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,715
Bismil has sent a message..

757
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,465
..the Lucknow train..

758
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:28,465
..which carries the Empire's money..

759
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:31,965
..will be looted by us
in seven days, in Kakori..

760
01:01:32,465 --> 01:01:34,173
And we will buy bombs with that money.

761
01:01:34,673 --> 01:01:38,756
"Now paint the whole town with it.
Paint your very being."

762
01:01:39,256 --> 01:01:43,381
"Paint your every vein with it.
Paint it with a smile.."

763
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:45,631
"Paint those childhood years, won't you.

764
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:47,881
Paint the flush of youth.."

765
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:52,548
"Don't hesitate, my friend.
Paint your patriotism over everything.."

766
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:57,631
"Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend.."

767
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:02,173
"Take some soil of my land.."

768
01:02:02,673 --> 01:02:11,548
"Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.."

769
01:02:12,048 --> 01:02:16,090
"Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.."

770
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:22,131
"And the zeal,
that races through my blood.."

771
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:26,840
"Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour"

772
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:33,631
"Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend."

773
01:02:34,131 --> 01:02:36,006
"Watch as it brings out the colour."

774
01:02:36,506 --> 01:02:38,256
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

775
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:40,131
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

776
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:44,715
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

777
01:02:45,215 --> 01:02:51,465
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

778
01:02:51,965 --> 01:02:56,173
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

779
01:02:56,673 --> 01:03:00,173
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

780
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:10,256
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

781
01:03:10,756 --> 01:03:15,173
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

782
01:03:15,673 --> 01:03:20,506
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

783
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:29,206
"Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend."

784
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:39,129
The Kakori robbery on August 9th 1925
that's where it all started.

785
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:43,129
Nothing would ever be the same after that.

786
01:03:59,588 --> 01:04:01,546
British Officers.. around 20 to 25 of them.

787
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,546
We have to call it off!
We've nearly reached Kakori.

788
01:04:04,046 --> 01:04:07,546
Stop Ashfaq, quick.

789
01:04:14,296 --> 01:04:16,754
Ashfaq, stop!

790
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:20,754
It's too late to back out now..
Come on.. Move!

791
01:04:37,296 --> 01:04:40,796
Get inside!

792
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:54,213
Keep the windows shut..

793
01:04:54,713 --> 01:04:56,421
..no Indian will be hurt..

794
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:58,338
Come on!

795
01:04:58,838 --> 01:05:01,046
The keys!
- You won't get away with this.

796
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:04,129
Give me the keys!
- I don't have it. I don't have it.

797
01:05:04,629 --> 01:05:08,129
Banwari get the sledge-hammer.

798
01:05:10,379 --> 01:05:13,879
I'll handle them. You go get the money..

799
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:32,129
Kakori had sent shock waves
throughout the establishment.

800
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:35,296
But we had none to blame but ourselves.

801
01:05:35,796 --> 01:05:39,796
What we were hearing were
the echoes of our own guns.

802
01:05:50,588 --> 01:05:55,047
Fire..

803
01:05:55,947 --> 01:05:58,655
Reload.

804
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:02,655
Fire..

805
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:11,155
Reload

806
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:16,863
Fire..

807
01:07:19,927 --> 01:07:23,177
Jallianwala Baug meeting
essentially nonviolent people..

808
01:07:23,677 --> 01:07:25,052
..considered taking up arms.

809
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:28,677
This was when Bhagat Singh
stepped out of the shadows..

810
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:31,052
..to claim his destiny.

811
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:35,177
I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

812
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:40,360
Comfort and other worldly desires
do not attract me.

813
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:48,404
I know you want me to get married and
settle down..

814
01:07:49,004 --> 01:07:50,862
..like all parents do.

815
01:07:50,962 --> 01:07:53,579
But freedom is my bride.

816
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:56,987
I hope you'll forgive me.
Your most obedient son..

817
01:07:56,987 --> 01:07:59,537
Bhagat Singh.

818
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:01,729
Cut.

819
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,187
Let's take a break.

820
01:08:09,687 --> 01:08:13,187
Breakfast?
No..

821
01:08:32,753 --> 01:08:33,678
Put it there.

822
01:08:33,978 --> 01:08:41,437
General Dyer?
How can one even think of doing something like this?

823
01:08:42,342 --> 01:08:44,342
I can't believe
that he actually killed more..

824
01:08:44,842 --> 01:08:46,425
.. than 400 people at Jallianwala Baugh.

825
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:49,592
379.. that was the official figure.

826
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:52,342
Actually nearly 1000 people were butchered..

827
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:56,342
Here.

828
01:09:00,008 --> 01:09:05,550
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai,
I prayed for Daljeet's well being.

829
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,175
Who's Daljeet?

830
01:09:07,675 --> 01:09:10,550
We were the epitome of tolerance.

831
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,592
Even an ant reacts.
But we are conditioned ..

832
01:09:14,092 --> 01:09:16,008
..to take everything lying down.

833
01:09:16,508 --> 01:09:17,717
Rubbish! It's today's generation

834
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:19,175
.. which lacks the will to do anything

835
01:09:19,675 --> 01:09:21,050
Have you ever heard
of Shaheed Uddham Singh?

836
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:25,425
He went all the way to London
and killed that Dyer.

837
01:09:25,925 --> 01:09:28,717
..because he was also
a part of the Jallianwala Baugh massacre.

838
01:09:29,217 --> 01:09:32,800
Eat it Sonia.
The butter will strengthen your bones.

839
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,008
In Punjab every mother sends
at least one son to the army.

840
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,342
Why should we retreat?
Sacrifice runs in our blood.

841
01:09:40,842 --> 01:09:42,925
Only idiots like DJ retreat.

842
01:09:43,425 --> 01:09:44,967
Why does it always come back to me?

843
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:48,092
Shut up and eat your paratha.
Gollu, bring the lassi.

844
01:09:48,592 --> 01:09:51,133
We are taught from our childhood
to adjust our self.

845
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,300
Six people sitting on a seat for four..

846
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:59,467
..someone will squeeze in
and say Please adjust!

847
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:04,217
Hey! Why are you adjusting?
Come sit, sit.

848
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:09,350
Hey, brother, hey, brother.

849
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,758
Strange. Isn't it?

850
01:10:14,258 --> 01:10:20,092
We are being hunted like animals
in our own country..

851
01:10:22,592 --> 01:10:25,967
Ashfaq you should cross the border
and get to Afghanistan..

852
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:27,967
We have many Muslim friends there.

853
01:10:28,467 --> 01:10:29,967
You will be safe with them.

854
01:10:30,467 --> 01:10:32,258
After all you're one of their own.

855
01:10:32,758 --> 01:10:34,467
One of their own?
- Hmm..

856
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:38,467
Why am I not one of your own?

857
01:10:40,342 --> 01:10:43,258
Ashfaq.. I never meant..

858
01:10:43,758 --> 01:10:46,717
Ashfaq..

859
01:10:47,717 --> 01:10:50,883
I didn't mean to hurt you.

860
01:10:51,383 --> 01:10:54,383
This is your country as much as it is mine.

861
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:59,808
You have a right to fight
and die for it too..

862
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:04,050
Forgive me.
- Ram, let us not talk of dying..

863
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:08,050
I pray that we all live to see our children
live in a free country.

864
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:17,592
Ram run!

865
01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:18,133
Run.. Run..

866
01:12:30,508 --> 01:12:32,967
Where are your other friends?

867
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:36,967
Where's Azad?

868
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:43,925
Azad was not a man to be found easily.

869
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:49,592
A master of disguises appeared
and vanished at will.

870
01:12:50,092 --> 01:12:51,842
After months of frustration
a break through ..

871
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:54,233
.. came for the British Government.

872
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:59,175
Banwari Lal, 
weakest of the revolutionaries in captivity.

873
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:03,300
The man who had given us
the whereabouts of..

874
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,300
..Bismil and Ashfaqulla agreed
to be the bait to trap Azad.

875
01:13:23,783 --> 01:13:27,283
Banwari!

876
01:14:32,574 --> 01:14:37,324
Okay!
"Just make an eye to eye contact and learn.."

877
01:14:37,824 --> 01:14:39,283
I loved those songs and dances.

878
01:14:39,783 --> 01:14:41,574
That's the reason we make
films in this country.. to dance.

879
01:14:42,074 --> 01:14:45,241
Hey, you Hollywood's relative.

880
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:48,783
"Just make an eye contact.."

881
01:14:49,283 --> 01:14:51,324
So where are we going?
- Yes, where are we going?

882
01:14:51,824 --> 01:14:54,033
Hello! Where?

883
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:58,033
Special day, special place!
- Special Day?

884
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:12,574
It's amazing. 
 Isn't it?

885
01:16:13,074 --> 01:16:17,616
Ever since I was a kid I used to come here..

886
01:16:18,116 --> 01:16:20,824
..to watch planes take off.. and watch ..

887
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:24,824
.. them till they don't disappear in the sky.

888
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,741
These guys have gone crazy!

889
01:16:58,241 --> 01:17:00,158
Come on, face it,
you'd love to do that really.

890
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,574
What?
Take my shirt off and howl at planes.

891
01:17:03,074 --> 01:17:05,324
I won't mind if you do.

892
01:17:05,824 --> 01:17:09,324
Dream on buddy..

893
01:17:14,574 --> 01:17:16,699
Hey, Wild people.
- Boys and girls and ..

894
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,474
.. Sukhi who is always after girls..

895
01:17:19,074 --> 01:17:20,166
Why me all the time?

896
01:17:20,366 --> 01:17:23,283
I want to make a special announcement..

897
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:28,033
Ma'am, I was wondering if you'd like to ..

898
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:32,033
.. spend the rest of your life with me..

899
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:40,074
Will you please marry me?

900
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:48,033
This is a real love.

901
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:52,033
"Ajay has done it.."
"Ajay has done it.."

902
01:18:28,441 --> 01:18:39,983
"Without saying a word,
you steal my heart."

903
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:48,324
"I'll find happiness by your..

904
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:57,366
..side I can't stay apart."

905
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:11,949
"My life tastes sweet now..

906
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:19,366
..since you walked..

907
01:19:19,866 --> 01:19:28,408
.. through that door."

908
01:19:28,908 --> 01:19:36,283
"When your arms wrap around me..

909
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:45,366
..I know I've found my shore."

910
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:52,283
"Without saying a word..

911
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:56,283
..you steal my heart."

912
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:34,933
"Sweep through the streets of..

913
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:41,833
..my mind Like a gentle spring."

914
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:51,449
"Walk through the corridors of my heart..

915
01:20:51,949 --> 01:20:55,333
..fill the caravan of my dreams."

916
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:05,966
"I sway to the song..

917
01:21:07,866 --> 01:21:11,458
..of your soul."

918
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:23,308
"Without saying a word..

919
01:21:24,408 --> 01:21:30,974
..you steal my heart."

920
01:21:32,574 --> 01:21:39,824
"I'll find happiness by your side..

921
01:21:40,324 --> 01:21:43,824
..I can't stay apart."

922
01:21:54,236 --> 01:22:00,569
The first thing that hit me
about this man was his voice.

923
01:22:01,569 --> 01:22:05,069
I knew then my job
was not going to be easy.

924
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:07,069
I'll come back later.

925
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:14,361
My prayers won't stop
till my country gets its freedom.

926
01:22:14,861 --> 01:22:18,319
I don't think you can wait till then.

927
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:24,361
My name is James McKinley.
I'm here to find out from you..

928
01:22:24,861 --> 01:22:28,194
..where Azad and
the other terrorists are hiding.

929
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:32,194
Not terrorists. Revolutionaries.
Call them Revolutionaries.

930
01:22:47,278 --> 01:22:55,236
Breaking a man bit by bit,
they said it would get easier by time.

931
01:22:55,736 --> 01:22:59,236
It never did.

932
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:36,861
The torture went on
for sometime but Bismil didn't break.

933
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:40,861
Also Ashfaq.

934
01:23:42,694 --> 01:23:48,069
Both men had made pain their friend,
they didn't break.

935
01:23:48,569 --> 01:23:51,111
Instead they did something that I had never ..

936
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:55,111
.. seen any prisoner do before.

937
01:24:09,403 --> 01:24:13,528
Death cannot take you Ashfaq..

938
01:24:14,028 --> 01:24:19,778
.. live in people's hearts and minds.

939
01:24:20,278 --> 01:24:23,069
..as the torture tore their bodies apart.

940
01:24:23,569 --> 01:24:28,153
I think it was the poetry that held
their souls together..

941
01:24:28,353 --> 01:24:32,311
The torture didn't work
so we thought of other ways.

942
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:36,903
This is the Holy Quran.

943
01:24:37,403 --> 01:24:41,778
Hindus like Bismil will create
a country for themselves.

944
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:45,278
They're just using you.

945
01:24:45,778 --> 01:24:47,153
He's not fighting for Hindu freedom, ..

946
01:24:47,653 --> 01:24:50,444
.. he's fighting for Hindustan's freedom.

947
01:24:50,944 --> 01:24:54,361
But you won't be able to understand this.

948
01:24:54,861 --> 01:24:58,361
You've been a slave so long you've begun to like it.

949
01:25:03,486 --> 01:25:08,569
Tell us where Azad and the other terrorists are..

950
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:12,569
..You can still save yourself.

951
01:25:19,778 --> 01:25:21,111
19 December.

952
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:24,486
It's not your fault, Mr. McKinley..

953
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:27,444
..you're only doing your duty.

954
01:25:27,944 --> 01:25:32,069
How can I stay loyal?

955
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:36,486
Tell me..

956
01:25:36,986 --> 01:25:41,111
Tell me!

957
01:25:41,611 --> 01:25:45,111
How can this be the will of God?

958
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:01,153
Things have become harder for me.

959
01:26:03,861 --> 01:26:07,361
I have not been made to kill these people.

960
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:24,486
Hey, hey guys what's up?

961
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:31,236
What's wrong? Did someone die?

962
01:27:31,736 --> 01:27:36,069
Sue.. I haven't seen these guys so serious.

963
01:27:36,569 --> 01:27:38,569
What are you doing to my friends?

964
01:27:39,069 --> 01:27:44,361
It's not me.. it's them.
They've really begun to get into this.

965
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:47,069
Hey Laxman, aren't you coming along?

966
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:48,694
No. Some other time.

967
01:27:49,194 --> 01:27:51,111
Come on. It's my last night in town.

968
01:27:51,611 --> 01:27:52,944
I'm not really hungry.

969
01:27:53,444 --> 01:27:58,028
Watch us eat then.
Come on.

970
01:27:58,528 --> 01:28:02,028
Come on.

971
01:28:12,944 --> 01:28:16,403
To two lovebirds..
may they always be happy.

972
01:28:16,903 --> 01:28:23,319
May the insanity and romance never die.
Cheers.

973
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:27,778
I said cheers guys.
- Cheers. Cheers.. Cheers..

974
01:28:28,278 --> 01:28:30,153
I'm insane only about two things in my life.

975
01:28:30,653 --> 01:28:33,569
Sonia and flying.

976
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:41,319
"What is my heart, take also my life.."

977
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:46,653
You're lucky to feel
so passionately about something.

978
01:28:47,153 --> 01:28:49,153
You have your poetry Aslam.

979
01:28:49,653 --> 01:28:51,903
Just like DJ has his singing.

980
01:28:52,403 --> 01:28:53,069
Everyone has passion for something inside ..

981
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:54,444
.. them, they just have
to find this 'thing'.

982
01:28:54,944 --> 01:28:56,778
Just like our revolutionaries..

983
01:28:57,278 --> 01:28:58,486
..their passion for freedom was greater than ..

984
01:28:58,986 --> 01:29:00,361
.. their love for their own lives.

985
01:29:00,861 --> 01:29:05,611
There's nothing in this world worth
giving your life for. Nothing!

986
01:29:06,111 --> 01:29:08,486
Correct, except Umrao Jaan.

987
01:29:08,986 --> 01:29:11,986
Just once..
- Repeat.

988
01:29:12,486 --> 01:29:13,444
Easy DJ..

989
01:29:13,944 --> 01:29:15,486
Yes mama.

990
01:29:15,986 --> 01:29:19,028
Come on Karan,
there are things worth giving your life for Karan.

991
01:29:19,528 --> 01:29:20,653
Please.

992
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:22,319
Like what? Look at Bhagat Singh and Azad ..

993
01:29:22,819 --> 01:29:23,861
.. and the rest of those guys.

994
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:25,819
They gave their lives for this country.

995
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,153
Look what happened. All for nothing.

996
01:29:29,653 --> 01:29:34,819
It's a shit-hole today.
Does any one care about them?

997
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:36,319
I give a shit.

998
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:40,319
People like Ajay who fight
for their country give a shit.

999
01:29:40,819 --> 01:29:42,694
So that people like you
can sleep peacefully.

1000
01:29:43,194 --> 01:29:47,194
Give life.
- Sonia get real.

1001
01:29:47,694 --> 01:29:48,778
Sonia's right.

1002
01:29:49,278 --> 01:29:52,778
Sue, it's all-fine
for a foreigner like you to say all this..

1003
01:29:53,278 --> 01:29:57,528
Out here we're fighting for basics..

1004
01:29:58,028 --> 01:29:59,403
..food, clothing and shelter.

1005
01:29:59,903 --> 01:30:03,611
Out here you try to change things
you'll get even more screwed..

1006
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:07,369
..corruption is in our DNA.

1007
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,403
There is no future for this country.

1008
01:30:09,903 --> 01:30:14,028
She's talking about the past,
you're thinking about the future..

1009
01:30:14,528 --> 01:30:16,611
One leg in the past
and one leg in the future..

1010
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,986
..that's why we're pissing on the present..

1011
01:30:19,486 --> 01:30:22,986
DJ just shut up.
For once in life get serious.

1012
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:32,903
Karan, it's easy to sit
on the outside and be a critic..

1013
01:30:33,403 --> 01:30:36,778
..blaming others is even easier.

1014
01:30:37,278 --> 01:30:38,694
If you have so many problems then why ..

1015
01:30:39,194 --> 01:30:40,278
.. don't you go out there and change things?

1016
01:30:40,778 --> 01:30:42,403
This is your country too.

1017
01:30:42,903 --> 01:30:47,528
Join politics, the police force,
government and clean it up.

1018
01:30:48,028 --> 01:30:51,319
But you won't! I'll tell you why..

1019
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:58,028
Because that takes hard work.
It's easier to crib.

1020
01:30:58,528 --> 01:31:01,528
If you have dare then try yourself
to change this country.

1021
01:31:02,028 --> 01:31:03,403
Nothing's going to change.

1022
01:31:03,903 --> 01:31:07,653
You can go to your grave trying..
it won't make any difference.

1023
01:31:08,153 --> 01:31:12,861
Correct..
the only difference will be how you go to your grave..

1024
01:31:13,361 --> 01:31:16,903
DJ Releax.
- I am relaxed.

1025
01:31:17,403 --> 01:31:24,569
I'm not drunk. Am I drunk Sue?
- No.

1026
01:31:25,069 --> 01:31:31,403
See, the director's word is final.
Cut it!

1027
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,736
Where were we?

1028
01:31:35,236 --> 01:31:36,403
On the way to our graves.

1029
01:31:36,903 --> 01:31:43,736
Yes, we all will be carried
in the same style to our graves.

1030
01:31:44,236 --> 01:31:48,153
We'll all be wrapped
in white shrouds when we die.

1031
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:53,069
Only Ajay will be wrapped in the national flag.
- DJ stop it.

1032
01:31:53,569 --> 01:31:56,944
Karan, you can say whatever you want,

1033
01:31:57,444 --> 01:32:01,694
Not even the street dogs will bark
when we die.

1034
01:32:02,194 --> 01:32:05,694
But Ajay will get a 21 gun salute.

1035
01:32:15,653 --> 01:32:22,528
Left, Right. Left, Right. Left, Right..

1036
01:32:23,028 --> 01:32:27,111
What are you doing?
- Attention! - Attention!

1037
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:31,111
Move forward!
- Move forward.

1038
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:48,278
Karan, this is for you.

1039
01:32:48,778 --> 01:32:50,236
For me? Thanks dude.

1040
01:32:50,736 --> 01:32:52,486
The girls fall for him anyway..

1041
01:32:52,986 --> 01:32:54,153
If anyone deserves the jacket, it's me.

1042
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:57,569
Wow! What a dutiful daughter-in-law.

1043
01:32:58,069 --> 01:33:01,694
Now you see, she will touch her f fianc's feet.

1044
01:33:02,194 --> 01:33:05,736
DJ's right.
Touch my feet, madam.

1045
01:33:06,236 --> 01:33:07,861
Come on.
- Stupid.

1046
01:33:08,361 --> 01:33:12,028
See what women in this country
have to put up with?

1047
01:33:12,528 --> 01:33:16,236
I think DJ's right.
You should respect your traditions.

1048
01:33:16,736 --> 01:33:17,861
See, even Sue agrees..

1049
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:19,778
.. a woman's place is at her husband's feet.

1050
01:33:20,278 --> 01:33:23,861
Honey, you should know it.
- I see.

1051
01:33:24,361 --> 01:33:29,694
Mother.. Mother..

1052
01:33:30,194 --> 01:33:31,611
These two can be such children.

1053
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:35,444
They spend half their time fighting.
The other half making up.

1054
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,903
Sweetie-pie, can't you stay a while longer?

1055
01:33:39,403 --> 01:33:42,361
No, I have to go..

1056
01:33:42,861 --> 01:33:48,694
Sweetie - Pie! Sweetie - Pie!
- Shut up guys.

1057
01:33:49,194 --> 01:33:53,444
"Don't go dear leaving me behind..

1058
01:33:53,944 --> 01:33:58,444
..I swear I will cry.. "
- Shut up yaar..

1059
01:33:58,944 --> 01:34:01,528
I know how Sonia must be feeling right now..

1060
01:34:02,028 --> 01:34:03,653
.. my father was also in the army.

1061
01:34:04,153 --> 01:34:06,694
I used to think that way too..

1062
01:34:07,194 --> 01:34:09,903
when Ajay's father and I first got married
an Air-force pilot's wife.

1063
01:34:10,403 --> 01:34:13,403
You realize that..

1064
01:34:13,903 --> 01:34:19,778
..your husband has pledged his life for the country.

1065
01:34:20,278 --> 01:34:23,778
Whether you like it or not you have to accept it.

1066
01:34:33,903 --> 01:34:39,236
I'm so happy Ajay's chosen a girl like you..

1067
01:34:39,736 --> 01:34:42,153
.. now I can die in peace.
- Don't talk nonsense Ma.

1068
01:34:42,653 --> 01:34:46,861
You'll have many more years..
and a dozen grandchildren too.

1069
01:34:47,361 --> 01:34:48,736
Grandchildren?
First you've got to stay home..

1070
01:34:49,236 --> 01:34:52,736
.. long enough to make them, dude.

1071
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:26,394
"The bugle sounds, the enemy wakes.
The battle is upon us.. "

1072
01:35:27,694 --> 01:35:30,778
"And in our hearts, we feel the swell, of..

1073
01:35:31,278 --> 01:35:34,569
.. pride and steel and valour.. "

1074
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:37,236
"For we will play the game of blood, if..

1075
01:35:37,736 --> 01:35:41,819
.. dark clouds shroud our land.. "

1076
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:44,944
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1077
01:35:45,444 --> 01:35:48,069
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1078
01:35:48,569 --> 01:35:50,611
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1079
01:35:51,111 --> 01:35:53,028
.. our courage is far sharper.. "

1080
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:59,278
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1081
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:06,119
.. our courage is far sharper.. "

1082
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:15,069
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1083
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:22,444
"For let them know, their cowardly deeds..

1084
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:27,403
.. , just serve to stoke our fires.. "

1085
01:36:27,903 --> 01:36:32,444
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1086
01:36:32,944 --> 01:36:38,528
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1087
01:36:39,028 --> 01:36:43,403
"We bade farewell, to this day,
knowing it could be our last.. "

1088
01:36:43,903 --> 01:36:48,236
"We swore to play, with our lives,
never waver in our task.. "

1089
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:50,819
"For we are but the last, few guests..

1090
01:36:51,319 --> 01:36:53,194
.. served at fate's great banquet.. "

1091
01:36:53,694 --> 01:36:55,653
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1092
01:36:56,153 --> 01:36:58,028
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1093
01:36:58,528 --> 01:37:00,611
"We cannot quell, the raging storm,
the spirit of revolution.. "

1094
01:37:01,111 --> 01:37:03,069
"For it now courses in our veins,
like lava truly molten.. "

1095
01:37:03,569 --> 01:37:08,069
"We will teach them, the twin lessons,
of fear and fortitude.. "

1096
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:10,486
"Our goal cannot now hide for long..

1097
01:37:10,986 --> 01:37:12,819
.. when courage is our beacon."

1098
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:15,319
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1099
01:37:15,819 --> 01:37:18,861
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1100
01:37:19,361 --> 01:37:21,778
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1101
01:37:22,278 --> 01:37:23,569
The entire country is in
the deep state of mourning..

1102
01:37:24,069 --> 01:37:25,861
.. because of the demise of Lala Lajpat Rai.

1103
01:37:26,361 --> 01:37:28,861
Just before dying he said,
"Every blow rendered on me is the..

1104
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:36,736
.. is the nail imbedded in the coffin
of the British imperialism.

1105
01:37:37,236 --> 01:37:41,219
It was the calm before the storm.

1106
01:37:42,324 --> 01:37:45,366
We have to take drastic measures.

1107
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:49,199
What drastic measures?

1108
01:37:49,699 --> 01:37:53,199
Kill him.

1109
01:38:13,991 --> 01:38:17,491
C'mon..

1110
01:38:41,741 --> 01:38:45,991
Bhagat run!
Quick!

1111
01:38:46,491 --> 01:38:49,991
Hey go away from here.
We don't want to kill any Hindustani.

1112
01:39:07,824 --> 01:39:11,074
And the days that followed Azad,
Bhagat Singh..

1113
01:39:12,074 --> 01:39:13,366
and the others went missing.

1114
01:39:13,866 --> 01:39:16,283
This was the period when they coined two words..

1115
01:39:16,783 --> 01:39:20,158
.. 'Inquilab Zindabad'

1116
01:39:20,658 --> 01:39:21,908
Inquilab Zindabad
- "Long live the revolution".

1117
01:39:22,408 --> 01:39:24,074
Two words that became the slogan for..

1118
01:39:24,574 --> 01:39:28,074
.. the Indian freedom movement.

1119
01:39:32,116 --> 01:39:33,741
Great idea!

1120
01:39:34,241 --> 01:39:35,991
But Bhagat, escaping will be impossible.

1121
01:39:36,491 --> 01:39:40,574
Our main mission is to get caught..
not escape.

1122
01:39:41,074 --> 01:39:42,033
What?

1123
01:39:42,533 --> 01:39:43,824
If we get caught there will be a trial..

1124
01:39:44,324 --> 01:39:48,408
.. we'll get a chance to speak.

1125
01:39:48,908 --> 01:39:52,408
We'll be heard.

1126
01:39:56,533 --> 01:40:00,158
But if they catch us, they'll hang us for certain.

1127
01:40:00,658 --> 01:40:03,324
I know.

1128
01:40:03,824 --> 01:40:07,324
But it takes a loud noise to open deaf ears.

1129
01:40:14,283 --> 01:40:15,699
Long live the revolution!

1130
01:40:16,199 --> 01:40:18,158
They were only smoke bombs, intended to..

1131
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:21,199
.. awaken England from her dreams.

1132
01:40:21,699 --> 01:40:25,199
And they had more than achieved their task.

1133
01:40:35,408 --> 01:40:44,658
"Feel the unrest sweep through the land.. "

1134
01:40:45,158 --> 01:40:54,741
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest."

1135
01:40:55,241 --> 01:41:04,533
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest."

1136
01:41:05,033 --> 01:41:07,033
"The embers, they are burning.. "

1137
01:41:07,533 --> 01:41:09,533
"The tide, it's turning.
You can feel the winds of change.. "

1138
01:41:10,033 --> 01:41:13,533
"Feel the unrest sweep through the land
Feel the unrest.. "

1139
01:41:25,449 --> 01:41:28,033
We are prisoners.. political prisoners..

1140
01:41:28,533 --> 01:41:31,408
.. we should be allowed books..
writing material..

1141
01:41:31,908 --> 01:41:34,699
.. and at least one daily newspaper.

1142
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:38,699
We will not eat till then.
The hunger strike will continue.

1143
01:41:50,858 --> 01:41:56,624
The fast and the torture went on for 114 days.
114 days!

1144
01:41:58,824 --> 01:42:01,258
Never before in the history of any revolution..

1145
01:42:01,158 --> 01:42:02,366
.. had anyone lasted so long.

1146
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:08,283
In such inhumane conditions we could
crush these young boys..

1147
01:42:09,283 --> 01:42:11,324
.. but we could not crush their souls.

1148
01:42:11,824 --> 01:42:18,241
"Our words won't falter now,
We will speak our mind.. "

1149
01:42:18,741 --> 01:42:24,158
"We won't back down now.
Our dreams we won't leave behind.. "

1150
01:42:24,658 --> 01:42:28,158
"We won't let the storm die.
Injustice we will defy.. "

1151
01:42:41,324 --> 01:42:45,783
"You can feel it possess you now.
Feel it, your soul claim.. "

1152
01:42:46,283 --> 01:42:50,741
"You can feel it possess you now.
Feel it, your soul claim.. "

1153
01:42:51,241 --> 01:42:53,283
"Drink this spirit in one long swallow.

1154
01:42:53,783 --> 01:42:55,699
Feel it course through your veins.. "

1155
01:42:56,199 --> 01:43:00,616
"Let the celebrations begin now.
Feel your body sway.. "

1156
01:43:01,116 --> 01:43:05,866
"In every breath feel more alive.
To keep the storm at bay.. "

1157
01:43:06,366 --> 01:43:08,491
"See the unrest in those eyes.
See it all around.. "

1158
01:43:08,991 --> 01:43:15,991
"See it in the air, my friend.
And in those hearts, abound.. "

1159
01:43:16,491 --> 01:43:18,574
"See the unrest in those eyes.
See it all around.. "

1160
01:43:19,074 --> 01:43:22,574
"See it in the air, my friend.
And in those hearts, abound.. "

1161
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:43,033
"We are engulfed in the shadows.
But we will come out brighter.. "

1162
01:43:43,533 --> 01:43:45,658
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1163
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:52,908
"We are engulfed in the shadows
But we will come out brighter.. "

1164
01:43:53,408 --> 01:43:55,616
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1165
01:43:56,116 --> 01:44:04,033
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1166
01:44:06,533 --> 01:44:10,033
"Injustice we will defy.. "

1167
01:44:13,491 --> 01:44:16,074
Pretty nice huh?
Very pretty.

1168
01:44:16,574 --> 01:44:20,074
I like these ones, I think I'll buy them.

1169
01:44:23,949 --> 01:44:26,908
This is not an animal.

1170
01:44:27,408 --> 01:44:30,074
In breaking news today..

1171
01:44:30,574 --> 01:44:34,658
.. a MIG-21 fighter plane has just crashed..

1172
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:37,866
.. this is the second such crash
in the past six months..

1173
01:44:38,366 --> 01:44:41,783
The Defence Ministry has ordered
an investigation into the crash.

1174
01:44:42,283 --> 01:44:45,324
We have just received news that the pilot..

1175
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:50,408
.. Flight Lieutenant Ajay Rathod
has died in the crash.

1176
01:44:50,908 --> 01:44:54,074
Flight Lt Rathod apparently did not eject
from the burning plane..

1177
01:44:54,574 --> 01:44:58,324
Instead he steered it
and crashed it in an open field.

1178
01:44:58,824 --> 01:45:02,366
Thus saving many lives

1179
01:45:02,866 --> 01:45:04,949
Viewers may recall..

1180
01:45:05,449 --> 01:45:08,616
.. that until now,
163 MiG-21 of IAF have crashed..

1181
01:45:09,116 --> 01:45:12,616
.. and 66 pilots have lost their lives.

1182
01:46:28,491 --> 01:46:32,449
"This game of hide and seek
has gone on too long..

1183
01:46:32,949 --> 01:46:37,241
.. come home now, won't you."

1184
01:46:37,741 --> 01:46:41,741
"I've searched high and low."

1185
01:46:42,241 --> 01:46:48,241
"These old eyes are weary so,
come home now won't you.. "

1186
01:46:48,741 --> 01:46:52,741
"Dusk is spreading like
the ache in my heart..

1187
01:46:53,241 --> 01:47:00,866
.. my vision blurs,
come home now won't you."

1188
01:47:01,366 --> 01:47:08,991
"I'm in a place you wouldn't believe Ma."

1189
01:47:10,491 --> 01:47:16,783
"Endless skies I can soar."

1190
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:23,824
"Just like your fairy tales,
it's filled with dreams."

1191
01:47:24,324 --> 01:47:28,116
"A sea of hope with no shore."

1192
01:47:28,616 --> 01:47:34,116
"My soul flies here,
like a kite without fear.

1193
01:47:37,616 --> 01:47:45,491
No one to cut my strings, no more."

1194
01:47:45,991 --> 01:47:51,199
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod stayed
in the plane until the very end..

1195
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:55,824
.. and steered the plane clear
of Ambala city.

1196
01:47:56,324 --> 01:48:03,116
Thereby saving many lives.
But Lt. Rathod

1197
01:48:03,616 --> 01:48:05,408
.. had to give away his life.

1198
01:48:05,908 --> 01:48:07,449
In the last 10 years over 100 MIG-21..

1199
01:48:07,949 --> 01:48:09,483
.. aircrafts of the IAF have crashed..

1200
01:48:09,783 --> 01:48:13,741
.. in which over 30 pilots
have lost their lives.

1201
01:48:14,241 --> 01:48:16,033
Defence Minister Shastri, the CAG report..

1202
01:48:16,533 --> 01:48:17,949
.. states that old and defective..

1203
01:48:17,949 --> 01:48:21,366
.. Russian spare parts were procured
by the government.

1204
01:48:21,866 --> 01:48:24,908
Isn't this a case of high-level corruption?

1205
01:48:25,408 --> 01:48:27,283
Not at all.
I've personally clarified..

1206
01:48:27,783 --> 01:48:30,866
.. the issue in the parliament.

1207
01:48:31,366 --> 01:48:32,908
This is a downright lie.

1208
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,824
The youngsters of today are brash and..

1209
01:48:35,324 --> 01:48:36,358
.. irresponsible when it comes to flying planes.

1210
01:48:36,658 --> 01:48:38,533
No! I don't agree..

1211
01:48:39,033 --> 01:48:41,158
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod was an ace pilot..

1212
01:48:41,658 --> 01:48:43,366
.. who I trained..

1213
01:48:43,866 --> 01:48:47,533
He was a gold medalist.
The youngest to clear night sorties.

1214
01:48:48,033 --> 01:48:50,533
With over 1000 flying hours..

1215
01:48:51,033 --> 01:48:53,491
This can't be the record of
an irresponsible pilot.

1216
01:48:53,991 --> 01:48:56,533
Defence Minister, how many more pilots..

1217
01:48:57,033 --> 01:48:59,574
.. will you send to their graves..

1218
01:49:00,074 --> 01:49:01,991
.. before you stop the rot in the system?

1219
01:49:02,491 --> 01:49:04,116
Will all our boys die the same way?

1220
01:49:04,616 --> 01:49:07,616
We are talking about the one..

1221
01:49:08,116 --> 01:49:16,699
"If only I could show you this place, Ma."

1222
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:25,991
"Here waterfalls are made of rainbows."

1223
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:30,616
"There are no roses just bouquets of dreams Ma."

1224
01:49:31,116 --> 01:49:35,116
"Their scent, no flower can hope for."

1225
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:39,908
"Here sunlight and shadow walk hand in hand."

1226
01:49:40,408 --> 01:49:44,491
"Everything seems bright and new."

1227
01:49:44,991 --> 01:49:49,116
"But what is heaven, and all its wonders,

1228
01:49:49,616 --> 01:49:54,699
.. when Ma, I don't have you."

1229
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:58,116
From now on, the government
will make sure that..

1230
01:49:58,616 --> 01:50:03,658
.. only experienced pilots are given
access to these machines..

1231
01:50:04,158 --> 01:50:10,199
.. and not to rash pilots like Ajay Rathod.

1232
01:50:10,699 --> 01:50:12,199
What the hell is he talking about!

1233
01:50:12,699 --> 01:50:16,199
I welcome any investigation.
I have nothing to hide.

1234
01:50:21,241 --> 01:50:25,408
This damn MIG investigation
shouldn't take us down.

1235
01:50:25,908 --> 01:50:32,908
Relax Sir. Public memory is short.
Besides, we'll handle things.

1236
01:50:33,408 --> 01:50:38,616
Dead pilots, live very long in the news.

1237
01:50:39,116 --> 01:50:42,616
But then, they join the forces
to sacrifice their lives. Don't they?

1238
01:51:50,608 --> 01:51:52,816
The situation is tense at the moment.

1239
01:51:53,616 --> 01:51:55,783
There is growing anger and discontent.

1240
01:51:56,283 --> 01:51:57,283
Directed largely towards the government..

1241
01:51:57,783 --> 01:52:00,158
.. especially the Defence Minister.

1242
01:52:00,658 --> 01:52:04,158
We have with us Ajay Rathod's mother..

1243
01:52:06,449 --> 01:52:09,241
The government can't wash
its hand off the issue like this.

1244
01:52:09,741 --> 01:52:12,324
They are answerable to the public.

1245
01:52:12,824 --> 01:52:15,199
If the MIG spare parts were of doubtful quality..

1246
01:52:15,699 --> 01:52:22,324
.. why were they bought in the first place?

1247
01:52:22,824 --> 01:52:26,533
MIG's can be made again..
But our children..

1248
01:52:27,033 --> 01:52:31,074
.. cannot be brought back..

1249
01:52:31,574 --> 01:52:35,991
It is very clear, the Defence
Minister is morally responsible.

1250
01:52:36,491 --> 01:52:37,908
He has to resign.

1251
01:52:38,408 --> 01:52:41,783
It looks like the veil has been pulled off
the Defence scam.

1252
01:52:42,283 --> 01:52:45,158
But how much will be revealed?

1253
01:52:45,658 --> 01:52:50,874
Mishra, what's happening?

1254
01:52:52,074 --> 01:52:55,574
Our Defence minister says
that Ajay Rathod was a novice but..

1255
01:53:05,741 --> 01:53:08,408
.. he didn't let his plane crash into the town.

1256
01:53:08,908 --> 01:53:15,074
When it developed a snag
he didn't try to save his life.

1257
01:53:16,574 --> 01:53:19,783
He didn't try to save his life.

1258
01:53:20,283 --> 01:53:26,283
He steered it clear of Ambala..
saving thousands of civilians.

1259
01:53:26,783 --> 01:53:33,324
Yet the Defence Minister calls him rash.

1260
01:53:33,824 --> 01:53:37,658
We want to ask a question
that how many of the minister's..

1261
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:41,658
.. children's are in army.

1262
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:56,408
I'm not moving.. this is for Ajay.

1263
01:53:56,908 --> 01:53:58,574
This could turn ugly Aunty.

1264
01:53:59,074 --> 01:54:02,574
Let it.

1265
01:54:24,574 --> 01:54:28,866
"Our blood is raging.
It's flowing through the streets."..

1266
01:54:29,366 --> 01:54:31,908
.. "But it won't go in vain"

1267
01:54:32,408 --> 01:54:39,991
"Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose.
A cause we will attain."

1268
01:54:40,491 --> 01:54:47,699
"It fell from our bodies,
embraced the earth."

1269
01:54:48,199 --> 01:54:52,991
"Went winding through streets.
A river of courage"

1270
01:54:53,491 --> 01:54:57,491
"It surged and swept."

1271
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:01,491
"It flowed to make a new beginning"
"Our blood raging.. "

1272
01:55:19,866 --> 01:55:27,533
"From gaping wounds, and gashes large,"

1273
01:55:28,033 --> 01:55:34,908
"It oozed, slowly and steadily."

1274
01:55:35,408 --> 01:55:43,116
"While the pointing fingers,
got fists in reply,"

1275
01:55:43,616 --> 01:55:52,533
"Yet, our blood was raging"

1276
01:55:53,033 --> 01:56:00,533
"It flowed not in vain but with a purpose."

1277
01:56:01,033 --> 01:56:08,574
"Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose."

1278
01:56:09,074 --> 01:56:16,324
"It fell from our bodies,
embraced the earth."

1279
01:56:16,824 --> 01:56:21,658
"Our blood is ranging.
It's flowing through the streets."

1280
01:56:22,158 --> 01:56:26,033
"It surged and swept."

1281
01:56:26,533 --> 01:56:30,908
"It flowed to make a new beginning"

1282
01:56:31,408 --> 01:56:36,491
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1283
01:56:36,991 --> 01:56:40,449
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1284
01:56:40,949 --> 01:56:44,366
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1285
01:56:44,866 --> 01:56:48,324
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1286
01:56:48,824 --> 01:56:52,283
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1287
01:56:52,783 --> 01:56:56,158
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1288
01:56:56,658 --> 01:57:00,158
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1289
01:57:16,408 --> 01:57:17,408
Someone get a doctor! Immediately!

1290
01:57:17,908 --> 01:57:18,824
Take her to emergency ward.
- Yes doctor.

1291
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:22,283
Fast.

1292
01:57:22,783 --> 01:57:26,283
Please stay here.
I'll take care of patient. Please.

1293
01:57:32,341 --> 01:57:35,841
Greetings!

1294
01:57:45,881 --> 01:57:49,839
They were beating up innocent people..

1295
01:57:50,339 --> 01:57:52,464
Why didn't you stop them?

1296
01:57:52,964 --> 01:57:54,673
You protested against the government,
our own party..

1297
01:57:55,173 --> 01:57:56,506
The protest was not against the party..

1298
01:57:57,006 --> 01:57:59,089
The protest was not against the party..

1299
01:57:59,589 --> 01:58:02,839
.. it was for the truth.

1300
01:58:03,339 --> 01:58:06,006
So many pilots have died..

1301
01:58:06,506 --> 01:58:08,089
.. young boys who were fighting
for our country.. killed..

1302
01:58:08,589 --> 01:58:13,881
.. so that someone in the government
could make money.

1303
01:58:14,381 --> 01:58:17,173
And our party office doesn't do
a thing about it.

1304
01:58:17,673 --> 01:58:21,173
Come.. Sit down.

1305
01:58:23,923 --> 01:58:26,923
Have some tea.

1306
01:58:31,381 --> 01:58:34,589
Don't be so emotional.

1307
01:58:35,089 --> 01:58:38,381
In politics there's no place for emotions.

1308
01:58:38,881 --> 01:58:41,631
We have big plans for you.

1309
01:58:42,131 --> 01:58:44,048
You have to go further.
- I don't want to go anywhere.

1310
01:58:44,548 --> 01:58:49,923
Only dogs salivate when you
show them bone Mishraji.

1311
01:58:50,423 --> 01:58:56,256
Beat him.. Beat him..

1312
01:58:56,756 --> 01:59:00,256
Beat him.. Beat him..

1313
01:59:20,339 --> 01:59:21,631
How's Aunty?

1314
01:59:22,131 --> 01:59:25,631
They're doing an MRI.
We are waiting.

1315
01:59:42,548 --> 01:59:44,839
I am sorry, she's slipped into a coma.

1316
01:59:45,339 --> 01:59:51,006
Severe skull damage,
coupled with the shock of her son's death.

1317
01:59:51,506 --> 01:59:55,339
That's an ugly gash.
You need attention.

1318
01:59:55,839 --> 01:59:57,131
Nothing will happen to mother.

1319
01:59:57,131 --> 01:59:59,756
If you need anything, I am there.

1320
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:03,756
Aslam.. How's he?

1321
02:00:06,964 --> 02:00:10,464
What have you come for?
Haven't you done enough damage?

1322
02:00:13,548 --> 02:00:16,298
Uncle, it isn't what you think.

1323
02:00:16,798 --> 02:00:22,798
I'm not interested in what you think
and what you want to do..

1324
02:00:23,298 --> 02:00:25,173
I'm just going to say this once.

1325
02:00:25,673 --> 02:00:28,173
Aslam doesn't know what
is good or bad for him.

1326
02:00:28,673 --> 02:00:29,381
He's an emotional boy, always has been.

1327
02:00:29,881 --> 02:00:32,756
He listens to his heart, not his head.

1328
02:00:33,256 --> 02:00:36,256
These are bad times, for people like us.

1329
02:00:36,756 --> 02:00:41,923
Don't take him down with you.

1330
02:00:42,423 --> 02:00:45,923
Go on.. He's inside.

1331
02:01:01,839 --> 02:01:04,173
Guddu, go out.

1332
02:01:04,673 --> 02:01:07,798
All parts working?

1333
02:01:08,298 --> 02:01:12,048
Don't make me laugh, idiot.
It hurts

1334
02:01:12,548 --> 02:01:14,423
How's aunty?

1335
02:01:14,923 --> 02:01:19,131
She's in a coma.
- Oh God!

1336
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:23,131
How can this be happening to us?

1337
02:01:34,339 --> 02:01:35,506
Some dinner?

1338
02:01:36,006 --> 02:01:38,798
No, don't worry Aunty.

1339
02:01:39,298 --> 02:01:40,798
We just came to see Aslam.

1340
02:01:41,298 --> 02:01:42,964
We've got to get back to the hospital.

1341
02:01:43,464 --> 02:01:45,714
Take care.

1342
02:01:46,214 --> 02:01:49,214
See you.
Take care.

1343
02:01:49,714 --> 02:01:53,214
Take care.

1344
02:02:09,048 --> 02:02:13,381
Listen.. I..

1345
02:02:13,881 --> 02:02:17,381
I always.. I'm sorry.

1346
02:03:21,256 --> 02:03:24,756
Please eat.

1347
02:03:45,339 --> 02:03:49,548
Everything's falling apart..

1348
02:03:50,048 --> 02:03:53,548
.. and all I can do is stand and watch.

1349
02:03:59,048 --> 02:04:02,548
People like us don't count out here.

1350
02:04:06,631 --> 02:04:13,089
A hundred more Ajay's
can die and nothing will change.

1351
02:04:13,589 --> 02:04:17,089
..and nothing will change.

1352
02:04:45,089 --> 02:04:48,589
Ajay did everything right,
all his life.. yet..

1353
02:04:52,798 --> 02:05:00,131
.. he was a good pilot,
a good friend, a good son..

1354
02:05:00,631 --> 02:05:06,714
.. he never harmed a soul,
he never did anything wrong.

1355
02:05:07,214 --> 02:05:12,173
.. he didn't deserve this..
Everything is over suddenly.

1356
02:05:12,673 --> 02:05:16,173
.. Sonia didn't deserve this..

1357
02:05:29,506 --> 02:05:34,631
As I watched DJ sleep that night
a funny thought occurred to me..

1358
02:05:35,131 --> 02:05:37,423
.. maybe DJ wasn't sleeping.

1359
02:05:37,923 --> 02:05:41,423
Maybe none of them were.
Maybe they were all waking up.

1360
02:06:22,048 --> 02:06:26,339
Hey Karan.. they've spoilt your jacket.

1361
02:06:27,339 --> 02:06:30,839
Long live India!

1362
02:07:00,839 --> 02:07:03,923
The bastard got away with it again.

1363
02:07:04,423 --> 02:07:06,964
What can we do..

1364
02:07:07,464 --> 02:07:11,923
..when the law of the land protects
people like the Defence Minister.

1365
02:07:12,123 --> 02:07:15,664
We have to take drastic measures.

1366
02:07:16,464 --> 02:07:18,298
What drastic measures?

1367
02:07:18,798 --> 02:07:23,256
What do you want to do?

1368
02:07:23,756 --> 02:07:26,539
Kill him.

1369
02:07:27,339 --> 02:07:28,673
What?

1370
02:07:29,173 --> 02:07:33,298
Kill the Defence Minister!
Have you lost your mind?

1371
02:07:33,798 --> 02:07:35,131
We aren't killers Sonia.

1372
02:07:35,631 --> 02:07:36,839
But they are.

1373
02:07:37,339 --> 02:07:38,464
Have you lost it Karan!

1374
02:07:38,964 --> 02:07:41,423
It's not a blood lust..

1375
02:07:41,923 --> 02:07:43,039
.. it's a matter of justice.

1376
02:07:43,339 --> 02:07:44,506
I'll get the gun.

1377
02:07:45,006 --> 02:07:47,131
Don't instigate, Pandey.
We can't start killing..

1378
02:07:47,631 --> 02:07:49,923
.. people for any small reason.

1379
02:07:50,423 --> 02:07:53,381
You think Ajay's death is a small reason?
- Karan, Karan.

1380
02:07:53,881 --> 02:07:55,298
Ajay's mother is a small reason?

1381
02:07:55,798 --> 02:07:58,589
It is not the matter.
Understand me.

1382
02:07:59,089 --> 02:08:01,089
Lala Lajpat Rai's death has to be avenged.

1383
02:08:01,589 --> 02:08:02,839
Scott has to be killed.

1384
02:08:03,339 --> 02:08:06,839
But..

1385
02:08:13,548 --> 02:08:18,839
I always thought
we didn't believe in anything.

1386
02:08:19,339 --> 02:08:22,839
So did I. Until now.

1387
02:08:32,914 --> 02:08:34,081
You're insane.

1388
02:08:34,281 --> 02:08:38,281
We can get him in the morning,
 while he jogs.

1389
02:08:41,156 --> 02:08:45,156
Who's we, huh?
Who's going to pull the trigger?

1390
02:08:45,456 --> 02:08:49,123
I'll do it!

1391
02:08:50,115 --> 02:08:51,948
There's less security in the morning.

1392
02:08:52,448 --> 02:08:54,240
There's a chance of getting caught.

1393
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:58,240
No matter what we'll have
to take this chance.

1394
02:09:44,573 --> 02:09:46,198
The Defence Minister
was on his morning walk..

1395
02:09:46,698 --> 02:09:48,573
.. at 07:58AM with two body guards..

1396
02:09:49,073 --> 02:09:50,531
..when two unidentified gunmen opened fire.

1397
02:09:51,031 --> 02:09:52,073
He was hit by 3 bullets in his chest, and..

1398
02:09:52,573 --> 02:09:56,073
.. was declared dead on reaching hospital.

1399
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:09,490
Government spokesmen believe that this is..

1400
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:14,156
.. an attempt to destablize the govt.

1401
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:17,490
The country has lost a great leader because..

1402
02:10:17,990 --> 02:10:20,031
.. of the cowardly act of some terrorists.

1403
02:10:20,531 --> 02:10:22,531
He was a true soldier, a true patriot..

1404
02:10:23,031 --> 02:10:25,823
.. who sacrificed his life for the country.

1405
02:10:26,323 --> 02:10:31,531
His contribution to the country
cannot be described in words.

1406
02:10:32,031 --> 02:10:34,531
Sukhi!

1407
02:10:35,031 --> 02:10:36,031
Meanwhile our sources have discovered..

1408
02:10:36,531 --> 02:10:38,073
.. a telephonic conversation..

1409
02:10:38,573 --> 02:10:39,698
.. between the Late Defence Minister Shastri..

1410
02:10:40,198 --> 02:10:42,198
.. This conversation took place just a few..

1411
02:10:42,698 --> 02:10:46,156
.. days before the Defence Minister's murder.

1412
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:48,490
Sir, nothing to worry, the Russians want..

1413
02:10:48,990 --> 02:10:49,948
.. us to reduce our commission.

1414
02:10:50,448 --> 02:10:54,698
Didn't you tell them it's not a defence deal,
first it is our deal.

1415
02:10:55,198 --> 02:10:58,365
That's why I was also adamant,
this is the deal, if you want..

1416
02:10:58,865 --> 02:11:02,365
Let's go.

1417
02:11:07,365 --> 02:11:10,865
Come on.

1418
02:11:11,781 --> 02:11:18,490
V.K. Shastri was killed by two unidentified persons.

1419
02:11:18,990 --> 02:11:19,990
Paaji, where's DJ?

1420
02:11:20,490 --> 02:11:23,990
They were just here.

1421
02:11:27,823 --> 02:11:31,323
He hasn't come home all night.

1422
02:11:33,115 --> 02:11:36,281
Is everything alright?
- Yes.

1423
02:11:36,781 --> 02:11:40,281
He said he'd be spending the night at DJ's.
- Thank you.

1424
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:58,240
Have you seen DJ?

1425
02:11:58,740 --> 02:12:00,615
Is everything alright?

1426
02:12:01,115 --> 02:12:07,365
I can't find them or Sonia..
I don't know where they are.

1427
02:12:07,865 --> 02:12:14,323
Come with me...
Sit, sit.

1428
02:12:14,823 --> 02:12:18,948
Don't worry.. nothing will happen to these boys..
- But DJ..

1429
02:12:19,448 --> 02:12:21,531
Daljeet has always been a brat..

1430
02:12:22,031 --> 02:12:24,906
.. he used to disappear on his bike for days..

1431
02:12:25,406 --> 02:12:27,531
He used disappear for the whole night.

1432
02:12:28,031 --> 02:12:30,198
He is my only son,
if it had been two to four..

1433
02:12:30,698 --> 02:12:33,198
.. I would have slept easily.

1434
02:12:33,698 --> 02:12:35,240
I'm scared..

1435
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:38,281
Don't be afraid..

1436
02:12:38,781 --> 02:12:42,115
God will take care of everything..

1437
02:12:42,615 --> 02:12:46,115
God watches over the people we love.

1438
02:12:59,406 --> 02:13:02,365
Defence Minister.. the martyr..

1439
02:13:02,865 --> 02:13:10,865
.. one of India's favourite sons...
Bastard!

1440
02:13:11,365 --> 02:13:14,281
Read it. they're honoring him
with the Bharat Ratna.

1441
02:13:14,781 --> 02:13:19,198
All our efforts, wasted.

1442
02:13:19,698 --> 02:13:21,281
People need to know the truth.

1443
02:13:21,781 --> 02:13:23,698
Sure..

1444
02:13:24,198 --> 02:13:26,740
We and have to surrender ourselves for it.

1445
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:28,573
What?

1446
02:13:29,073 --> 02:13:33,490
Terrific! You want us to walk right..

1447
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:37,948
..in and give ourselves up!

1448
02:13:38,448 --> 02:13:39,490
And whom should we surrender to?

1449
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:42,156
The police are mere puppets.

1450
02:13:42,656 --> 02:13:44,531
So what should we do?
Should we just sit back?

1451
02:13:45,031 --> 02:13:48,323
Let them say anything.
- No! Let's kill them all!

1452
02:13:48,823 --> 02:13:50,781
Right Pandey? Bang! Bang! Bang!

1453
02:13:51,281 --> 02:13:54,581
Someone make him shut up!

1454
02:14:01,542 --> 02:14:04,750
You always knew that your father was in it.

1455
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:09,167
You knew everything.

1456
02:14:09,667 --> 02:14:12,625
No I didn't know, Sukhi..
- Sukhi is dead..

1457
02:14:13,125 --> 02:14:14,167
You're lying!

1458
02:14:14,667 --> 02:14:16,459
You always wanted to take
revenge on your father.

1459
02:14:16,959 --> 02:14:20,334
Sukhi, shut up!
- I won't shut up.

1460
02:14:20,834 --> 02:14:24,417
Who am I to say anything?
This Karan is only yours.

1461
02:14:24,917 --> 02:14:30,134
Hey Sukhi. - DJ he's used you..
- Shut up Sukhi.

1462
02:14:30,334 --> 02:14:32,459
.. he's used all of us, all of us.

1463
02:14:32,959 --> 02:14:37,500
Mark my words, he will be safe,
his father will bail him out.

1464
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,042
But we'll get caught. And I don't want to die DJ..
- Sukhi.

1465
02:14:42,542 --> 02:14:46,042
I don't want to die.

1466
02:14:50,209 --> 02:14:53,709
We did all this for Ajay.

1467
02:14:56,792 --> 02:15:00,292
What will happen now DJ?

1468
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:10,584
You've decided?
- Yes.

1469
02:15:11,084 --> 02:15:15,584
I need to know the truth..
don't worry.

1470
02:15:16,084 --> 02:15:19,542
I'm not worried.
Just don't be late.

1471
02:15:20,042 --> 02:15:22,667
The night is still young and the show's name is
'Raat Baki Baat Baki'

1472
02:15:23,167 --> 02:15:24,667
.. and I am Rahul, let's rock the party.

1473
02:15:25,167 --> 02:15:27,542
There's great DJ remixes coming up.

1474
02:15:28,042 --> 02:15:31,542
Nowadays new songs
don't work old songs are..

1475
02:15:35,125 --> 02:15:36,875
Nothing will happen to you Karan.

1476
02:15:37,375 --> 02:15:39,250
That's a promise
 nothing will happen to you.

1477
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:43,125
Just give me the names of the others.

1478
02:15:43,625 --> 02:15:45,125
I have good contacts.

1479
02:15:45,625 --> 02:15:47,292
I'll get you the best lawyers,
pull all the strings possible.

1480
02:15:47,792 --> 02:15:49,875
But I will get you out from it.

1481
02:15:50,375 --> 02:15:54,250
You just have to say that you
were forced into it..

1482
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:55,417
.. do you understand ?

1483
02:15:55,917 --> 02:15:59,625
And then you are out of this country.

1484
02:16:00,125 --> 02:16:03,375
Say something.
Do you get me?

1485
02:16:03,875 --> 02:16:06,542
Say something Damn it,
Your father's reputation..

1486
02:16:07,042 --> 02:16:08,709
..his life's work is at stake.

1487
02:16:09,209 --> 02:16:14,125
Why did you do it? Why did you do it?

1488
02:16:14,625 --> 02:16:15,500
Why did you do it, Dad?

1489
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,084
I.. What did I do?

1490
02:16:19,584 --> 02:16:21,875
These people don't fear death.

1491
02:16:22,375 --> 02:16:24,584
Ajay used to say..

1492
02:16:25,084 --> 02:16:30,042
..let death come..
anything for the country.

1493
02:16:30,542 --> 02:16:35,542
Ajay..

1494
02:16:36,042 --> 02:16:41,084
You'll handle it, out of the country.

1495
02:16:41,584 --> 02:16:47,084
Ajay was burnt alive..
not for the country.

1496
02:16:47,584 --> 02:16:49,667
You killed him!

1497
02:16:50,167 --> 02:16:52,292
You made him a joke..

1498
02:16:52,792 --> 02:16:55,334
I know you're very disturbed.

1499
02:16:55,834 --> 02:16:57,875
What has happened has happened.

1500
02:16:58,375 --> 02:17:01,375
Relax!
Let me handle things.

1501
02:17:01,875 --> 02:17:05,125
I'll find a way out.

1502
02:17:05,625 --> 02:17:06,959
Really Dad?
Is there a way out?

1503
02:17:07,459 --> 02:17:10,959
Of course.
There are many ways.

1504
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:17,250
Yes we'll go away from
this country tonight.

1505
02:18:18,625 --> 02:18:22,709
You don't have to do this..

1506
02:18:24,209 --> 02:18:27,042
I want to.

1507
02:18:27,542 --> 02:18:32,417
Sukhi, this might end badly.

1508
02:18:32,917 --> 02:18:38,709
Without you guys it will end
for me anyway..

1509
02:18:39,209 --> 02:18:42,709
Idiot.
Come.

1510
02:18:51,625 --> 02:18:55,125
Ajay passed away.
But his death won't go in vain, ma.

1511
02:19:03,084 --> 02:19:09,000
What is it about these boys
that make them have no fear?

1512
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:12,250
I think some times a person
can be pushed so..

1513
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:18,417
.. far that they reach a place beyond fear.

1514
02:19:18,917 --> 02:19:22,459
A place where we find
a strange peace where you..

1515
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:28,500
.. free yourselves to do the right thing.

1516
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,167
And sometimes that's the hardest thing to do.

1517
02:19:34,367 --> 02:19:35,984
Welcome back to Raat Baaki Baat Baaki.

1518
02:19:36,584 --> 02:19:39,417
This is Rahul, and you've tuned
in to your favourite radio show..

1519
02:19:39,917 --> 02:19:43,417
.. let's listen to R.D. Burman's
romantic music.

1520
02:21:02,486 --> 02:21:05,861
Hey Karan! What a surprise!
What're you doing here?

1521
02:21:06,361 --> 02:21:08,611
We need a favour.
- Sure!

1522
02:21:09,111 --> 02:21:10,253
I need you to put us on air.

1523
02:21:10,653 --> 02:21:15,070
I didn't understand.
Put you on air?

1524
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:17,111
Yeah, now! Live.

1525
02:21:17,611 --> 02:21:20,236
I want to go on air. Live.
Is it some kind of a joke?

1526
02:21:20,736 --> 02:21:23,611
That's impossible man..
I'll lose my job.

1527
02:21:24,111 --> 02:21:26,528
It's payback time.

1528
02:21:27,028 --> 02:21:32,153
Hey! It's your station.
Unreal man!

1529
02:21:32,653 --> 02:21:34,653
Gun..
He's got a gun!

1530
02:21:35,153 --> 02:21:37,945
Karan you go in.
I'll handle it.

1531
02:21:38,445 --> 02:21:46,736
Keep the show on.
Don't mess with us.

1532
02:21:47,236 --> 02:21:52,528
Come on.. leave, don't worry,
nothing will happen.

1533
02:21:53,028 --> 02:21:56,278
Paaji is anyone inside?

1534
02:21:56,778 --> 02:22:01,028
Uncle-ji run.
Don't stop.

1535
02:22:01,528 --> 02:22:06,945
Gun.. Security he's got a gun!

1536
02:22:07,445 --> 02:22:09,028
Don't be a wise guy.

1537
02:22:09,528 --> 02:22:12,028
Everybody leave!
Out! Move!

1538
02:22:12,528 --> 02:22:15,611
Everybody leave! Out! Move!

1539
02:22:16,111 --> 02:22:19,528
Don't panic we won't harm anyone.

1540
02:22:20,028 --> 02:22:22,778
Move! Move! Move!
Nothing will happen.

1541
02:22:23,278 --> 02:22:28,403
Move, Nothing will happen to you.

1542
02:22:28,903 --> 02:22:29,570
Nothing will happen to you,
don't worry, move..

1543
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:33,570
Hurry up, quick!
Till downstairs.

1544
02:22:50,445 --> 02:22:52,528
The time is 6:05 a.m. My name is Rahul..

1545
02:22:53,028 --> 02:22:56,445
.. And you're listening to
"The night is still young".

1546
02:22:56,945 --> 02:22:59,736
Today I've got a surprise guest for you.

1547
02:23:00,236 --> 02:23:02,403
An old friend of mine
Karan Singhania who just..

1548
02:23:02,903 --> 02:23:06,403
.. dropped in to say something
to all of you..

1549
02:23:12,311 --> 02:23:16,020
My name is Karan Singhania..
My friends and I..

1550
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:19,986
.. we killed the Defence Minister Shastri..

1551
02:23:20,486 --> 02:23:24,486
I repeat we killed the Defence Minister..

1552
02:23:24,986 --> 02:23:28,153
Ravi take me to the radio station quickly.
Hurry up!

1553
02:23:28,653 --> 02:23:34,278
We are not terrorists.
We aren't backed by any foreign organisation.

1554
02:23:34,778 --> 02:23:37,736
We don't even belong to
any political group..

1555
02:23:38,236 --> 02:23:40,820
We're just five students from
Delhi University.

1556
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:44,320
We killed the Defense Ministe
 because he murdered..

1557
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:49,361
.. our friend Flight Lieutenant
Ajay Rathod..

1558
02:23:49,861 --> 02:23:52,986
.. and many other Air Force pilots..

1559
02:23:53,486 --> 02:23:55,903
We killed him because after
he murdered Ajay,

1560
02:23:56,403 --> 02:23:58,903
.. he murdered his name..

1561
02:23:59,403 --> 02:24:02,403
Ajay's mother who not only sacrificed him..

1562
02:24:02,903 --> 02:24:05,486
.. but also her husband..

1563
02:24:05,986 --> 02:24:12,695
.. right now, is fighting for her life..

1564
02:24:13,195 --> 02:24:18,653
A Defence Minister is supposed
to safegaurd a nation. Not sell it.

1565
02:24:19,153 --> 02:24:22,070
Who will stop them?
Law.

1566
02:24:22,570 --> 02:24:23,570
Men like the Defence Minister aren't just..

1567
02:24:24,070 --> 02:24:26,070
.. above the law..
they control it.

1568
02:24:26,570 --> 02:24:28,986
We killed the Defence Minister because..

1569
02:24:29,486 --> 02:24:31,695
.. he was roaming scot-free..

1570
02:24:32,195 --> 02:24:35,028
.. even after committing such a big crime.

1571
02:24:35,528 --> 02:24:40,736
What we have done is wrong,
may be it's a crime.

1572
02:24:41,236 --> 02:24:47,111
But we could not see all this.
We have come here to surrender.

1573
02:24:47,611 --> 02:24:49,195
We have come here to tell everyone..

1574
02:24:49,695 --> 02:24:52,528
.. that we must do something.

1575
02:24:53,028 --> 02:24:58,195
We all have to do something.

1576
02:24:58,395 --> 02:24:59,995
We've just received news that the Defence..

1577
02:25:00,695 --> 02:25:02,653
.. Minister's assassins are hiding in the All India Radio building.

1578
02:25:03,153 --> 02:25:05,361
Karan Singhania and his friends are still with us.

1579
02:25:05,861 --> 02:25:13,486
Listeners can call in on
3291777.

1580
02:25:13,986 --> 02:25:17,486
Until then..

1581
02:25:23,857 --> 02:25:27,357
It's done.

1582
02:25:34,982 --> 02:25:38,107
"Hey, dude!"

1583
02:25:38,607 --> 02:25:46,440
"I just realized."

1584
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:54,357
"There's a fire burning within me."

1585
02:25:54,857 --> 02:25:58,149
"It's a new dawn."

1586
02:25:58,649 --> 02:26:02,107
"I can feel its light."

1587
02:26:02,607 --> 02:26:08,732
"Burn so bright, I could,
scorch the sun."

1588
02:26:09,232 --> 02:26:16,732
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1589
02:26:17,232 --> 02:26:25,124
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1590
02:26:26,024 --> 02:26:37,440
"The dream I once lost,
I've found."

1591
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:41,482
"It's blooming."

1592
02:26:41,982 --> 02:26:49,524
"It's melting."

1593
02:26:50,024 --> 02:26:57,232
"Notes arranging."

1594
02:26:57,732 --> 02:27:06,432
"Into a whole new melody."

1595
02:27:07,232 --> 02:27:10,649
Will they give us good food in jail?

1596
02:27:11,149 --> 02:27:14,649
Food?
Next he'll want beer.

1597
02:27:21,774 --> 02:27:23,440
You guys have become famous.

1598
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:26,440
Calls are pouring in from all over the country.

1599
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,149
Come on!
They want to talk to you..

1600
02:27:29,649 --> 02:27:34,065
Your news has spread everywhere.

1601
02:27:34,565 --> 02:27:36,315
Police!
- Police!

1602
02:27:36,815 --> 02:27:38,315
This is unreal man.
How did this happen?

1603
02:27:38,815 --> 02:27:41,315
Where did they come from?
This will ruin my career..

1604
02:27:41,815 --> 02:27:44,149
Quiet!
You move, Karan, get him out.

1605
02:27:44,649 --> 02:27:46,482
Karan you get on air..
We don't have much time..

1606
02:27:46,982 --> 02:27:48,440
They will catch us within Fifteen minutes..

1607
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:50,190
.. you go and say whatever you want.

1608
02:27:50,690 --> 02:27:54,190
Take care.

1609
02:27:56,565 --> 02:27:57,899
The Delhi police have reached the spot and..

1610
02:27:58,399 --> 02:28:00,315
.. are rescuing civilians trapped in the building.

1611
02:28:00,815 --> 02:28:02,482
The responsibility of the Minister's murder..

1612
02:28:02,982 --> 02:28:04,065
.. has just reached Calcutta.

1613
02:28:04,565 --> 02:28:07,149
I am in Bangalore and
as you can see all the students..

1614
02:28:07,649 --> 02:28:09,565
.. reporting from Mumbai's Churchgate area..

1615
02:28:10,065 --> 02:28:11,649
.. reporting from Cotton College, Guwahati.

1616
02:28:12,149 --> 02:28:13,732
.. reporting from S. P. College, Srinagar..

1617
02:28:14,232 --> 02:28:15,357
.. reporting from Lucknow University..

1618
02:28:15,857 --> 02:28:18,274
.. and the reactions are coming very fast.

1619
02:28:18,574 --> 02:28:21,324
Hi, my name is Prakash.
And I want to congratulate you.

1620
02:28:22,024 --> 02:28:23,065
You did the right thing by killing him.

1621
02:28:23,565 --> 02:28:27,065
All our ministers should be lined up and shot.

1622
02:28:27,565 --> 02:28:30,899
Mr. Prakash, who all will you shoot?

1623
02:28:31,399 --> 02:28:34,649
These corrupt ministers are
a reflection of our society.

1624
02:28:35,149 --> 02:28:36,524
We've chosen them.

1625
02:28:37,024 --> 02:28:39,274
If they are corrupt then so are we.

1626
02:28:39,774 --> 02:28:42,107
We need to change ourselves
to bring about a change.

1627
02:28:42,607 --> 02:28:43,899
Hello this is Principal Sharma,
Government..

1628
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:46,940
.. Higher Secondary School from Indore..

1629
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:48,399
You have set a bad example by taking..

1630
02:28:48,899 --> 02:28:52,190
.. the law into your own hands.

1631
02:28:52,690 --> 02:28:56,607
You're right sir.
We're sorry.

1632
02:28:57,107 --> 02:28:59,565
But give me the name of one politician who..

1633
02:29:00,065 --> 02:29:03,399
.. has gone to jail for his crimes.

1634
02:29:03,899 --> 02:29:05,774
Who else is on your hit-list?

1635
02:29:06,274 --> 02:29:08,482
We have no hit-list.

1636
02:29:08,982 --> 02:29:10,940
How do you feel after killing
the Defence Minister?

1637
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:14,982
We had no enmity.
It's not that we killed him and have cooled down.

1638
02:29:15,482 --> 02:29:18,982
We still have the rage within.

1639
02:29:35,315 --> 02:29:39,357
If you get caught you'll be hanged.
Aren't you afraid?

1640
02:29:39,857 --> 02:29:43,524
No.

1641
02:29:44,024 --> 02:29:48,149
As you can see the Black Cats
have reached the place.

1642
02:29:48,649 --> 02:29:54,149
And the boys who have killed
the minister are still inside.

1643
02:29:54,649 --> 02:29:56,982
Karan, I don't know whether
you did right or wrong..

1644
02:29:57,482 --> 02:30:01,607
..while we applaud your courage,
do you think you will get out alive?

1645
02:30:02,107 --> 02:30:05,440
Death doesn't scare us.

1646
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:09,440
No one should remain alive.
I don't want any survivor. - Yes sir.

1647
02:30:31,024 --> 02:30:33,274
Sukhi

1648
02:30:33,774 --> 02:30:35,524
Bullets are being shot in
All India Radio.

1649
02:30:36,024 --> 02:30:39,524
Ravi, please make him go quickly.

1650
02:30:45,774 --> 02:30:48,774
Shit! They're shooting at us DJ!
They're shooting at us!

1651
02:30:49,274 --> 02:30:55,149
Shut up for a second!

1652
02:30:55,649 --> 02:31:00,399
They're mistaking us for terrorists.
They think we're armed.

1653
02:31:00,899 --> 02:31:04,399
Don't worry,
I will handle it, Don't worry.

1654
02:31:17,482 --> 02:31:24,357
No.. Kill me.. Kill me..

1655
02:31:24,857 --> 02:31:34,607
Sukhi.. No Sukhi!
What did you do! What did you do?

1656
02:31:35,107 --> 02:31:44,065
Shit DJ! Just when I was getting good with the girls..
- No, Sukhi..

1657
02:31:44,565 --> 02:31:48,065
No, Sukhi..

1658
02:32:02,649 --> 02:32:04,149
My name is Indra. What's the difference..

1659
02:32:04,649 --> 02:32:05,857
.. between you and terrorists?

1660
02:32:06,357 --> 02:32:10,257
There's a big difference..
terrorists kill innocents, we didn't..

1661
02:32:19,857 --> 02:32:23,357
Aslam..

1662
02:32:25,899 --> 02:32:28,690
..close the door.
Quick!

1663
02:32:29,190 --> 02:32:32,690
We are not terrorists.
Why don't they..

1664
02:33:22,099 --> 02:33:25,224
It's not a lust for blood..
it's a matter of justice!

1665
02:33:25,324 --> 02:33:27,099
Why are bullets being used
when it's clear..

1666
02:33:27,899 --> 02:33:30,690
.. that these are college students?

1667
02:33:31,190 --> 02:33:34,690
This is Shomu Bose from
All India Radio for NDTV.

1668
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:19,863
No matter what you do, this country..

1669
02:35:20,363 --> 02:35:28,238
.. will never change.
It has no future.

1670
02:35:28,738 --> 02:35:32,238
No country is perfect.
You've got to make it perfect.

1671
02:35:37,705 --> 02:35:44,705
Join the police,
military, IAS..

1672
02:35:45,405 --> 02:35:50,113
Become a part of the political system..

1673
02:35:50,613 --> 02:35:57,196
This country will change..
We will change it!

1674
02:35:57,696 --> 02:35:59,113
If you believed the Defence Minister..

1675
02:35:59,613 --> 02:36:01,363
.. deserved to be punished then..

1676
02:36:01,863 --> 02:36:07,321
.. what about the allegations against your father?

1677
02:36:07,821 --> 02:36:11,196
Don't worry.. We'll find a way to fix this.

1678
02:36:11,696 --> 02:36:12,571
Is there any way out, Dad?

1679
02:36:13,071 --> 02:36:16,571
Of course, I am there, I will handle everything.

1680
02:36:32,780 --> 02:36:36,280
I'm sorry Dad..

1681
02:37:03,663 --> 02:37:06,738
My name is Daljeet Singh.

1682
02:37:07,238 --> 02:37:10,071
There are only two ways to live your life.

1683
02:37:10,571 --> 02:37:17,488
Tolerate things the way they are.

1684
02:37:17,988 --> 02:37:24,405
Or take responsibility to change them.

1685
02:37:24,905 --> 02:37:28,405
Karan Singhania killed his father
before coming here.

1686
02:37:37,155 --> 02:37:41,905
Shit DJ!

1687
02:37:42,105 --> 02:37:44,313
You're bleeding badly!

1688
02:37:45,113 --> 02:37:49,363
Relax!
It got tired of flowing in my veins.

1689
02:37:49,863 --> 02:37:52,946
It just wanted to be free.

1690
02:37:53,446 --> 02:37:56,571
Aslam.. Laxman.. Sukhi?

1691
02:37:57,071 --> 02:38:00,571
All gone.

1692
02:38:10,696 --> 02:38:17,321
.. Karan, I think I'm in love..

1693
02:38:17,821 --> 02:38:20,780
.. I never told you dude..

1694
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:27,905
.. can't stop thinking about her..

1695
02:38:28,405 --> 02:38:32,780
I know..
she's something else.

1696
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:36,780
You two'll make a great couple.

1697
02:38:41,196 --> 02:38:44,613
There's just one problem.
I don't know if...

1698
02:38:45,113 --> 02:38:48,613
.. the kids will be black or white.

1699
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:56,530
Damn Exhibitionist!

1700
02:39:11,821 --> 02:39:15,321
Let me go!
They're just boys, damn it!

1701
02:39:26,930 --> 02:39:30,346
I always believed that there were
two kinds of men in this world.

1702
02:39:31,446 --> 02:39:34,655
.. who go to their death screaming and men..

1703
02:39:35,155 --> 02:39:39,196
Men who go to their death in silence.

1704
02:39:39,696 --> 02:39:43,196
And then I met the third kind.

1705
02:40:29,046 --> 02:40:31,171
Sending the commandoes
is the death of democracy.

1706
02:40:31,671 --> 02:40:34,005
Today is a sad day in the history
of Indian politics.

1707
02:40:34,405 --> 02:40:36,696
We'll turn this small lamp
in to a huge fireball.

1708
02:40:36,796 --> 02:40:39,746
There will be an awakening
and will take a huge toll on corruption.

1709
02:40:40,246 --> 02:40:42,213
The truth has to come out
in some way and if it has..

1710
02:40:43,113 --> 02:40:44,613
.. to come out like this
then we are all for it.

1711
02:40:45,113 --> 02:40:49,446
We need such awakening
if we want every individual to step out.

1712
02:40:49,946 --> 02:40:51,488
Are we going to sit and do nothing?

1713
02:40:51,988 --> 02:40:52,863
So we have got to take some steps.

1714
02:40:53,363 --> 02:40:55,905
They have done it.
They have taken the right decision.

1715
02:40:56,405 --> 02:40:58,738
That day will come when
everything will be beautiful..

1716
02:40:59,238 --> 02:41:00,696
.. and there will be no corruption.

1717
02:41:01,196 --> 02:41:03,238
The fire that you have ignited
in our minds and hearts..

1718
02:41:03,738 --> 02:41:04,946
.. it's not going to fizz out very soon.

1719
02:41:05,446 --> 02:41:07,446
We will make sure that your dream goes till the end.
- We will do it.

1720
02:41:07,946 --> 02:41:11,446
Dear Lord, please accept
the sacrifice of the children.

1721
02:41:21,905 --> 02:41:26,863
I come here with Sonia
a lot just like old times.

1722
02:41:27,363 --> 02:41:31,072
And sometimes I hear the voices
carried by the evening breeze.

1723
02:41:31,572 --> 02:41:35,072
Not words just sounds,
sounds of laughter.

1724
02:42:00,205 --> 02:42:03,997
Come Bhagat Singh..

1725
02:42:04,697 --> 02:42:06,572
Father, what are you doing?

1726
02:42:07,072 --> 02:42:10,572
I'm sowing mango seeds.
If I plant one, it will reap thousands.

1727
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:40,963
"Hey, dude!"

1728
02:42:41,763 --> 02:42:49,597
"I just realized."

1729
02:42:49,997 --> 02:42:57,372
"There's a fire burning within me."

1730
02:42:58,072 --> 02:43:01,572
"It's a new dawn."

1731
02:43:02,072 --> 02:43:05,322
"I can feel its light."

1732
02:43:05,822 --> 02:43:11,947
"Burn so bright, I could, scorch the sun."

1733
02:43:12,447 --> 02:43:19,988
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1734
02:43:20,488 --> 02:43:28,780
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1735
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:40,572
"The dream I once lost, I've found."

1736
02:43:41,072 --> 02:43:44,655
"It's blooming."

1737
02:43:45,155 --> 02:43:52,655
"It's melting."

1738
02:43:53,155 --> 02:44:00,447
"Notes arranging."

1739
02:44:00,947 --> 02:44:08,613
"Into a whole new melody."

1740
02:44:09,113 --> 02:44:16,447
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1741
02:44:16,947 --> 02:44:26,072
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1742
02:44:26,572 --> 02:44:29,905
"The mist has cleared, I can see the sky."

1743
02:44:30,405 --> 02:44:33,822
"A new road, a new journey stands before me."

1744
02:44:34,322 --> 02:44:41,822
"If only you could stand by my side."

1745
02:44:42,322 --> 02:44:45,780
"The mist has cleared, I can see the sky."

1746
02:44:46,280 --> 02:44:49,697
"A new road, a new journey stands before me."

1747
02:44:50,197 --> 02:44:57,738
"If only you could stand by my side,

1748
02:44:58,238 --> 02:45:05,697
"This fire is ready to face any storm."

1749
02:45:06,197 --> 02:45:14,113
"The flames burn brighter and stronger."

1750
02:45:14,613 --> 02:45:21,863
"Whether I leave my mark."

1751
02:45:22,363 --> 02:45:30,072
"Whether I stay the path."

1752
02:45:30,572 --> 02:45:37,655
"Today I've tasted the light..

1753
02:45:38,155 --> 02:45:49,822
.. Like a torch, I'm burning bright."

1754
02:45:50,322 --> 02:45:57,905
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1755
02:45:58,405 --> 02:46:06,238
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1756
02:46:06,738 --> 02:46:10,113
"The mist has cleared, I can see the sky."

1757
02:46:10,613 --> 02:46:14,072
"A new road, a new journey, stands before me."

1758
02:46:14,572 --> 02:46:20,613
"If only you could stand by my side."

1759
02:46:21,113 --> 02:46:28,530
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1760
02:46:29,030 --> 02:46:37,405
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."
