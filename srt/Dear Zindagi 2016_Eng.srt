1
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,125
Priya, listen to me.
- Just let go of me, okay?

2
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,041
Priya, listen to me.. - You always
do this, it's always other women.

3
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,250
I didn't mean to hurt you. Come on!
- You always just..

4
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,625
Every time, you say the same thing.
- You know how much I love you.

5
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,083
Please, listen to me.

6
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:31,958
I love you.
I love you so much.

7
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,208
Cut! Great shot!

8
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,458
Make-up, please!
- Get me some water.

9
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,083
Kaira, good for you?

10
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,083
Guys, we'll do one more.

11
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:07,833
We got this shot, right?

12
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,125
We are running out of time. We don't
have permission for the whole day.

13
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,583
Kaira has a nice idea, we'll do one more.

14
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,625
What's the point of finishing on time
if we don't get a good shot?

15
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,833
Look, no respect for producers.

16
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,416
Especially these new cameramen..
Sorry! I mean, women.

17
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,333
Come on, hurry up, let's do this!

18
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,916
Fatima, we are going to change the guy.
So, can you.. - Yes! Okay..

19
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,125
You want that guy? Darwin! Come here.
- Yeah. You have to do the look.

20
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,750
One second.
- He has to look more handsome.

21
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,791
Just turn around.
Pull your pants up, please, and go there.

22
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,458
Hand me the camera.
- Action!

23
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,583
Please.. - You always do this,
it's always other women.

24
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,875
I'm tired. - I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,958
I love you.
I love you so much, please!

26
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,916
Cut!

27
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,250
Got that?
- Fantastic!

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,250
Superb execution!

29
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,125
Good shot. - I shot it at 48 frames,
speed up the end if you like.

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm going to take a plate
of the building now.

31
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,958
Did you see the shot, Raghuvendra?

32
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,375
That one expression of the girl
checking out the passing guy says so much.

33
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,583
I wish I had met Kaira earlier,
I would have shot the whole film with her.

34
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,208
I got that.
- It's a wrap, guys! Thank you!

35
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,541
Thank you, Nilin.
Thank you.

36
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,583
I told you,
you don't have to carry my bag. - Hey!

37
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,416
I'm so sorry.

38
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,916
Your mom called again on my cell phone.

39
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,333
You never pick up yours.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,750
Please call her back before you take off.
- Yeah, I will..

41
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,791
You enjoy your mini-holiday.

42
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,291
You could have enjoyed Singapore with us

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,791
but you wanted to fly
with someone else. - Shut up!

44
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,458
Go, go!

45
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,250
I tried to upgrade you, couldn't do it.

46
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,541
Please!

47
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,208
Hi, guys. What can I get for you?

48
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,291
Beer.
- Soft drink.

49
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,041
Okay.
- Just soft drink?

50
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,541
I drink only on two occasions,
when I am in love and when I am not.

51
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,208
Okay.

52
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,916
Cheers!

53
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,583
Kaira.. Is everything okay?

54
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,333
As in, we're good, right?

55
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,958
What are you talking about?
What happened to us?

56
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,583
Cheers!
- Cheers!

57
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,166
Raghuvendra, I want to shoot
an entire feature film.

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,916
Enough of this patchwork.

59
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,875
I mean, I can't keep waiting
for other cameramen to fall ill.

60
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,458
No one will even know
that I've shot this scene.

61
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,250
I want to shoot my own film.

62
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,458
You will. Who wouldn't want to work
with a beautiful DOP like you?

63
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,250
Beautiful! Is that my only talent,
seriously? - Seriously.

64
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,666
Don't talk to me.
- Of course, you're talented.

65
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,833
You shoot so many ads, you earn
good money. - Ads and all are fine.

66
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,041
I want to shoot a film.

67
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,250
You will.. Soon!

68
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,333
And you're so young, I mean..

69
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,916
The only reason you wear glasses
is to look older.

70
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,416
Excuse me!

71
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,125
If actresses can be at their peak
at a young age then why not technicians?

72
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,083
Tell me.
- Have you heard of the word <i>Patience?</i>

73
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,250
No, I haven't.
Tell me about <i>Patience</i>.

74
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,875
Pick up.. Pick up the cook's call.

75
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,125
If you want I can
just go and come back.. - Okay.

76
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,958
Firstly, he is not a cook,
he is the owner of a restaurant.

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,333
Not even a cook?

78
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,291
Tell me something.

79
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,583
That shot was your idea, right?

80
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,166
Girl with guy, checking out other guy..

81
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,208
Inspired from life?

82
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,166
<i>Passengers flying on SQ-422 to Mumbai..</i>

83
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,791
Great!
- Listen, Kaira..

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,833
You take my seat, I'll sit on yours.

85
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,958
I can sit in Economy class,
you need not sacrifice.

86
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,875
Besides, your long legs
won't fit in there, anyway.

87
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,916
That is true.
- It is very true.

88
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,958
Yes, Mom. It was good.

89
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,750
Okay, sorry. I can't talk now,
the plane is going to take off. Bye..

90
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,083
There you go.
- Thank you.

91
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,666
So.. Can I come up?

92
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,708
I'm really tired.
- Dinner?

93
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,708
I'm busy tonight, but I'll see you.

94
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,833
See you!
- See you..

95
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,750
Alka!
- Ma'am..

96
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,125
You've put on so much weight.

97
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, stop it, ma'am.

98
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,750
How was your shoot?
- Rubbish!

99
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,958
Rubbish?

100
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,916
Ma'am, you..

101
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,625
Ma'am.
- Yes.

102
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,333
Your mother called three times.

103
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,083
You are so sweet, Alka.
- Thank you!

104
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,416
Do you want coffee
or shall I serve breakfast?

105
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,458
Later.

106
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,458
Ma'am..

107
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,791
Ma'am.

108
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,375
This guy is so cute.

109
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,708
Was!
- What?

110
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,083
He was cute.

111
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,375
I don't find him cute anymore.

112
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,458
Actually, remove his photo.
Just take it out.

113
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,625
Ma'am..

114
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,750
I had just put it all in perfect order.

115
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,833
Now it's perfect.

116
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,291
I love you.

117
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,750
And you must try our chef's special today.
I'm sure, you'll love it. - Thank you.

118
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,083
Danish.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,000
Danish, take good care of our guests.

120
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,625
And make sure they try our new wines.

121
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,333
Sure, sir. Just a moment..
- Have a good evening.

122
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,750
Enjoy yourself. All right?
- Same to you. Bye.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,416
So then, how was your trip?

124
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,666
It was good.

125
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,791
Just good?

126
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,791
Okay, great.

127
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,500
You look beautiful, sweetheart.

128
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,791
Sid.

129
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,083
Hey, Tom!
- Hey, Sid.

130
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,958
How are you, buddy?
- Good. What's up?

131
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,375
Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

132
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,625
How was the vacation?
- It was great. Fantastic!

133
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,125
London, right?
- Exactly. Yes.

134
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,916
Excellent. Your table is ready.
- Thank you.

135
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,125
I'm sorry, I was..
- No, it's okay.

136
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,083
Go ahead, meet them.
I have to use the restroom, anyway.

137
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,458
Just..

138
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,583
Table for four, please.
- I'm sorry, guys.

139
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,875
We have a strict dress code.

140
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,416
No shorts and slippers, please.

141
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,250
Come on, it's his birthday.
- I'm sorry, I wish I could.

142
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,333
It's my birthday. Come on, do something.
- But she's wearing shorts!

143
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,541
It's okay for girls. I'm sorry, guys.
- What is this.. Come on..

144
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,500
We really want to party, please.
- Do something..

145
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,666
Please..

146
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,583
Do something. Allow us.
- Please..

147
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,333
Okay, sure. Please.
- Oh, wow! Thanks!

148
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,875
Guys, I'm really hungry.
- Just this once, only for you.

149
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:21,333
Next time, I'll come along
on a shoot with you, as your caterer.

150
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,375
What do you say?

151
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,875
Hey..

152
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,041
I slept with Raghuvendra.

153
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:52,083
I should go. I should go..

154
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,166
Sid.

155
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,791
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,500
Thank you.

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,250
What are you doing!
What are you doing!

158
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,291
Stop! It's all good!
All good!

159
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,625
What are you doing?

160
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,166
Hey, look, Sid!
- Sid! Where?

161
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,708
That's not Sid, Jackie.
- No?

162
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,083
Oh! He looked so much like him!

163
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,750
Cute!

164
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,375
Poor thing! Nice guy he was!

165
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,041
Yeah, really nice!

166
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,166
Little too nice for you, right?

167
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,541
Okay. Let's go.

168
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,458
Oh, my God! This jacket!

169
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,541
It reminds me of school,
our <i>Famous Five</i> gang.

170
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,583
Was that the 8th or 9th grade?

171
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,666
Tenth grade. It's the same one.

172
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,333
See, I can have
a long-term relationship too.

173
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,916
Yes, with things.

174
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,916
So, are we things too?

175
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,833
Yes, you are a thing.

176
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,416
You're the most beautiful..
Oh, sorry!

177
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,291
Have you gone blind in love?
Am I invisible? - We said sorry.

178
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,250
Why is she yelling..
- Relax..

179
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,666
Staring into her eyes!
- They are a couple.

180
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,250
<i>Oh, you're so cute!
So sweet! I love you..</i>

181
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,791
The same rubbish! It's irritating.
- Hey! What are you doing?

182
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,166
To heck with them.

183
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,208
Stupid!
- Sorry.

184
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,750
I hate couples!

185
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,750
She's here..
- Pose!

186
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,791
Are you guys here to help me
or to do a comedy show?

187
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,833
Both. - Guys, I have a deadline. I have
to show the costumes to the director.

188
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,916
Fine. Look..
- Okay.

189
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,041
Raunak, do you need help?
- Okay, guys. Listen.

190
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,833
I've to go, I have my B-D appointment.
- What's this B-D?

191
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,708
Brain Doctor, my therapist.

192
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,750
Oh, B-D..
Raunak, you're still going to that B-D?

193
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,208
I have to. - Brain Doctor?
Why are you seeing a therapist?

194
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,916
Are you mad?
- Who isn't? Look at him.

195
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,458
Roll..
- Clap!

196
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,958
Trolley. Action!

197
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,416
Chocolaty!
- That's a cut. Nice!

198
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,250
Good for you, Kaira?
- Yes, good for me.

199
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,541
Okay, guys. Ten minutes' break.

200
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,291
<i>Rubbish! I can direct better than this.</i>

201
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,416
Tell me something..

202
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,583
Why did you start seeing your therapist?

203
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,916
So that you could tell everyone
that you're gay?

204
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,916
No.

205
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,875
So that I could tell myself that I'm gay.

206
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,875
When is your flight to Goa?

207
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,458
Don't remind me! I can't believe
I'm going to Goa. Seriously!

208
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,375
Seriously, you're the first human being
who's saying this so sadly.

209
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,416
Really!
- That's true.

210
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,791
It's Goa! Enjoy.
- Shut up.

211
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,625
And yes, it is sad.

212
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,291
Because I'm going on duty.

213
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,833
Every 2-3 months, I have to go.

214
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,750
Oh! Is it Raghu?
- It's duty!

215
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,166
Yes, Mom. I'm coming tomorrow.

216
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,583
What's with this food, every time!

217
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,500
Cook what you like, don't ask me.

218
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,000
Because I'm busy.

219
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,416
Mothers!
Standard question, every time..

220
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,166
<i>What will you eat?
What should I make?</i>

221
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,916
Either she isn't my real mother
or she's got Alzheimer's. - Kaira!

222
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,291
At least eat my food.

223
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,250
Only way to handle the torture..

224
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:30,166
I think, this time, I'll work
on my short film. - Short film!

225
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,458
Sorry.
- The longest project of this century.

226
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,583
That's so mean.
- It's true.

227
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,666
Okay. How do you like my French food?

228
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,541
Why is the landlord calling?
- I don't know about French food

229
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,416
but this dip is amazing!

230
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,708
Really?
- Full Indian spice, try it.

231
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,958
The dip is from Kaira's fridge. I've made
the puff pastries. - It looks quite nice.

232
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,208
Smile.
- Jackie, at last you made something.

233
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,708
What do you mean, at last?

234
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,291
You people from the film industry think
that only you do important work

235
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,583
and the rest of us are useless!
- Good point.

236
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:03,416
I have decided to work on myself.
- That's tough work.

237
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,416
Do it..
- Do it!

238
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,333
Hey, what..
- What's wrong with you?

239
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,708
I'm not going to Goa! Guess what!

240
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,041
Your friend, Raghu, called

241
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,708
and I have to shoot a music video here,
in three days!

242
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,250
We've to shoot a music video
in three days. Now, get ready! - Okay.

243
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,000
Come on, dance with me.
- I have never seen anybody so excited

244
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,416
upon not going to Goa.
- "No Goa!"

245
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,625
"No Goa! No Goa! No Goa!"

246
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,250
What happened to her?

247
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,833
It's not because of my food.

248
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,416
Okay, everybody, just get away
from the table. - It's not my food!

249
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,333
This food is contaminated.

250
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,916
Hey, Fatima. You're good? Yes?
- Kaira.

251
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,500
Guess what!
- What's up?

252
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,041
I am pregnant!
- What!

253
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,958
It wasn't Jackie's food.

254
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,041
Oh, my God, Fatty!
Congratulations!

255
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,875
I mean, we're supposed to be
happy, right? - I don't know..

256
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,750
I want to throw up right now.

257
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,166
I swear, I do.
- Fatty..

258
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,291
Hello.
- Hi.

259
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,958
Should I go?
- Yes, please.

260
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,416
Okay! - No! - No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just very excited.

261
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,166
Are you pregnant too?
- What..

262
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,708
So, I was working on a co-production
with this New York film company

263
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,333
and it has come through.
- That's amazing! Congratulations!

264
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,625
Thank you. - Wow, you are going
to be shooting a feature in the US?

265
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,458
Yes. Superb!
- Tell me more. Good script?

266
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,791
Are you going to be filming in New York?

267
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,166
You are going to be filming in New York.

268
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,791
As in, we are going
to be filming in New York.

269
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,666
If you're not available,
we'll get another camera person..

270
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,041
Oh, my God!
I will kill you!

271
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,375
Told you, not going to Goa is lucky.

272
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,708
Lucky for you, unlucky for me.

273
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,500
I want to kill my husband..

274
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,500
You're sure, right?

275
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,166
It's not because
you think I'm attractive, right?

276
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,708
Obviously.. You thought,
it's because you're talented?

277
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,750
You are so crazy!
Why are you so complicated?

278
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,708
You're the best, that's why
you got the job. Simple!

279
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,875
Thank you. Seriously!
Thank you.

280
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,125
All right.
- Brilliant.

281
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:37,041
Kanju, what is happening
with the haze machine over there?

282
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,958
Great boys.
More energy! Come on, guys.

283
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:47,208
"I don't know..
I don't know how to hide it!"

284
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,875
Okay, let's go for a take, guys.

285
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,166
And, music!
One, two, three, four..

286
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,958
"So, let's break up.
Oh, my darling!"

287
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:00,125
"Let's break up.
Oh, please agree to it!"

288
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:05,166
"You and I will never work out.
Oh, let it go!"

289
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,583
"So, let's break up!"

290
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,500
"Oh, my darling!"

291
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,041
"Let's break up!"

292
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,041
"Oh, please agree to it."

293
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:19,875
"You and I will never work out.
Oh, let it go!"

294
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,583
One, two, three, four!

295
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,333
"When I see"

296
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,458
"a beautiful girl"

297
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,708
"I get so excited!"

298
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,666
"Basically.."

299
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,333
"Basically, I'm a rascal!"

300
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,458
Cut!
- Got it.

301
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,750
It's a wrap!

302
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,083
Cheers!

303
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,208
Good.. Wow, congratulations!
- Thank you!

304
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,250
You will really be fat now!

305
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,375
Cute guy!

306
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,208
So many men in your life.
- Shut up!

307
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,541
You will get to spend time
with Raghu also

308
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,333
when you are in New York,
shooting for three months.

309
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,666
Hello, ladies, and one gentleman.
- Hi, Raghu!

310
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,916
Excuse me!
- Oh, sorry! Two gentlemen.

311
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,958
Can I steal Kaira for a minute?
Just for a minute, please! - No..

312
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,208
Thief! Even we want to hear.
- What?

313
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,500
Even we want to hear!

314
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,458
What? I can't hear anything.
- Even we want to hear!

315
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,916
One whisky on the rocks, please.

316
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,666
Yes. - So..
- Okay, pose.

317
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,083
Nice one!
- He's photo bombing again!

318
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,625
So, I'm off to New York tonight.

319
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,875
What?
- Yes.

320
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,125
The financiers want to meet urgently.

321
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,208
Someone has to fly so that you can.

322
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,208
Okay, go. Fly!

323
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,958
Have a nice flight.

324
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,333
That's it?

325
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,583
Have a nice flight?

326
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,125
What else should I say?

327
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,250
Say something.

328
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,041
You pulled me here, you say something.

329
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,375
Firstly, stop looking so attractive.

330
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,333
Tie your hair up.

331
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,083
And behave yourself, just for two weeks.

332
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,541
Here you go. Are you happy now?

333
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,708
Very happy.
- How do I look?

334
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,500
Lovely!

335
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,333
So, I had to talk to you
about something..

336
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,708
Hi..

337
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,750
Do you want to hit the dance floor?

338
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,541
Hello, mister.
- Hey..

339
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,833
We're just in the middle
of a conversation. - Sorry..

340
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,666
Yes..
- Okay!

341
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,750
Anyway, you were saying..

342
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,708
I was saying that..

343
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,208
Gautami..
- Who?

344
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,541
Gautami Sharma will be
the line producer of the film.

345
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,583
Okay. So?

346
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,250
The financiers have recommended her.

347
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,083
They think, she is the best person
for this job.

348
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,666
What are you trying to say?
- So..

349
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,250
Gautami and I, many years ago

350
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,208
were in a relationship.

351
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,708
Okay, it's a reunion!
That's amazing.

352
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,250
Okay, enjoy.
- Reunion, my foot!

353
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,833
It's going to be a really
awkward situation.

354
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,833
I-I mean, she was such a weird one!

355
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,500
I don't even feel like seeing her.

356
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,625
I just want the job to go smoothly,
that's it!

357
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,708
And I thought you should know.
- Yes.

358
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,500
Cool! Whatever..

359
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,958
What do you mean? Come here..

360
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,958
I have someone else
on my mind for a while now.

361
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,875
Look, I think it's..

362
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:16,958
It's time that we got serious
about each other.

363
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,125
I think it's time that you go.

364
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,458
Do you want to miss your flight?

365
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,958
Kaira, I'm serious. I'm not joking.

366
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,166
We really should..

367
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,375
Sir, we have a flight to catch..
- Yes..

368
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,458
Sir, it's late.
- Yes. Okay..

369
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,583
Go!

370
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,708
It's okay, go on.

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,666
It's fine.
- Really?

372
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,333
You don't have anything else to say?

373
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,583
No, that's it for now.

374
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,291
See you, bye.

375
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,291
Way to go!

376
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,125
What did I miss?
- Shots!

377
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,750
Shots! Shots!

378
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,875
Shots! Shots!

379
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,833
"So, let's break up."

380
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,791
"Oh, my darling."

381
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,416
"Let's break up!"

382
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,958
"Oh, please agree to it."

383
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,583
"Things will never work out
between you and me. Oh, let it go!"

384
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,166
"When I see"

385
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,250
"a beautiful girl"

386
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,833
"I get so excited!"

387
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,291
"Basically.."

388
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:18,875
"Basically, I'm a rascal!"

389
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,583
"But you're no less, baby."

390
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,416
"Somedays, you're nice"

391
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,041
"and somedays, you're not."

392
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,875
"Basically.."

393
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,375
"Basically, you're a witch too!"

394
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,958
"So, let's break up."

395
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,958
"Oh, my darling!"

396
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,625
"Let's break up!"

397
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,125
"Oh, please agree to it."

398
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:47,666
"You and I will never work out.
Oh, let it go!"

399
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,541
"So, let's break up."

400
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,625
"Oh, my darling!"

401
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,375
"Let's break up!"

402
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,791
"Oh, please agree to it."

403
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,541
Koko, why don't you think
seriously about Raghuvendra?

404
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:04,416
He is the right guy for you.

405
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,083
This is why some people should not drink.

406
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,125
Why should she think about Raghuvendra?

407
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,291
Is he the last man in the world?
- Why shouldn't she consider him?

408
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,291
I will tell you point by point

409
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:22,958
why Raghuvendra
is the perfect guy for Koko. Okay?

410
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,750
Point number 1..

411
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,833
And this is the most important
point in the world, okay? - Tell, Jackie.

412
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:32,541
He is good looking. Come on!

413
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:37,291
Hardly two percent of people in the world
look good.

414
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,916
And if you have to spend
your life with somebody

415
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,541
you should at least see
a handsome face every morning.

416
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:46,250
Point number 2..

417
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,166
He has a great sense of humor.

418
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:53,666
More laughter means more intimacy!

419
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,833
Where are you getting
this information from? - Intimacy..

420
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,250
Point number 3..

421
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:03,500
He understands your profession, your job.

422
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,583
If you marry a software engineer

423
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,666
or a farmer

424
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,125
what will you discuss at dinner?

425
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,416
Virus or cow dung?

426
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,458
Excuse me!
My husband is a software engineer.

427
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:19,375
And we have many interesting discussions.
Okay? - Like what?

428
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,125
Like a lot of things!
- Like what?

429
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,541
And I'm sure, farmers are interesting too.

430
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:26,041
They can tell us about organic vegetables.

431
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,833
They can tell you how to milk a cow.

432
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,625
Go, marry a farmer.

433
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:33,958
Ganju, tell them that I'm right.

434
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,083
Yes, please give us
your male point-of-view.

435
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,791
Guys, just shut up!

436
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,416
This is all pointless

437
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,583
because he's going to meet
his ex-girlfriend

438
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,791
in New York.
So, just shut up!

439
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,916
Ex-girlfriend!
That's just great!

440
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:56,083
She is gone, that's in the past.
- Just punch her!

441
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:59,708
No, the important question here is..
Move your leg.

442
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:04,541
Are you his present? Now..

443
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,625
William Faulkner once said..

444
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,416
<i>The past is never dead.
In fact, it's not even the past.</i>

445
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,416
What?
- Did your therapist teach you that?

446
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:19,208
Hey, I want to go
to this therapist of his.

447
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,541
Raguu!

448
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,791
Okay, take it.

449
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,375
No, I don't need it.

450
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,833
Stop acting pricey!
I know, you like Raguu.

451
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,250
No, I don't.

452
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,166
Take it, keep it.

453
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,166
It's so tasty! So delicious!

454
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,625
Yuck, Jackie, so cheap!

455
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:10,916
I love the taste of Raguu.

456
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,041
Have you gone mad?

457
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:17,458
Limited offer, grab it now!
- Yes.

458
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,375
You've gone mad.

459
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,541
Pasta!

460
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:43,375
<i>I shouldn't be so desperate.
I should wait for him to call.</i>

461
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,041
Here is some water.

462
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,833
Ma'am, new photo?

463
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,166
Yes. It's nice, isn't it?

464
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,500
Eat quickly, or it will get cold.

465
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:08,291
Raguu! Raguu..

466
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,416
Just crush the blacks.

467
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,791
More. More.. More!

468
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,416
See..
- Yes!

469
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,958
More..

470
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,416
More.

471
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,375
Right here?
- Yes.

472
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,333
Yes, okay. Let's play.

473
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,458
Much better! See.. Much better.
- Yes..

474
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,833
It's looking nice.
- Yes, much better.

475
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,500
Okay. Now, pause and zoom in.

476
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,708
Darn! Ganju!
I told you to remind me at 3 p.m.

477
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,250
I had to take Fatima to the doctor.

478
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:43,250
Fatty! I'm so sorry..
I'm just leaving.

479
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:47,583
No, you wait. I'm coming there,
to eat <i>Vada Pav</i> at the canteen.

480
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,750
My doctor's appointment got cancelled.

481
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,500
This landlord..

482
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,416
Hello.

483
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,458
What!

484
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,833
You are not going to believe this.

485
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,583
Being single is now a crime!
- What?

486
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:15,083
My landlord is kicking me out
of my apartment! - What!

487
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:18,125
I'm going to join the ranks
of homeless in Mumbai.

488
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,041
And you want to know why?

489
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,750
Did I damage the apartment?
No!

490
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,666
Did I forget to pay rent?
No!

491
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,375
The building committee
just got together and decided

492
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,250
that only married couples
and families can live there.

493
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,250
I mean, is that even legal?
- Oh, my God. This just happened?

494
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,250
Yes, he just called!

495
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,583
I had been avoiding his calls
all these days.

496
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,458
Fatty, I have to vacate the house
by the end of the month.

497
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,083
I don't know what to do!
- These people are unbelievable!

498
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:45,166
Mumbai, India's most modern,
cosmopolitan city.

499
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,666
Seriously!

500
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,666
Listen, I hope you know
that you can stay with me.

501
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,583
Yes, that's not the point.

502
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,500
In a way, thank God..

503
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,416
Thank God I'm leaving this city
and this country for this project.

504
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,375
But seriously, what thinking!

505
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:07,375
No marriage means no home for women?
I mean..

506
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,750
Why don't they make a law

507
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,458
that no one can stay
with in-laws after marriage?

508
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,333
Forget it.

509
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:23,333
So, when is the New York shoot?

510
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,791
I don't know.

511
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,833
I think I will know
the exact dates in a month

512
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,791
when the man returns.

513
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,458
The man has not called?

514
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,208
Raghuvendra has not called?

515
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,875
No.
- Okay.

516
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,833
What okay?

517
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,083
What?

518
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,041
Why do you look so suspicious?

519
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,833
Fatty? Tell me.

520
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:52,125
He got engaged.
- What?

521
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,875
He got engaged.

522
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,500
I'm sorry, who got engaged?

523
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,500
Raghuvendra.

524
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,375
When?

525
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,375
Last week.

526
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,916
Last week?

527
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:12,666
He was just here,
I mean, he just left.. - I know..

528
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:17,541
Who told you? How do you know?
- Ajay, that guy from production..

529
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,791
Just one second.
Not even a message..

530
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,416
Who told you?

531
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:25,583
Ajay, from production,
he went to New York with Raghuvendra.

532
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,541
He got engaged?

533
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,416
I don't believe this! To whom?
- Koko..

534
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:35,458
Please, one second. How can he?
- Koko..

535
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,875
God! This is just getting worse.

536
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,333
How could he..

537
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,083
Are you okay?
- It's just the chili.

538
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,958
You want to know to whom?

539
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,333
No.

540
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,291
Okay, playback.
- Yes.

541
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,875
Excuse me, ma'am.

542
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,125
Sorry, it slipped.

543
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,458
"Where do I go from here?"

544
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,416
"Where do I hide?"

545
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:20,416
"How do I put my heart into something
when it is broken?"

546
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,333
"I've parted from myself."

547
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,291
"I'm separated from myself."

548
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:31,958
"How do I settle my broken heart?"

549
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:37,166
"Oh, my hurting heart!"

550
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:43,541
"Oh, my lying heart."

551
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:49,416
"Oh, my broken heart."

552
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,375
"What's your problem?"

553
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,500
"To heck with you, my heart!"

554
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:04,375
"To heck with you, my heart!"

555
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:10,250
"To heck with you, my heart!"

556
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:16,375
"To heck with you, my heart!"

557
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:22,791
"To heck with you, my heart!"

558
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,291
I don't believe this.

559
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:28,250
I'm going back to Goa.
Back to square one!

560
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,500
It's just for one month

561
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:33,750
then, the New York shoot will start.

562
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,291
Won't it?
- I don't know..

563
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,541
Personal and professional lives..

564
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:43,875
Always keep them separate.

565
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,541
You always say this.

566
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,416
When will you ever use this?

567
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,041
You buy such strange things.

568
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,500
Oh, gosh! I have to live
with my parents for a month.

569
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,208
How am I going to do it?

570
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,041
Stay with me in my house.

571
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,708
I'm also going to be in Goa.

572
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,291
We'll do Yoga together.

573
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,458
Do Yoga in your fancy holiday house.

574
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,458
I wish my parents
would buy me a villa in Goa.

575
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:07,958
Guess what?

576
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:12,875
When I reach Goa, I have to do
a beautiful shoot for my dad. - What?

577
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,208
Has he also joined the film business?

578
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,625
No, Jackie..

579
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,291
He wants me to shoot a promotional video
for his friend's restaurant.

580
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,583
But who knows? This could be
the turning point in my life.

581
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,833
"Is it my fault"

582
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:38,416
"or your own mistake?"

583
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,375
"Shamed heart"

584
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,750
"please tell me"

585
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:47,458
"what do we gain now"

586
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,458
"or what do we lose?"

587
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,416
"Shamed heart"

588
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,500
"crying over it will be worthless."

589
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:01,375
"Oh, my hurting heart!"

590
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:08,333
"Oh, my lying heart!"

591
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:13,666
"Oh, my broken heart!"

592
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:16,833
"What's your problem?"

593
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:20,625
"To heck with you, my heart!"

594
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,791
So, Koko..

595
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,708
Have you met Salman Khan yet?

596
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,833
Oh, my God, Sallu!

597
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,833
Is he as handsome in real life?

598
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,500
Does he actually have
those perfect set of abs?

599
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,916
Or is that just how it looks on screen?

600
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,750
Tell me, Koko, I'm dying to know!

601
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,750
First of all, I haven't met him.

602
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,208
And if I ever meet him,
I'm not going to tell him

603
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,041
<i>Take off your shirt.
I want to see your perfect abs!</i>

604
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,125
Exactly..

605
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,666
Forget about that.
Tell us about your ad with Dhoni.

606
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,250
One second, Dad.

607
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:54,916
Hello!

608
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:58,541
Salman Khan?
Abs? Really?

609
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:03,666
Stop bugging her
with all of your stupid talks. - Hey!

610
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,458
Talk about the important issue.

611
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,916
Yes, Ashu.

612
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:11,875
Firstly, she should be doing a proper job

613
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,125
in an office.

614
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,166
You know, something more respectable.

615
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,708
That's when we can seriously
talk to people about her marriage.

616
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:23,166
But why will she do some other job?

617
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,250
She's done a cinematography course
in New York.

618
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,333
She is brilliant at her job
and she's still young.

619
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,541
She won't be young forever.
All the good boys will be taken.

620
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,791
That's my biggest worry, you know..
- I know.

621
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,416
Come, dear.
- Come..

622
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:49,541
So, Kaira, tell me..

623
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,791
Are you a..

624
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,666
Are you a Lebanese?
- What?

625
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,583
It's not Lebanese.

626
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,041
It is lesbian! Lesbian!

627
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:09,375
Yes.. Are you a lesbian?

628
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,583
Oh, my God..

629
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:25,833
Well, if I were, would that stop you
from talking about my marriage?

630
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,500
Even if you are,
it won't make a difference.

631
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:32,166
Homosexuality is common
in the film industry.

632
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,166
You're right.

633
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,875
Be it stars or the spot boys,
everyone is gay.

634
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,541
It's the hub of homosexuals, you know!

635
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,708
Really?

636
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,416
Really?

637
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,083
Of course not!

638
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,250
Do you people even hear yourselves?

639
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,458
It's such rubbish!
That's what I want to tell you.

640
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,166
The film industry doesn't
have more homosexuals.

641
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,666
They're just more accepting.

642
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,500
There are as many homosexual people
in the world.

643
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,291
You might have a few in your office too.

644
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,750
But sadly, they have
to hide their true identity.

645
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,916
So..

646
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,083
Are you one?

647
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,500
A lesbian?

648
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,208
No, unfortunately not.

649
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:19,666
Then why don't you settle down?

650
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:22,458
We're just worried about you, Koko.
That's why..

651
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,583
If you keep spending time
with the guys from your industry

652
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,416
how will you find a nice boy?

653
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:31,416
Those guys are okay for checking out abs,
but not to marry?

654
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,333
How much more junk food
are you going to eat!

655
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,583
I've made all this for you.
Eat this!

656
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:42,041
For me? Have you ever seen me eat this?
Tell me.

657
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,833
I thought you like Paneer..

658
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,708
You used to eat it earlier, didn't you?

659
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:51,708
That's why I keep asking what you want.
You are the limit!

660
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,291
Anyway, dinner is served.
Come on. Let's get up.

661
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,541
Take your glasses. Come on.
- More drink?

662
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,750
No, thanks.
- Come, baby. Come..

663
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,333
You know, Koko

664
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:14,083
getting married before the age of 25

665
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:17,958
can reduce the divorce rate by 50 percent.

666
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:23,125
I know a 100 percent chance of no divorce.

667
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:25,750
Don't get married.

668
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,958
I'm leaving.
I'm going to stay with Jackie.

669
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,375
Koko..

670
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:43,166
"I'm addicted to pain."

671
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:48,125
"Even my tears laugh at me."

672
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:54,208
"Why do I keep punishing myself?"

673
00:43:54,375 --> 00:44:00,166
"Somebody, save me from myself."

674
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:03,500
What about New York?
What about the New York project?

675
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:09,583
"Oh, my hurting heart."

676
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:15,625
"Oh, my lying heart."

677
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:21,625
"Oh, my broken heart."

678
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,416
"What's your problem?"

679
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:27,333
"To heck with you, my heart."

680
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:36,083
"To heck with you, my heart."

681
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:41,875
"To heck with you, my heart."

682
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:47,875
"To heck with you, my heart."

683
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,833
"To heck with you, my heart."

684
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,583
Why are you asking me if I slept well?

685
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,333
If I say no, what can you possibly do?

686
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,125
I don't care what people think.

687
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,083
I'm not going to stay with you
for other people.

688
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,166
Don't irritate me
early in the morning, please!

689
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,916
Good morning, is it?

690
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,833
Now it's a good morning.

691
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,875
If your night is not good

692
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,958
then how will your morning be good?

693
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,958
I think, I should be
a night security guard.

694
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,500
Should I take an appointment
with a doctor?

695
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:25,750
Who is that?
- He moved in here a few weeks ago.

696
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:28,583
To write something..
He's a writer, I guess.

697
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:31,916
Nice guy.

698
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,458
Take an appointment with him?

699
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,208
There she is, my talented daughter.
- Hi.

700
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,958
She shoots with all Bollywood celebrities.

701
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,333
That's wonderful.

702
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,166
I know this is a small job for you

703
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:48,541
but this new restaurant video
is very important for us.

704
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:51,041
Thank you so much for doing this.
- No, it's fine.

705
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,000
Actually, we should start.
The camera setup will take a while.

706
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,541
Yes, she is very professional, you know!
- Great!

707
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:59,041
During work, she focuses only on work.

708
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:02,416
Dad! Can we stop all these
useless formalities? - Wonderful..

709
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,666
I need to get this done.
I only have a day. Let's go. - Okay.

710
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:10,083
Get the 24-70 ready.
I have tried everything, Ganju. - Okay.

711
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,541
Even sleeping pills.. But nothing works.

712
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:16,250
Try Reiki. My grandmother also tried it.

713
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,500
Shut up and set up!

714
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,208
Remove all this.
What's all this rubbish!

715
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,208
I am sorry, sir.
This can't be moved right now.

716
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:29,958
Only after this session ends.

717
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,916
What! We have to wait?

718
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,166
Then why did you call us?

719
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,708
Ma'am, the session is going on.

720
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,291
Madness!

721
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,791
<i>National Convention
for Mental Health Awareness.</i>

722
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,583
It's a gathering of therapists.

723
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:44,583
It's Raunak's playground, isn't it?
Should we go in?

724
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:47,166
Shut up and sit.

725
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,625
Here?
- Just sit.

726
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:55,916
<i>Thank you, Dr. Shah.</i>

727
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:59,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
that concludes our final session</i>

728
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,833
<i>with our esteemed speakers today.</i>

729
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,166
<i>The floor is now open to questions.</i>

730
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,541
I've done a shot breakdown,
you want to see? - I'm sleeping.

731
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:08,958
<i>Dr. Chopra, therapy,
counseling, analysis..</i>

732
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,666
<i>So many big terms..
What do they actually mean?</i>

733
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,833
A proper map can be drawn

734
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,541
after defining commonly accepted
medical terms.

735
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:22,541
If your problem or illness
falls in those definitions

736
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:25,333
your prognosis will tell you
your diagnosis.

737
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:28,666
It will then become clear whether
you need intensive therapy

738
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:29,958
or counseling.

739
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:32,916
Whether you need an analyst
or a psychiatrist.

740
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,458
It's quite simple, actually.
- It's very simple?

741
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:38,333
What are they talking?
I don't understand anything.

742
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,666
Hush! I'm sleepy. Keep quiet. - <i>So,
how do we decide which type of doctor</i>

743
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,208
<i>we should go to?</i>

744
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,125
<i>A psychiatrist or a psychologist?</i>

745
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:46,958
Each model has its own
strengths and weaknesses.

746
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,666
An individual may find one approach
more appropriate than the other

747
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,041
depending on his personal preferences

748
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,833
and the depth and severity
of the problem presented.

749
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,875
If I hear another minute of this

750
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,583
I'll go crazy!

751
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:02,125
This question is for Dr. Khan.

752
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:06,208
Dr. Khan, how do you know
if someone is crazy or normal?

753
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,750
What?
- Take me for example.

754
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:12,708
Many of you might think that I'm crazy.

755
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:17,625
Because I've come for this formal seminar
in torn jeans.

756
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:21,208
So, am I crazy? May be.

757
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:24,416
Or maybe, all I need is a good stylist.

758
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,750
Actually, crazy is a very scary word!

759
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:32,125
Because here, we still believe

760
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:35,541
that a problem of the mind
is something to be ashamed of.

761
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,041
If you have a problem
with your body, that's normal.

762
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,083
You know.. You can tell everyone.

763
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:42,500
<i>Hey, guys! I'm in hospital!</i>

764
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,833
<i>With a kidney failure</i>

765
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,166
<i>lung infection, jaundice..</i>

766
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:50,333
But if it's a problem of the mind

767
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:53,750
then the whole family goes silent.

768
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,791
Hush!

769
00:48:56,125 --> 00:49:00,375
Then they start murmuring things

770
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:05,000
as if the mind is not even
a part of the body.

771
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,583
Don't laugh just yet.

772
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,000
The joke begins now.

773
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:14,125
Here in Goa, my parents
used to tell everyone

774
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:18,416
that I'm a gynecologist,
not a psychologist.

775
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:22,083
Which means, the doctor's
own family is ashamed

776
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,458
to admit that their son
is a therapist, a brain doctor.

777
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:27,458
Imagine my plight!

778
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:31,791
Many of my pregnant relatives
landed up at my clinic

779
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:34,791
for a free check-up.

780
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:39,375
And you know what?
I have delivered a few babies too

781
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,458
for the extra pocket money.
No..

782
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:44,250
I'm just kidding you.

783
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,500
Thank you, Mr. Khan.
- Thank you.

784
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,041
Dr. Jehangir Khan.

785
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:54,500
Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

786
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:55,666
Thank you.
- It was a pleasure meeting you.

787
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,333
Very nice meeting you!
- Thank you.

788
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,166
Oh! Thank you.

789
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,666
Will you close it, please?

790
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:55,708
So, I'm Jehangir Khan.

791
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,333
But you can call me Jug.

792
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,333
May I have a glass of water?
- Yes, of course.

793
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,833
From that jug, Jug..

794
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,208
I'm sure you can crack
better jokes, Kaira.

795
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:13,791
May I call you Kaira?
- I have only one name.

796
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:22,958
So, how does this work?

797
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:27,666
I have no idea how this works.

798
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,000
You tell me.

799
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,500
Can I lie down here?

800
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:37,041
Are you sleepy?
- I'm not able to sleep since weeks.

801
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,791
That's the reason I am here.

802
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:42,208
Did you see a doctor?

803
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,750
Isn't that what I'm doing?

804
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:48,916
You mean, the white coat,
stethoscope, prescribing doctors..

805
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,125
I tried pills, they didn't work.

806
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,583
That's why I'm here.

807
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:58,416
Sometimes, I use this to knock
my patients off to sleep.

808
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:00,875
You're funny.

809
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:03,041
But you need to work on your jokes.

810
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,416
So, tell me.

811
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,750
Any major change in your life?
Or an issue?

812
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:17,416
I just moved from Mumbai to Goa, recently.
Is that a major change?

813
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,666
Yes, that's a major change. What else?

814
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:24,500
And.. Nothing.
The moving out, the settling in..

815
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:28,833
Or the leaving, the unsettling?

816
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,208
No?
- No, that's not a problem for me.

817
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,708
I like to move.
You know, not being in one place.

818
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:36,708
I like travelling.
In fact, I love to travel.

819
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,541
It's just this sleeping problem.

820
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:42,958
So, why did you move from Mumbai to Goa?

821
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,500
You know, I..

822
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:58,916
I came to Goa to be with my best friend.
I came to be with her. - Okay.

823
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,416
She's having issues with this guy.

824
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:04,000
And..

825
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:07,625
Basically, she really likes this guy..

826
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,541
I-I mean, she used to like him.

827
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:13,625
And she thought..
She thought, he liked her too

828
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,833
but then he suddenly
got engaged to someone else.

829
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,625
So, your best friend..
Is she okay now?

830
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,500
I don't.. I don't think so.

831
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't think she is okay.

832
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,541
I think her main problem
is her profession.

833
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:32,291
She has this dream job
which is linked to him.

834
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:36,291
And that guy's fiancee
will also be on this project.

835
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,750
So, how will she be able
to handle all of that?

836
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:42,000
I don't know.
What if everything gets messed up?

837
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:44,833
I don't know what to advise her.

838
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,958
Should she just deal with it?

839
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,458
I mean, it is her dream job after all.
Sometimes, I feel I should tell her

840
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,333
<i>Grit your teeth and just do it.</i>

841
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,625
<i>You won't get
another opportunity like this.</i>

842
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,541
<i>Just do it, no matter how difficult it is.</i>

843
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,541
And sometimes I feel I should say,
<i>Shut up! And say no!</i>

844
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:00,958
<i>Don't you have self-respect?</i>

845
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:04,625
So, I don't know what to tell her.

846
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,791
So, you are not able to sleep
because you are up all night

847
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:14,791
wondering whether to tell your best friend
to shut up or not?

848
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,833
My grandfather used to tell me a story.

849
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,166
Please narrate it to your best friend.

850
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,625
My grandfather was a mountain climber.

851
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:34,583
Before any expedition,
he would be thoroughly prepared.

852
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:39,166
Sadly, poor Mr. Pyarelal
was not like that.

853
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,041
Who is Mr. Pyarelal?

854
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:46,041
A very old friend of my grandfather.

855
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,250
He was also
a mountain-climbing enthusiast

856
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:51,958
whose life-long desire
was to climb the toughest peak.

857
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:54,500
Mt. Everest! Directly..

858
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,583
Finally one day, Mr. Pyarelal got
the chance to climb Mt. Everest

859
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,625
with a Chinese trekking expedition group.

860
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:06,333
Without deliberation or preparation,
he said yes and left.

861
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,708
But the group was Chinese

862
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:11,208
so they could speak
only in their own language.

863
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,791
No English.

864
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,625
So, the trek began.

865
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,583
Slowly and steadily,
the group climbed higher.

866
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,916
But Mr. Pyarelal paced ahead.

867
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:29,000
He walked ahead of the group

868
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,708
while the Chinese kept waving
from behind and shouting in Chinese.

869
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:35,250
<i>Don't go ahead!
Stop! Stop!</i>

870
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:39,416
But Mr. Pyarelal thought
they were cheering him on and went ahead

871
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:43,166
while they kept asking him to come back.

872
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:44,625
You can speak Chinese?

873
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,750
Can you?
- No.

874
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:48,083
Then, this works.

875
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,583
Don't laugh, listen.

876
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,583
Suddenly, Mr. Pyarelal saw
a growling snow leopard

877
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:53,958
in front of him.

878
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:58,666
Mr. Pyarelal got extremely scared!

879
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:01,083
Now he started waving his hands
frantically and shouted for help.

880
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,500
But the Chinese thought,
he is just happy

881
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,916
because he was much ahead of them.

882
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:07,291
So, he kept crying for help

883
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:11,375
and the Chinese kept waving back.
<i>Great..</i>

884
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:12,958
Then?

885
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,625
Then, the snow leopard
ate up poor Mr. Pyarelal.

886
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,375
What!
- Yes, he was hungry.

887
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,000
You don't find many people
on Mt. Everest.

888
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:21,708
And the group kept shouting

889
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,583
<i>Don't go ahead.</i>

890
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:28,958
What a strange story!
- No..

891
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:30,208
It's not a strange story.

892
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,791
Please tell your friend

893
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:37,083
that sometimes, we choose
the tough path only because

894
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:40,125
we feel that to achieve important things

895
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,041
we have to take the tough path.

896
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:46,958
We feel, we need to punish ourselves.

897
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,083
But why?

898
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,291
Why not choose the easy way out?
What is so bad about it?

899
00:56:56,416 --> 00:57:00,416
Especially, when we are unprepared
for the tough path.

900
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:07,125
Why climb mountains
when you are not ready for it?

901
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,708
Excuse me.

902
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:13,875
You will tell your friend
the story, right?

903
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:16,750
It's.. It's important.

904
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,958
Okay! I think..

905
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:32,333
My sleeping problem began

906
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:36,041
when Raghuvendra got engaged.

907
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,166
R-Raghuvendra?

908
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:42,166
The guy in my story.
- Right, your friend's..

909
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:45,000
No.. Mine.

910
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,291
At least, I thought he was mine.

911
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:57,583
Anyway..
Yes, we used to work together.

912
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:00,291
And when people work together..

913
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:05,500
Jack!
- Hi!

914
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,791
What are you doing here?

915
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:12,500
What are you doing here?

916
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,833
You don't answer my calls,
you moved here without telling me.

917
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,000
Without telling you?

918
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,541
Why would I tell you?
Who are you?

919
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,250
Actually, I have one thing to tell you.

920
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,666
I've made my decision.

921
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,750
W-What decision?

922
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:33,916
Kaira, I have to talk to you..
- Hush!

923
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,458
Just shut up, one second.

924
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:38,833
Listen to this story.

925
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:42,083
This man wanted to climb Mt. Everest.

926
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:45,500
But he leaves for the expedition
without any preparation.

927
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,125
He goes with Chinese companions

928
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:50,291
and when he's about to fall..

929
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:51,625
The Chinese don't understand!

930
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,000
Obviously, because they are Chinese.

931
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,375
And they keep waving their flag.

932
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:57,083
The man is stuck and then,
a tiger eats him up!

933
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,750
Got it?

934
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,791
The difficult option
is not the only option.

935
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:12,291
We can choose the easy option as well
because that would be easy.

936
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,291
You know.. Forget it.

937
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,125
It's too much for your small mind.

938
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,416
It's a very deep thought.

939
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:26,541
Are you talking about working on the film?

940
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,791
I was talking about
not working on the film!

941
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:31,250
That's my decision.

942
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:34,750
Okay. Okay, good.
- Good?

943
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,583
Yes, I think that's the best..
- You think?

944
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:40,791
Did you hear that?

945
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:41,916
You think?

946
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:45,250
I have already taken the decision

947
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,833
to not work on your film.

948
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:51,416
What do you mean by <i>you think</i>?
What do you mean by that?

949
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:55,625
I guess, someone really needs a therapy.

950
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,916
You told him?
- No, Koko..

951
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:02,250
Him?
- Yes, she told me! So what?

952
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:05,291
And anyway, why do you need therapy?

953
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,250
What's the big tragedy in your life?

954
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,250
You didn't want to get serious,
didn't want to commit.

955
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:14,500
So, I don't understand.
What is the problem?

956
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:15,958
You don't understand?
- No!

957
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:17,250
Then, get out!

958
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:20,083
Oh, God! Kaira..

959
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,833
You really need to grow up.

960
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:30,250
Good thing you've decided

961
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:32,583
not to work on my film.

962
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:35,958
I'm looking for mature people
to work with me.

963
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:39,125
What did I just say?

964
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:43,750
Get out, right?
Get out, okay!

965
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,791
Yes. You..
- Bye. See you, Jackie.

966
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:51,166
I'm not mature enough
to handle your big project

967
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,458
but mature enough
to sleep with you, right?

968
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,541
Amazing! What a revelation!

969
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,083
Kaira, I came here to..
- Just get out!

970
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:59,666
I don't want to do this, get out.
- I came here to..

971
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:02,916
What.. What are you doing, Kaira?
Kaira.. - Just get out!

972
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:13,666
Koko, are you sure about this?

973
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,375
I know, with all these personal issues

974
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,666
working with Raghu will be tough

975
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,333
but this was your big break.

976
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,541
Okay, Jack..

977
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:31,333
Sometimes, we choose
a tough path just because

978
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,250
we believe that to achieve
important things

979
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,416
we have to choose
the tough option, right?

980
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:39,958
But sometimes

981
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:43,166
you need to choose the easier option

982
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:49,333
because at that time,
that is the best option for you.

983
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:51,583
Right?

984
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,916
Especially, when you are not
ready to face that tough path.

985
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:02,208
Darn! I wish I had said it right
when he was here.

986
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,500
You want some tea?

987
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:27,625
<i>Tonight, I'm going to sleep so well.
So well!</i>

988
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:33,416
<i>Very well!</i>

989
01:03:57,791 --> 01:04:00,500
I was at this construction site

990
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:03,083
with all these construction workers.

991
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,291
All short and strange people.

992
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:10,458
Suddenly, I lose my balance

993
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:13,083
and I go falling down.

994
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,833
Like.. One big fall!

995
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:18,083
And I land straight in muck.

996
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,666
I think, it was a gutter.

997
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:26,916
All these workers are just staring,
but no one is helping me.

998
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,291
I look up

999
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,166
and I see my camera dangling

1000
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:37,708
and then suddenly, out of nowhere

1001
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,083
this group of newly married women

1002
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,333
in saris

1003
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:46,416
who are all decked-up, come there.

1004
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,041
They are looking at me,
they start pointing at me

1005
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:52,166
and they're just laughing at me.

1006
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:57,208
Bam! I woke up.

1007
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,958
It was 4 a.m.
I went and stood under the shower.

1008
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:03,791
Why shower?

1009
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:06,791
I don't know.

1010
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:11,708
I felt dirty,
I felt like I needed to clean up.

1011
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,666
So, this Raghuvendra,
is he tall and handsome?

1012
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,041
That's your conclusion of my dream?

1013
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,708
Just asking.

1014
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,458
You know what I felt?

1015
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:31,166
I felt, I am ugly.

1016
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,916
That I'm disgusting, cheap, dirty..

1017
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:37,208
That's funny.
- What's funny?

1018
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:39,250
I mean..

1019
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,625
All this from a girl who is

1020
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:46,541
the opposite of ugly,
disgusting or dirty.

1021
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:51,333
That's funny. It's not
a hilarious joke, though. I mean..

1022
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,291
Okay.

1023
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:56,541
Oops!

1024
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,125
What's with this?

1025
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:03,125
It only creaks when you really like
someone, but can't do anything about it.

1026
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:14,291
Yes, Raghuvendra is tall and handsome.

1027
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:19,416
So, you like tall people,
not short and strange.

1028
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,666
Maybe! Sid was also tall.

1029
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:25,708
So, there's a Sid too?

1030
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:26,875
Yes, so?

1031
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:31,583
So, I mean, you're a young
and beautiful woman.

1032
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,958
You must have admirers.
- What do you mean?

1033
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:35,458
What do you mean by admirers?

1034
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,625
I mean, you're a young
and beautiful woman.

1035
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:39,333
You must surely have admirers.
- Admirers?

1036
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,083
Yes. - You're trying to say
that there are lots of men!

1037
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,875
That's what you're trying to say.
Just say it. - No..

1038
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,208
What do you want me to say?
- That I am a terrible woman!

1039
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Why would I say that? No!

1040
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:46,708
That's what you are saying.

1041
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:49,875
You actually mean
that I'm a fast girl, a cheap girl.

1042
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:51,250
No! Come on!

1043
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:54,333
Fast, dirty, cheap..
Why are you using such words?

1044
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:57,250
Why use these words? No..
- Isn't that what the world thinks?

1045
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:58,416
No, come on! Seriously!

1046
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:02,083
If a girl has more than
one relationship, then that's it.

1047
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:03,416
That is what you are labeled.

1048
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:28,958
Kaira.

1049
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:32,375
Have you ever bought a chair?

1050
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,666
What?
- A chair, have you ever bought one?

1051
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:37,333
Yes.

1052
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,916
And did you just go into a shop
and buy the first chair you saw?

1053
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,541
No.
- Exactly my point!

1054
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:49,250
We check and try so many different chairs
until we find the right one.

1055
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:53,583
And yes, some chairs may be comfortable
but look terrible.

1056
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,000
Others look nice, but doesn't
give you the comfort you expect!

1057
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:57,583
So, the process starts..

1058
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:01,166
Chair after chair and it goes on..

1059
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:03,791
We check out so many chairs
before we find

1060
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:05,500
that one chair!

1061
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:12,208
That..
- It doesn't creak when I sit.

1062
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:14,458
So, my point being

1063
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:19,541
if we look for so many options
just to buy a chair

1064
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,916
then shouldn't we look at options

1065
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,291
when choosing a life partner?

1066
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,375
So, dirty, cheap, fast.. No!

1067
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:33,500
Smart, clear, fine..
Actually, super-fine!

1068
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:35,958
Okay, wait..

1069
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:40,208
So, those married women in my dream
who believe

1070
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:43,666
that marriage is the only
acceptable relationship..

1071
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,000
I felt dirty because of them.

1072
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:51,166
See? You figured it out yourself.
You don't need anyone's help.

1073
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:55,791
But my dangling camera?
What does that mean?

1074
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,791
Just like my future,
it's hanging in the air.

1075
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,875
Well, you know what?
You should sit on my chair.

1076
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,833
And I should sit here from today.

1077
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:11,000
It's so cool.

1078
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:15,375
I wish the whole world could
hear about your chair theory.

1079
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,458
At least they could know of it.

1080
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:21,791
Why is it important
for the whole world to know this?

1081
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,458
No, I just..

1082
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:29,541
If they all understand this chair theory,
they will stop judging others

1083
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,458
and what a beautiful world it will be!

1084
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,333
No, Kaira.

1085
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,625
When you understand yourself well

1086
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,416
then what others think of you
doesn't matter.

1087
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,000
Not at all.

1088
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:45,291
If you don't take charge

1089
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,916
of your own life,
then somebody else will!

1090
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:56,000
I pity those who don't shop for chairs.

1091
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:02,541
Kaira, will you go back
to your chair, please?

1092
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,958
Come on.
- Okay..

1093
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:06,666
Seemed like you wanted
to take my chair home with you.

1094
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:08,083
And speaking of home, I remembered..

1095
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:12,333
I have homework for you.
- Homework?

1096
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,458
Yes, I'm very strict with my
homework assignments. - Okay.

1097
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:18,333
I want you to chat with your parents.
- What!

1098
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:20,250
At least 10 minutes with each, please.

1099
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,083
Please, what will I talk about with them?

1100
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:23,583
Time's up. See you next week.

1101
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,166
What! We have 20 seconds more.

1102
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:31,625
Hey, you saw that?
Here, look here.. Look..

1103
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,250
What happened?

1104
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,666
Twenty seconds happened!

1105
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,541
I don't like this buzzer.
- Okay.

1106
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:42,708
Homework, Kaira!

1107
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:43,875
Yes!

1108
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,750
Hey, those are really
nice looking glasses.

1109
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:50,083
Thanks.

1110
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,583
Are you going to see Jug?

1111
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,166
Yes, I have an appointment.

1112
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,375
Really?

1113
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,833
You have problems too?

1114
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,500
Yes.

1115
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,958
I am going to repair my cycle.

1116
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,125
He repairs cycles too?

1117
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:11,208
Hi, Dad.
- Hi, darling.

1118
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,458
When are you coming home?
- I'll come..

1119
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:16,333
You will be home
before Kiddo arrives, right?

1120
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:19,083
There's enough time for that.
Of course, I'll be there.

1121
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,083
Your mom is in high spirits.

1122
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,125
She's busy making preparations
for the party!

1123
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:26,041
Obviously, since her prince is coming.

1124
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:30,666
The restaurant management loved your film.

1125
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,750
They said that it was very well shot.

1126
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,333
Oh, the hotel video!

1127
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,291
Close up of <i>Prawn Balchao</i>?
- Yes..

1128
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,416
Anyway, I'll call later.

1129
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:40,666
Okay, dear. Bye.

1130
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:41,875
Bye.

1131
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,791
Just four minutes.

1132
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:51,541
Yes, Koko, you called?

1133
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:54,000
Yes, why didn't you pick up?
- I was getting Kiddo's room cleaned.

1134
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,250
Shift that!

1135
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,583
Sorry, I didn't have my phone with me.

1136
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,750
Okay, but I'm busy now.
I can't talk. So, bye..

1137
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:01,333
Okay.

1138
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:03,750
Shift that!

1139
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:07,500
<i>Talk to mom and dad for 10 minutes?
Is he crazy!</i>

1140
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:20,791
Beach?

1141
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,208
Are we having the session out here today?

1142
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:36,250
Why not! Any problem?

1143
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,875
I don't have a problem.
But is it allowed?

1144
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,500
Whose permission do I need?

1145
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:45,791
I don't know, but aren't there some rules?

1146
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:49,708
Like privacy, closed door,
couch and all that?

1147
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,583
There are rules.

1148
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:54,583
But one should know which ones
to break and which ones not to.

1149
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:00,416
Now, people will know I am crazy.

1150
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:04,708
Who are these people
who keep following you?

1151
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:16,291
You know, despite the mess,
Goa is the most beautiful place in India.

1152
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:19,375
I wish I could agree.

1153
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:22,666
Why? You don't like Goa?

1154
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,541
I was born here.

1155
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:29,208
This is where my parents live.
How can I like it?

1156
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:33,833
Did you do your homework?

1157
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,500
Only half.

1158
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,500
I managed to talk to dad
for only five minutes.

1159
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:42,750
Okay, four minutes!
But that's a record in itself.

1160
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:45,416
Wow! And what about your mom?

1161
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:47,791
I tried, but she was busy.

1162
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:51,125
So, you've only done a quarter.

1163
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,541
Anyway, what did you talk about
with your dad?

1164
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,416
About Kiddo, my brother.

1165
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,458
He's studying in London University.

1166
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:04,291
He's coming home soon,
so my parents are hosting a big party

1167
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,958
for his homecoming.

1168
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,833
When I got here, nobody even said <i>welcome</i>.

1169
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:12,666
So, you don't like Kiddo?

1170
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:17,083
No.. I love Kiddo. I really do!

1171
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:20,416
He's the only one who can make me smile.

1172
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:23,083
Just by being there

1173
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,125
he makes me happy!

1174
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:31,500
When he was little,
I read him his favorite comic.

1175
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,500
You know<i> Tinkle</i>?
Have you read it?

1176
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:38,166
Yes. <i>Shikari Shambhu</i>,
<i>Kaalia, the Crow</i>.. - Yes..

1177
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,583
And <i>Supandi</i>..
- <i>Supandi</i>! Exactly!

1178
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,916
Oh, God!
So, <i>Supandi</i> was Kiddo's favorite.

1179
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:48,166
So, I would replace Supandi's name
with Kiddo's name

1180
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:49,750
and read it to him.

1181
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,500
He loved hearing the story in my voice.

1182
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:57,500
Even today, he says
it's his best childhood memory.

1183
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:00,500
What is your best childhood memory?

1184
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,000
Come on, there must be something.

1185
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,291
I don't know.

1186
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,416
What are the best memories
of your childhood?

1187
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:23,750
My dad used to bring me here every Sunday

1188
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,916
to play <i>kabaddi</i> with the sea.

1189
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,041
<i>Kabaddi</i> with the sea?

1190
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,125
Come..

1191
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:43,708
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

1192
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,208
Go back!

1193
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,333
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!
- Okay..

1194
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:50,583
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

1195
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:52,125
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..

1196
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,375
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!
- Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

1197
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,541
Kabaddi..
- Run!

1198
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,541
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

1199
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:01,416
Kabaddi..
- Come on!

1200
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:05,583
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!
- Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

1201
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,541
Kabaddi..
- Come on!

1202
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,583
Kabaddi.. Just two more.

1203
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,250
Okay.
- Just one second.

1204
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:16,708
Come on, big one. Kabaddi!
- Kabaddi..

1205
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:25,791
I can.. I can do this all day long!

1206
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:31,875
It's important that parents create
happy memories for their children.

1207
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:34,958
Now, I am a parent myself.

1208
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:39,208
So, I'm hoping

1209
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:43,875
that my son has
at least some good memories

1210
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,166
to tell his therapist.

1211
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,416
He stays with his mom.

1212
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,541
In divorce cases, kids usually
end up with the mother.

1213
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,333
I just regret

1214
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:10,833
not being able to spend
enough time with him.

1215
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:22,958
I remember Shyra.

1216
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,500
My doll.

1217
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,625
My dad's birthday gift to me.

1218
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:36,541
When I was living with my grandparents,
Shyra was with me.

1219
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:41,708
I never played with her

1220
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:44,875
but just kept her close to me, you know..

1221
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:47,125
At night

1222
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:51,875
I would hug her tightly and sleep.

1223
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,208
Were you shy?

1224
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,125
Yes.

1225
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:12,708
How did you know?
- You know..

1226
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,041
Shyra starts with <i>shy</i>.
I-I'm a genius, really!

1227
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:19,291
When I was little, I was shy.

1228
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:22,041
Dad used to call me Kaira-Shyra.

1229
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,041
But now, I'm fully Kaira.

1230
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:26,125
Kaira-Shyra..
Now, fully Kaira..

1231
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:27,250
Yes.

1232
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:31,666
Are you sure?

1233
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:37,666
Come on.

1234
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,708
Listen.. Just a second.
Tell me something.

1235
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:47,208
Why did you ask me to talk
to mom and dad for 10 minutes?

1236
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:50,625
Is there some Chinese
mountain climbing story behind this?

1237
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:54,458
Someday, you'll have
to climb Mt. Everest, right?

1238
01:19:24,416 --> 01:19:25,458
Where is Shyra?

1239
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:27,458
Shyra who?

1240
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,041
My doll!

1241
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,500
The one dad gave me.

1242
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:33,250
How come you thought of that doll
all of a sudden?

1243
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,500
Do you know where she is or not?

1244
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:35,666
She may be in the storeroom

1245
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:38,333
along with your and Kiddo's old things.

1246
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,416
What do you mean by may be?

1247
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:42,333
She must be there somewhere.

1248
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,000
How will I remember after all these years?

1249
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:50,125
Do you remember anything at all
about those years?

1250
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,125
Taste this Bibik.

1251
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,666
What is Bibik now?

1252
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,333
Bebinca! I just made it.
It's Kiddo's favorite.

1253
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,791
No, I'm leaving.

1254
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,333
I'm making Coconut Laddus for you.

1255
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:04,541
Your favorite!

1256
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,041
I remember.

1257
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,250
You just want to make me fat!

1258
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,958
Coconut Laddus!

1259
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:19,666
I feel like breaking a coconut
on everyone's head.

1260
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:24,791
No! No violence.
Do deep breathing.

1261
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:27,916
What memories will parents
leave behind for us

1262
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,666
when they can't remember
anything themselves?

1263
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:33,583
Let's drink to Shyra, wherever she is.

1264
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,958
"I can see the moon from my street."

1265
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,333
"It's the one we celebrate with."

1266
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:01,208
"Is that you?"

1267
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,750
"My mom"

1268
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:07,291
"has made me a suit"

1269
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:09,541
"with the dream of finding
a beautiful woman."

1270
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:11,583
"Is that you?"

1271
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:16,333
"Who is it, for whom my heart
doesn't listen to me?"

1272
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,375
"It's you."

1273
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:26,583
"Who is it, for whom my heart
is protecting itself for someone?"

1274
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:28,125
"It's you."

1275
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,958
"Who is that so far away?"

1276
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:41,916
"Who is that so close?"

1277
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:46,958
"Who is that so special?"

1278
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:48,958
"It's you."

1279
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:11,041
"The one for whom"

1280
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:15,833
"I'd break all other hearts."

1281
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:18,666
"Is it you?"

1282
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,333
"The one for whom"

1283
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,833
"I'd go on living."

1284
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:26,083
"I'd insure my love!"

1285
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:28,333
"Is it you?"

1286
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,958
"The one, who's presence
makes everything come alive."

1287
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:32,916
"Who is it?"

1288
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:34,958
"It's you."

1289
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:43,166
"Who is that so far away?"

1290
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:48,250
"Who is that so close?"

1291
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:53,250
"Who is that so special?"

1292
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:55,000
"It's you."

1293
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:03,333
"Who is mentioned in my verses?"

1294
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:08,708
"Who is in my poetry?"

1295
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:13,208
"Who is in my diary?

1296
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:16,750
"It's you."

1297
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,708
Thank you..

1298
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,208
Hi!

1299
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:29,666
Oh, hello.

1300
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:31,625
That was a beautiful song.

1301
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,416
I mean, you have a beautiful voice.

1302
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:36,500
Yes! You totally rocked it.

1303
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:40,291
If your audience is so rocking,
the song has to match up.

1304
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:45,250
I am Jackie and this is Kaira.

1305
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:48,125
Hi, Jackie.
Hi, Kaira.

1306
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:50,041
And you are?

1307
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:52,250
Rumi.

1308
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:53,708
Rumi?
- Rumi.

1309
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:56,375
Okay.
- Girls night out?

1310
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,291
Yes. They are the best nights.
- They are the best nights..

1311
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:03,291
Hey, great song!
- Thanks!

1312
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:05,750
You killed it!
- Did I?

1313
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:08,916
Killed who? We're all alive here.

1314
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:12,708
Girls night, don't mind.
Cheers!

1315
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:14,291
You have a lovely voice!
- Thank you.

1316
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,208
You should be singing in films.

1317
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:18,083
Films! Why only in films?

1318
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:21,375
I should sing everywhere.
There are all kinds of music.

1319
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:26,833
There is rock, pop, jazz, blues..

1320
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:30,583
Do you like blues?

1321
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,875
Blues?

1322
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:35,791
You seem more red to me.

1323
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:39,583
What?

1324
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,833
<i>Vorresti fuggire con me?</i>

1325
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:47,583
That was Greek to me.

1326
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:48,958
It's Italian, actually.

1327
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:52,916
Does that mean that I'm
so beautiful and gorgeous

1328
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,166
that you can't take your eyes off me?

1329
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:55,791
Not at all.

1330
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:59,500
It means that I'm
heading to a private beach

1331
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:02,083
with some of my friends
to play some music.

1332
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:05,791
Would you like to run away with me?

1333
01:25:19,791 --> 01:25:21,083
Not bad.

1334
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:17,875
Wow!

1335
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:19,833
Somebody seems to be
in a musical mood today.

1336
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:28,041
"Who is it, for whom my heart
doesn't listen to me? It's you."

1337
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:30,333
Excuse me?

1338
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:38,958
"Last night, I went out
to listen to a band."

1339
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:45,375
"Which band was it?
Where did you go?"

1340
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:48,958
"The name of the band..
I don't know."

1341
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:50,708
"But the singer, I know."

1342
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:55,750
"So, tell me more..
Tell me more!"

1343
01:26:56,958 --> 01:27:00,208
We didn't talk, there was only music!

1344
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,083
What do I tell?
- Yes.

1345
01:27:02,791 --> 01:27:04,750
So, what was his name? Banjo?

1346
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:07,750
Or the fellow was called Cello?

1347
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,625
Rumi.
- Wow!

1348
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,166
He's new.. My new chair.

1349
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:17,083
So, comfortable?
- What?

1350
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:19,291
Is the new chair comfortable?

1351
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:23,625
Yes, but it's a musical chair.

1352
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:25,708
I will have to listen to music all day.

1353
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:26,833
How to listen?

1354
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:30,833
Well, why didn't you tell him straight
that you like dialogues too?

1355
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:34,416
How can you ask a musician
to stop the music and talk?

1356
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:37,083
He'll think, I'm an illiterate
when it comes to music.

1357
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,250
Have you ever felt like an illiterate?

1358
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:40,500
Yes.

1359
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,625
I've sat through
a three-hour Italian opera.

1360
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:46,041
I pretended as if it touched my heart

1361
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:49,541
when every minute was a torture.

1362
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:53,208
I wanted to stand up on the chair
and scream even louder than them

1363
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:55,166
that I'm an illiterate
when it comes to opera.

1364
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,833
Really.
- Wow, okay!

1365
01:28:02,166 --> 01:28:05,166
What would you do if you were
dating an opera singer?

1366
01:28:05,291 --> 01:28:07,333
I would tell her,
<i>I will do anything for you</i>

1367
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:09,500
<i>but don't make me hear the opera.</i>

1368
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:12,166
That would be the end.
She would dump you and run away.

1369
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:15,458
After six months of suffering,
I would have, anyway, run away.

1370
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,416
If one is going to suffer

1371
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:19,375
the other person should at least know.

1372
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,375
What is the point of suffering in silence?

1373
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:25,166
There isn't any.

1374
01:28:26,041 --> 01:28:27,083
See, when you..

1375
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:31,708
I'm so sorry.
- I-It's okay.

1376
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:33,750
I will get a new one for you.
- I-I'll do it, don't touch it.

1377
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,708
I'll fix it, all right?
- How much did it cost?

1378
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:39,083
I think it's safer to have
our sessions outdoor.

1379
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:42,666
Come on, tell me more about Rumi.

1380
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:11,083
You know, I like people who smell nice.

1381
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:14,666
I hate smelly people.

1382
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:16,291
Really? Why?

1383
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:19,125
So, you like smelly people?

1384
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:22,291
Everyone has a different smell.

1385
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:26,458
That's how people get
attracted to each other.

1386
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:31,708
Yuck! Who goes around smelling people
to get attracted?

1387
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,416
Dogs.

1388
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:36,833
Dogs!

1389
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:40,125
Yes, dogs!

1390
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:43,875
Ganju, we should record our conversations.

1391
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:46,916
You prove to be a genius sometimes.

1392
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:48,708
Genius!
- Yes, please.

1393
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:52,916
<i>Genius is not one</i>

1394
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:56,083
<i>who has all the answers.</i>

1395
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,291
<i>Genius is one who has</i>

1396
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:04,000
<i>the patience to find every answer.</i>

1397
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:08,541
Deep..
- Which genius said this?

1398
01:30:09,083 --> 01:30:11,166
Dr. Jehangir Khan.

1399
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,958
Khan!

1400
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:15,166
So, does he smell nice?

1401
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:16,583
Who?

1402
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:21,916
There you go.

1403
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:26,375
Wait.. Let it breathe. Cheers!

1404
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,041
Listen to this bit.

1405
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,375
I love chocolate.

1406
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:38,958
Okay, this bit.

1407
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:49,333
Wait, one second.

1408
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,833
Pink Floyd's first album,
you have to get this.

1409
01:30:57,041 --> 01:31:03,083
"I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all."

1410
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:07,708
"I agree, you find a place.."

1411
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:10,250
You like strawberries?
- "... in every heart."

1412
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:18,541
"Yes, you are a dream.
Your every move is a charm."

1413
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:25,500
"But.. You're not one
to be wooed by flattery."

1414
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:41,125
Try some. - Can we just have
the music off, please!

1415
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,208
"My heart.."

1416
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:48,500
I'm sorry, I just need some silence.

1417
01:31:48,833 --> 01:31:49,875
It's okay.

1418
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:52,791
"What if you see.."

1419
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:57,958
Everything okay?

1420
01:31:58,541 --> 01:32:01,708
I wrote this song for you.

1421
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:04,416
But it's okay, silence is good sometimes.

1422
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:06,833
There is beauty in silence too.

1423
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:09,166
Let's be silent.

1424
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:29,416
Come here. I am sorry..

1425
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:32,708
That's not silent.

1426
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,625
I'm sorry.

1427
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:42,041
Okay, play your song.

1428
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:43,958
No, forget my song.

1429
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:45,833
Let's talk about you.

1430
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:47,875
I want to know everything about you.

1431
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:51,375
What?
- Come, sit.

1432
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,708
Tell me about yourself.

1433
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,750
What was your first film about?

1434
01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:00,708
When did you decide to be a camerawoman?

1435
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:01,916
What's your journey?

1436
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:07,250
You know, I haven't even
shot a selfie in my life.

1437
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:09,958
Isn't that funny?
So, tell me.

1438
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:11,791
I want to know about your dreams

1439
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:14,500
your inspirations, your aspirations..

1440
01:33:14,666 --> 01:33:16,458
I want to know everything about you.

1441
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:18,333
You!

1442
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:22,250
What?
- What?

1443
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,666
What's going on?

1444
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,166
Shall I put on some music?

1445
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,666
Please!

1446
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:47,166
I've heard enough for a lifetime.

1447
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:52,166
So, still suffering silently?
Or did you say it?

1448
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:54,041
I yelled it!

1449
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:55,208
So, he ran away?

1450
01:33:55,333 --> 01:33:58,583
No, he was very sweet, actually.

1451
01:34:01,458 --> 01:34:03,791
He stopped playing the song

1452
01:34:04,666 --> 01:34:06,708
which apparently,
he had composed for me

1453
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:10,833
and began asking about me.

1454
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:15,708
I felt guilty at first but..

1455
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:26,833
Why are romantic relationships
so irritating?

1456
01:34:28,416 --> 01:34:32,541
With friends, it's all so easy.
It just flows!

1457
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:36,166
You don't need to make such an effort.

1458
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:40,208
Who are the five people closest to you?

1459
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:41,625
Your top five?

1460
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,416
Why?

1461
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:46,208
There is an important study

1462
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,125
based on the size of the human brain

1463
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:52,541
that shows that everyone has about
150 people in their whole life.

1464
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:56,166
The next cut is the 50 who
you would invite home for dinner.

1465
01:34:56,291 --> 01:35:00,583
Then, 15 people who you turn to
during your good times and bad times.

1466
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:03,041
And the final cut is of 5 people

1467
01:35:03,458 --> 01:35:05,416
who mean the world to you.

1468
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:08,458
Your inner circle..

1469
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:10,291
So..

1470
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:13,250
Who are your five people?

1471
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,791
Okay.

1472
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:21,625
Fatty, Kiddo, Jackie, Alka..

1473
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:25,333
Raghuvendra.. No!

1474
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:27,458
And I forgot to add..

1475
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:31,916
These five people
can also change with time.

1476
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:35,958
That's true, but these four people
will always be on the list.

1477
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:39,750
Okay, so think of these four and tell me

1478
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:42,583
how do you feel when you are with them

1479
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:46,208
as compared to the changing fifth person.

1480
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:51,208
How.. How do these four people
make you feel?

1481
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:55,958
Special! I feel special.

1482
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,208
I feel important.

1483
01:35:58,333 --> 01:35:59,333
I feel respected.

1484
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,666
I feel..

1485
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:04,708
I feel happy and safe.

1486
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:07,250
So, you don't feel safe
with your boyfriends?

1487
01:36:09,541 --> 01:36:11,291
It's not that.

1488
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:14,291
I feel safe but..

1489
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:20,125
I don't know..
I don't know. It's not that.

1490
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:22,708
With my friends

1491
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:29,666
I feel free, I feel like myself.

1492
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:32,208
Why safe?

1493
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:36,958
When you start liking a guy

1494
01:36:41,458 --> 01:36:43,875
what is your fear, Kaira?

1495
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:53,041
It's back in one piece.

1496
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:57,500
I believe, all broken things
can be put back together.

1497
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:18,458
<i>How is the therapist?</i>

1498
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,791
<i>Is he married or single?</i>

1499
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,958
<i>Ma'am. Here you go.
- Thank you, Alka.</i>

1500
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:23,958
Hi, Alka!

1501
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:26,375
<i>Look there.
</i>- Hi!

1502
01:37:26,791 --> 01:37:29,416
<i>Ma'am, how are you?
</i>- Hi!

1503
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:30,625
Rubbish!

1504
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:34,208
<i>Why did you go to the doctor?
Are you okay?</i>

1505
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,333
I went to a brain doctor.

1506
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:37,958
<i>What happened to your brain?</i>

1507
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:42,833
Nothing, if you have

1508
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,083
an emotional problem in your life

1509
01:37:45,208 --> 01:37:47,958
then a brain doctor can help you solve it.

1510
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,541
<i>Do such doctors exist?
</i>- Yes.

1511
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:54,291
<i>Then everyone should go to them.</i>

1512
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:56,791
Yes, everyone should.

1513
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:09,583
"I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all!"

1514
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,708
"I agree,
you find a place in every heart."

1515
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:25,791
"Yes, you're a dream.
Your every move is a charm."

1516
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:32,666
"But.. You're not one
to be wooed by flattery."

1517
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:38,958
Please play! Don't stop!

1518
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:42,916
Come on, play the music.
- Come on.. Play.

1519
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:48,291
Hey, come on, play the music!
- Come on!

1520
01:38:48,666 --> 01:38:50,708
You were amazing! Don't stop.

1521
01:38:51,333 --> 01:38:54,083
Come on!
- That's like it!

1522
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:58,958
"Be calm, my heart."

1523
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:01,708
"Don't beat so loud."

1524
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,750
"Let her not see"

1525
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:09,541
"your restlessness."

1526
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:17,208
"You will smile now at my state."

1527
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:24,250
"But.. You're not one
to be wooed by flattery."

1528
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:45,708
"Should I whisper in your ears"

1529
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:49,250
"or scream from mountain tops?"

1530
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:54,583
I'm telling you, it was good fun!

1531
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:57,666
We danced to the latest songs all night!

1532
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:58,958
What's happening?

1533
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:00,791
Fatty!

1534
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:03,916
I called you, why didn't you answer?

1535
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:05,916
<i>Hi, Koko.</i>

1536
01:40:07,791 --> 01:40:09,791
Why are you both grinning like that?

1537
01:40:09,916 --> 01:40:13,500
<i>Jackie is just telling me
about her new boyfriend.</i>

1538
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:14,791
What!

1539
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:17,416
Excuse me! What new boyfriend?

1540
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:18,625
How about telling me?

1541
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,791
I'm right here. Am I invisible?

1542
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:23,166
You didn't even ask.
- Why do I have to ask?

1543
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:25,208
<i>Okay, guys, relax! Please don't fight.
</i>- How can you not tell me?

1544
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:28,750
Oh, wait! I know why! Because it's
that weird guy from the bar, right?

1545
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:30,708
See, this is what you do.

1546
01:40:30,833 --> 01:40:32,000
You're always judging my men.
- <i>Girls!</i>

1547
01:40:32,125 --> 01:40:34,000
I'm not judging, you called him weird.
-<i> I want to..</i>

1548
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:37,458
That was then. Now I like him.
- <i>Look how big I am.</i>

1549
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:40,041
<i>Like a football. Hello.. </i>- But you didn't
tell me that you like him.

1550
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:43,041
<i>Girls!</i> - Because you never asked,
you're not around.

1551
01:40:43,166 --> 01:40:45,458
<i>Fine!</i> - How am I supposed to know
if you don't tell me?

1552
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,083
How could you do this?
- You're supposed to be around.

1553
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,250
You keep doing this
and blame me for everything.

1554
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:50,583
I am around!

1555
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:54,083
Fatty, where are you?

1556
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,125
Great! You also leave me.

1557
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:08,125
Good morning!

1558
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:11,041
Good morning, Jackie!

1559
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:15,041
Anything special today?
- Yes.

1560
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,791
You! You're so special.

1561
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:22,583
You're so special! Jackie..
- No.. My personal space!

1562
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:25,750
Okay, I'm special.

1563
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,458
So, you fix cycles too?

1564
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:39,208
I try.

1565
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:42,958
And if I can't fix them, I recycle them.

1566
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:48,416
Recycle a cycle?

1567
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:53,375
Kaira, you have to crack
better jokes, please.

1568
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:59,666
So, all that cycle art
in your room and..

1569
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:02,625
Hey! Hi, by the way!
- Hi.

1570
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:07,458
This boy was wearing those funky
looking glasses, you made all that?

1571
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:09,416
Finally, you noticed!

1572
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:11,625
He's an artist.
- Yes.

1573
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:15,291
If you can't fix people

1574
01:42:15,416 --> 01:42:18,166
then do you recycle them too?

1575
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:25,250
Bye, Jug.
- Sorry about it.

1576
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:29,541
That's so mean.
- Yes, that's so mean. Let's go.

1577
01:42:33,125 --> 01:42:34,708
Why cycle today?

1578
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,666
Just breaking the pattern.

1579
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:39,125
Yes, we should break it.

1580
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:43,625
You must be going insane
listening to crazy people like me

1581
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:46,625
all day inside one room.
- Quite possible!

1582
01:42:46,916 --> 01:42:48,166
Albert Einstein once said

1583
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:50,791
<i>An insane person is one who does
the same thing over and over again</i>

1584
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:53,041
<i>and expects different results each time.</i>

1585
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:03,833
By the way.. It's over with Rumi.
I broke up with him.

1586
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:05,208
Why?

1587
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:07,750
No.. I can't do it!

1588
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:10,333
It's too much.

1589
01:43:10,833 --> 01:43:12,833
He doesn't fit in my..

1590
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:15,791
I don't know.
I can't handle it. It's too much.

1591
01:43:16,041 --> 01:43:18,250
What's too much?
- Too much!

1592
01:43:18,416 --> 01:43:20,958
Wait.. Lance Armstrong!

1593
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:27,125
Did Rumi do something wrong?

1594
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:30,375
No, we were just wrong for each other.

1595
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:33,375
Not this chair.

1596
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:37,958
Shiver! Only happens when we feel cold

1597
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:41,666
or have a fever,
or due to the weather.

1598
01:43:42,291 --> 01:43:45,666
Sometimes people shiver
when they are scared.

1599
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:55,166
I just want to be free.

1600
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:57,791
Free from all this!
- Yes.

1601
01:43:58,125 --> 01:44:00,208
I also want you to be free!

1602
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:02,291
Free from your fears!
- Yes!

1603
01:44:02,458 --> 01:44:04,625
Free! Free..

1604
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:05,875
Oh, wow!

1605
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:10,166
Help.. Help me.

1606
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:14,208
Oh, no! Our time's up.
- What!

1607
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:15,958
Got to go! Sorry!

1608
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:18,083
Jug! Oh, my God!

1609
01:44:19,875 --> 01:44:21,750
Get my glasses, please.

1610
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:24,125
Oh, God!

1611
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:29,833
My darling boy, all good?

1612
01:44:29,958 --> 01:44:31,166
Yes, all good.

1613
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:34,500
Kiddo! Spend some time
with me now, come on.

1614
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:36,458
Sorry, I was getting ready.

1615
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:38,500
You know, it's my party.
I have to look nice.

1616
01:44:38,666 --> 01:44:39,833
You look nice.

1617
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:42,750
Listen. Are you also
a part of this matchmaking?

1618
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:44,250
Me?
- Yes, you.

1619
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:48,291
I have no clue
but I want to see the fun. - Dear..

1620
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,708
Sweet boy Kiddo!

1621
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,000
And you,
is your best friend, Jackie, here?

1622
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:59,250
Is she still single or..

1623
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:02,041
Yes, she's still very much single
and so is Kaira.

1624
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:05,208
Sweet boy Kiddo!

1625
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:07,333
Please stop, it's starting to hurt.

1626
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,458
Kaira, come.. Come.

1627
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:11,041
Bye. - Bye.
- Come on.

1628
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:15,750
I want to introduce you
to a young man.

1629
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:18,500
This is my niece, Kaira.

1630
01:45:18,666 --> 01:45:20,541
Hi, Kaira. I'm Suresh.

1631
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:21,833
Suresh.
- Yes.

1632
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:23,166
Pleasure.

1633
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:26,208
Well, I'll see you all later.
- Alright, cheers, sir.

1634
01:45:26,791 --> 01:45:28,250
Cheers.
- Yeah.

1635
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:33,958
So, you're a photographer, right?

1636
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:36,666
Cinematographer, actually.

1637
01:45:36,791 --> 01:45:39,291
One and the same thing.
- No, it's not the same thing.

1638
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:40,958
It's not? Okay.
- No!

1639
01:45:42,125 --> 01:45:43,458
What do you do?

1640
01:45:43,958 --> 01:45:45,166
I'm a techie.

1641
01:45:47,125 --> 01:45:49,166
Does that sound boring?

1642
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:52,666
Fun.
- It's fun? Then, cheers!

1643
01:45:54,208 --> 01:45:57,375
So, what do you think..

1644
01:45:57,916 --> 01:45:59,708
Why should I be interested in you?

1645
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:05,041
That was pretty direct, right?

1646
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,875
But I can be interesting

1647
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:13,250
if I meet an interesting girl.

1648
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:15,750
It depends.

1649
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,541
Okay..
- Yes.

1650
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:23,458
Kiddo, your favorite food. Eat, dear.
- Thank you.

1651
01:46:23,666 --> 01:46:25,500
What a lovely child Kiddo was!

1652
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:28,166
He never used to cry.
- Right!

1653
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:30,291
Sweet boy!

1654
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:33,958
He would never leave my side,
and always called out to me!

1655
01:46:34,291 --> 01:46:36,500
Well, I figured, calling out to you

1656
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:40,875
was a better way to get
what I wanted, than to cry.

1657
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:44,458
These kids grow up so fast!
- I know!

1658
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:48,333
Look at Kiddo. He has achieved
so much at a young age!

1659
01:46:48,791 --> 01:46:51,916
He has got a scholarship
for a higher degree. - Is it?

1660
01:46:52,125 --> 01:46:55,041
Yes! Then, an internship with a big firm.

1661
01:46:55,166 --> 01:46:56,666
Tell them the name
of the company, Kiddo.

1662
01:46:56,833 --> 01:46:59,958
Dad, just stop it now.

1663
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,333
You are doing the right thing!

1664
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:05,833
You are doing the correct thing!

1665
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:10,666
You're not eating anything.

1666
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:12,583
Are you dieting again?

1667
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:14,333
I don't feel like.

1668
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,708
Eat something at least.

1669
01:47:17,291 --> 01:47:19,208
Fine, give it to me.

1670
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:20,875
Here, have this.

1671
01:47:21,583 --> 01:47:25,708
You remember, Chanda?
Kiddo was such a gentle, quiet boy.

1672
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,166
But Kaira, a real firecracker.

1673
01:47:29,291 --> 01:47:31,250
She's still the same.

1674
01:47:31,458 --> 01:47:32,958
Firecracker is the apt word for her.

1675
01:47:33,083 --> 01:47:37,583
Anger, tantrums and sulking,
most of all with me.

1676
01:47:37,875 --> 01:47:42,125
You kids have no idea
how tough it is to be a parent.

1677
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:46,666
And it's never ending.
There is no end to it.

1678
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:49,833
Once a parent, always a parent.
- I agree.

1679
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:52,000
No holiday from this job.
Right, Ashu? - Yes!

1680
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:54,083
All parents should be felicitated
with a national award.

1681
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:56,208
What?
- I love the food.

1682
01:47:56,333 --> 01:47:57,625
Really? Nice.

1683
01:47:57,833 --> 01:47:59,166
So, end it then.

1684
01:47:59,458 --> 01:48:01,500
Just end it.
- What?

1685
01:48:01,666 --> 01:48:03,958
The job of being a parent!
Just end it.

1686
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:08,833
You keep going on and on
about how tough it is. So, just end it.

1687
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:12,250
Who has forced you
to continue being parents?

1688
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:13,500
Has anyone forced you to?

1689
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:15,625
You didn't start the job well
in the first place.

1690
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:18,708
And now, I don't understand..
Why continue it?

1691
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:20,250
Just end it. Put an end to it!

1692
01:48:22,041 --> 01:48:26,458
When kids need you the most,
you happily leave them and go.

1693
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:28,458
And then complain about their tantrums
all your life.

1694
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:31,708
<i>Oh, how angry she gets, makes faces!</i>

1695
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:36,000
It was your idea
to bring us into the world. Correct?

1696
01:48:36,166 --> 01:48:39,458
You treated us the way you wanted.

1697
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:42,291
And then you blame us for how we behave!

1698
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:44,708
And you say, it's tough.
What do you mean by that?

1699
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:45,958
Tough, my foot!

1700
01:48:51,375 --> 01:48:52,833
How could you just abandon me?

1701
01:48:55,875 --> 01:48:57,333
How could you just do that?

1702
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:02,416
How could you do that?

1703
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:04,916
How could you both leave me and go?

1704
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:09,291
And the only reason you took me back
was because I failed the second grade.

1705
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:11,166
Yes, I failed the second grade!

1706
01:49:11,333 --> 01:49:12,791
Oh, God! Shame..

1707
01:49:12,916 --> 01:49:15,041
Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!

1708
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:18,125
It was such an embarrassment for you

1709
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:20,375
that you left everything
and came back to India!

1710
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:22,458
Just because I failed the second grade!

1711
01:49:23,083 --> 01:49:27,625
And when I was finally happy
living with my grandparents

1712
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,583
you dragged me away
from there too.

1713
01:49:30,125 --> 01:49:31,416
You separated me even from them.

1714
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:32,583
Yes!

1715
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:35,375
National award just for that!

1716
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:41,333
And I have a fire-cracking news for you!

1717
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,041
Actually, a bomb!

1718
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:44,416
Are you ready?

1719
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:47,083
I have begun therapy!

1720
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:51,375
Yes! I am seeing a brain doctor.

1721
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:53,833
So, instead of calling me crazy or insane
behind my back

1722
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,416
say it to me right now.
Say it on my face! Come on, say it!

1723
01:49:57,583 --> 01:49:59,375
I'm crazy!
<i>Koko!</i>

1724
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,541
<i>Kaira's gone mad!
Mad!</i>

1725
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:09,500
That's what you think..

1726
01:50:12,541 --> 01:50:14,083
That people like me are crazy.

1727
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:17,750
Koko..

1728
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:25,833
She is a bit emotional right now.

1729
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:28,750
She is also out of work.

1730
01:50:28,875 --> 01:50:30,125
Dad, she has enough work.

1731
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:34,166
She has chosen not to work right now.
Okay?

1732
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:36,083
Kiddo, no..

1733
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:42,083
Kiddo, go, get her.
- Don't worry, Mom.

1734
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:43,541
Make her understand

1735
01:50:44,208 --> 01:50:47,041
that once her parents moved back,
she never failed in school again.

1736
01:50:47,916 --> 01:50:51,291
So, they took the right decision.

1737
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:54,125
There are all kinds of failures in world

1738
01:50:55,708 --> 01:50:56,875
and I am looking at a few right now.

1739
01:51:29,416 --> 01:51:30,583
Are you okay?

1740
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,750
I don't know.

1741
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,458
Were you happy as a child?

1742
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,500
I only remember being happy
once you came home.

1743
01:51:57,291 --> 01:51:58,625
See this.

1744
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:02,625
Hey! Where did you find that?

1745
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:05,333
I was looking for something from my past

1746
01:52:06,166 --> 01:52:07,541
and found something from ours instead.

1747
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:22,208
You know..

1748
01:52:22,375 --> 01:52:26,041
As children, when we are sad,
our elders tell us not to cry.

1749
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:29,375
When we are angry,
they tell us, <i>Give us a smile!</i>

1750
01:52:29,708 --> 01:52:31,375
You know why?

1751
01:52:32,208 --> 01:52:34,166
Just to keep the peace at home.

1752
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:37,583
When we wanted to hate,
they didn't allow us.

1753
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:39,875
Now, when we want to love

1754
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,250
we suddenly find our whole
emotional system to be haywire.

1755
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:46,833
It.. It cannot function.

1756
01:52:48,333 --> 01:52:50,083
Sadness, anger, hatred..

1757
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:52,458
We were not allowed to express anything.

1758
01:52:53,791 --> 01:52:55,333
So now, how do we express love?

1759
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:06,250
It's okay to be angry sometimes,
even with parents.

1760
01:53:07,125 --> 01:53:08,375
It's good, it's healthy.

1761
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,166
It's.. It's okay, Kaira.

1762
01:53:25,375 --> 01:53:29,833
They left me at my grandparents' house.

1763
01:53:33,958 --> 01:53:36,625
Mom told me that I would join them soon.

1764
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,625
Perhaps, dad's export business in Goa
had failed.

1765
01:53:45,666 --> 01:53:49,541
So he went to Africa,
Middle East and where not

1766
01:53:49,708 --> 01:53:51,166
looking for business opportunities.

1767
01:53:51,666 --> 01:53:52,875
Mom went with him.

1768
01:53:56,083 --> 01:54:00,375
In the beginning, I was happy
to stay with my grandparents

1769
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:02,958
in their big old house in Vasco.

1770
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:24,208
I would write a letter
to mom and dad every week.

1771
01:54:25,875 --> 01:54:27,291
Sometimes, even twice a week.

1772
01:54:29,833 --> 01:54:31,916
I didn't even know
how to write properly then.

1773
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:36,208
I would draw some pictures, paint them

1774
01:54:37,416 --> 01:54:39,666
and try to write some big words.

1775
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:45,875
But every letter ended
with the same question.

1776
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:50,166
<i>When will you come back?</i>

1777
01:54:54,666 --> 01:54:55,791
I was five years old.

1778
01:54:57,416 --> 01:55:02,083
Every week, I would drop my letters
in the mailbox with my grandpa.

1779
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:05,666
Then I would wait for a letter
in response.

1780
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:08,583
I would wait for an answer to my question.

1781
01:55:14,458 --> 01:55:15,708
But it never came.

1782
01:55:18,791 --> 01:55:23,750
When they called once a month,
they had some excuse each time.

1783
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:28,583
Something about an address change,
no post office close by

1784
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:31,458
feeling unwell and so on..

1785
01:55:33,875 --> 01:55:35,458
But I still kept writing.

1786
01:55:38,208 --> 01:55:40,333
And my grandpa would keep
walking me to the mailbox.

1787
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,291
He always said that I will
get my answer someday.

1788
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:52,291
Then, a year later,
mom visited me in Goa

1789
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:57,875
with my new baby brother, Kiddo.

1790
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:03,208
I was jealous

1791
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:09,041
because he got to be with mom
all the time, and not me.

1792
01:56:11,916 --> 01:56:15,291
Then mom said
that I would be away from them

1793
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:17,916
for just a little longer.

1794
01:56:19,458 --> 01:56:20,875
So, I was still fine with it.

1795
01:56:23,291 --> 01:56:26,833
I remember asking my mom
if she got my last letter.

1796
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:32,875
She said that it was so beautiful
that she put it up on the refrigerator

1797
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:34,458
so that she could see it every day.

1798
01:56:34,875 --> 01:56:36,416
I was so happy!

1799
01:56:38,125 --> 01:56:42,416
I ran to my room so I could
write another letter for her

1800
01:56:43,041 --> 01:56:46,375
to see her smile in front of my own eyes.

1801
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:49,625
I wanted to see her reaction,
her happiness, right away.

1802
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:54,541
So, I took out my colors and paints

1803
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,166
drew a picture

1804
01:56:58,416 --> 01:57:00,500
and ran to show it to her.

1805
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:05,833
As I was about to enter the room,
I heard my grandpa shouting at my mom.

1806
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:10,708
He was telling her that what
she was doing was not right.

1807
01:57:10,875 --> 01:57:12,708
How could she not respond
to my question, to my letters!

1808
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:16,500
And then, I heard my mom reply.

1809
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:20,333
<i>I can't give her false hope.</i>

1810
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:23,500
<i>False hope.</i>

1811
01:57:25,166 --> 01:57:29,583
<i>The truth is that we can't
take her back just yet.</i>

1812
01:57:30,708 --> 01:57:32,541
<i>Not until the business is set up..</i>

1813
01:57:33,541 --> 01:57:35,791
<i>It is too tough to handle two children</i>

1814
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:39,625
<i>and travel constantly.
</i>And she went on with the reasons.

1815
01:57:41,875 --> 01:57:43,125
And everything just seemed

1816
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:45,666
to fade away.

1817
01:57:47,875 --> 01:57:49,541
Everything seemed unclear.

1818
01:57:52,583 --> 01:57:55,041
It was a strange feeling

1819
01:57:58,333 --> 01:58:03,166
like someone had grabbed
the TV remote from me

1820
01:58:04,625 --> 01:58:08,166
and changed the channel
from something I loved

1821
01:58:08,291 --> 01:58:11,083
to something horrid

1822
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:13,916
and then, threw out the remote.

1823
01:58:18,708 --> 01:58:21,041
I went back to my room

1824
01:58:22,166 --> 01:58:23,875
and tore up the letter.

1825
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,958
I was six years old.

1826
01:58:30,208 --> 01:58:33,375
I took a decision as a 6-year-old

1827
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:39,583
that I had nothing more to say to them,
nothing more to ask.

1828
01:58:46,541 --> 01:58:48,583
I didn't write a letter
ever again in my life.

1829
01:58:49,583 --> 01:58:50,750
Never!

1830
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:58,583
My poor grandpa kept trying
to get me to write

1831
01:59:00,125 --> 01:59:02,500
but I knew, I had nothing
to say to my parents

1832
01:59:04,833 --> 01:59:06,833
or to anyone else.

1833
01:59:09,625 --> 01:59:10,958
I just became quiet.

1834
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:13,916
I shut down.

1835
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:23,791
Then, a year later, my mom said
that they were coming back for good.

1836
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:30,958
Dad's friend had offered him
a business partnership here, in Goa.

1837
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:36,083
In all these years, dad couldn't
set up his business abroad.

1838
01:59:36,875 --> 01:59:41,500
So, imagine, all this for nothing!

1839
01:59:43,875 --> 01:59:45,166
So, they came back.

1840
01:59:47,166 --> 01:59:51,458
But that year
was the most stressful for me.

1841
01:59:54,666 --> 01:59:56,791
I didn't want to be with them.

1842
01:59:58,666 --> 02:00:00,625
I wanted to stay with my grandparents.

1843
02:00:02,333 --> 02:00:03,916
They were separating me from them too.

1844
02:00:06,083 --> 02:00:07,458
I threw tantrums

1845
02:00:07,583 --> 02:00:11,208
cried a lot, troubled everyone!

1846
02:00:11,583 --> 02:00:14,166
To top it all, I failed the second grade

1847
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:19,083
and that.. Not my 100 letters

1848
02:00:19,541 --> 02:00:23,708
not the fact that I was their daughter
living away from them

1849
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:27,208
but my failure made them
take me away from my grandparents

1850
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:29,791
and back with them, finally.

1851
02:01:00,708 --> 02:01:02,458
I'm sorry.

1852
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,541
I'm sorry.

1853
02:01:12,333 --> 02:01:14,958
If you don't cry wholeheartedly

1854
02:01:16,458 --> 02:01:20,125
how will you laugh wholeheartedly?
It's okay. Go on.

1855
02:01:27,125 --> 02:01:30,458
I'm not much for rules

1856
02:01:30,625 --> 02:01:35,041
but because of the rules

1857
02:01:36,833 --> 02:01:41,875
I can't pop a champagne bottle
to celebrate this moment

1858
02:01:42,125 --> 02:01:44,916
but we can do the next best thing.

1859
02:01:45,625 --> 02:01:49,500
We can do shots.
We can have water.

1860
02:01:56,291 --> 02:01:57,916
To letters, Kaira.

1861
02:01:58,083 --> 02:01:59,166
Cheers!

1862
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:02,875
Go easy.

1863
02:02:16,833 --> 02:02:21,916
To feel safe, first the fears have to go.

1864
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,666
The fear of being abandoned,
of being left alone.

1865
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,583
You have carried this fear with you
all your life.

1866
02:02:32,458 --> 02:02:36,583
And the burden of that fear
is falling on all your relationships.

1867
02:02:37,541 --> 02:02:40,250
Especially on your love life.

1868
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:46,041
So, you leave others
before they can leave you.

1869
02:02:46,458 --> 02:02:50,666
You want to say bye
before they can say bye.

1870
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:57,791
Because you never want
to face that pain again.

1871
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:02,250
So, Kaira..

1872
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:07,625
Why not say goodbye to this fear

1873
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:10,375
once and for all?

1874
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,875
Why not say hello to life

1875
02:03:15,083 --> 02:03:19,541
once again?
You know..

1876
02:03:21,833 --> 02:03:25,083
I am not saying that you should

1877
02:03:25,958 --> 02:03:27,375
forgive your parents

1878
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,916
or that you should
stop being angry with them.

1879
02:03:29,041 --> 02:03:31,083
You do as you wish.

1880
02:03:31,416 --> 02:03:32,791
But let me tell you that

1881
02:03:33,083 --> 02:03:38,125
you should try to look at them
not in the exalted status of parents

1882
02:03:39,958 --> 02:03:42,666
but just as two regular people

1883
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:47,791
who make mistakes

1884
02:03:47,958 --> 02:03:50,916
like you and I, and everyone else.

1885
02:03:51,125 --> 02:03:53,000
As a child, it is hard
to understand all this

1886
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:54,875
but now, as an adult

1887
02:03:55,208 --> 02:03:56,666
you can at least try.

1888
02:04:00,583 --> 02:04:04,500
Don't let the past blackmail your present

1889
02:04:05,916 --> 02:04:07,833
to ruin a beautiful future.

1890
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:28,333
"When something touches your heart"

1891
02:04:29,208 --> 02:04:32,750
"welcome it."

1892
02:04:34,083 --> 02:04:37,708
"When your heart is not in it"

1893
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,750
"say bye to it."

1894
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:44,458
"Let it come, let it come."

1895
02:04:44,666 --> 02:04:46,666
"Let it come into your heart."

1896
02:04:46,958 --> 02:04:51,208
"Say hello to happiness."

1897
02:04:51,333 --> 02:04:53,333
"Let it go, let it go."

1898
02:04:53,458 --> 02:04:55,500
"Let it go from your heart."

1899
02:04:55,666 --> 02:05:01,750
"Say goodbye to all your fears."

1900
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:06,333
"Love you, my life!"

1901
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:12,000
"Love you, my life!"

1902
02:05:12,166 --> 02:05:16,291
"Love you, my life!"

1903
02:05:16,541 --> 02:05:22,291
"Love me, my life!"

1904
02:05:40,916 --> 02:05:44,250
Koko, I'm sorry.

1905
02:05:46,416 --> 02:05:47,583
I'm sorry.

1906
02:05:49,541 --> 02:05:50,625
Bye.

1907
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,125
Hello?
- <i>Hi, ma'am.</i>

1908
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:53,958
<i>I am calling from eBay.
Are you happy with our services?</i>

1909
02:05:54,083 --> 02:05:56,750
Yes, why?
- <i>Please do continue shopping with us.</i>

1910
02:05:56,875 --> 02:05:59,250
<i>Do let us know if you require
any further assistance.</i>

1911
02:06:14,458 --> 02:06:20,208
"Sometimes, hold my hand"

1912
02:06:20,958 --> 02:06:22,708
"and walk with me."

1913
02:06:23,083 --> 02:06:28,833
"Sometimes, leave my hand"

1914
02:06:29,625 --> 02:06:31,166
"and let me go free."

1915
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,625
"I'm a little moody."

1916
02:06:34,125 --> 02:06:35,958
"You're a little crazy."

1917
02:06:36,166 --> 02:06:40,166
"What a pair, we are!"

1918
02:06:40,291 --> 02:06:42,416
"Let it come, let it come."

1919
02:06:42,583 --> 02:06:44,583
"Let it come into your heart."

1920
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:48,916
"Say hello to happiness."

1921
02:06:49,083 --> 02:06:51,125
"Let it go, let it go."

1922
02:06:51,291 --> 02:06:53,250
"Let it go from your heart."

1923
02:06:53,416 --> 02:07:00,250
"Say goodbye to all your fears."

1924
02:07:01,041 --> 02:07:05,208
"Love you, my life!"

1925
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:09,666
"Love you, my life!"

1926
02:07:09,875 --> 02:07:13,875
"Love you, my life!"

1927
02:07:14,166 --> 02:07:18,500
"Love me, my life!"

1928
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:23,916
You are different.
You are distinct.

1929
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:28,458
You listen to me.
You really listen.

1930
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:34,083
I wish I had someone like you in my life.

1931
02:07:35,125 --> 02:07:36,708
Am I making sense?

1932
02:07:37,250 --> 02:07:40,416
Not at all,
but that will be Rs. 3,000, please.

1933
02:07:40,583 --> 02:07:44,666
"Love you, my life!"

1934
02:07:44,791 --> 02:07:49,041
"Love you, my life!"

1935
02:07:49,166 --> 02:07:55,416
"Love me, my life!"

1936
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:30,291
Where were you?

1937
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:32,125
Just disappeared.

1938
02:08:32,541 --> 02:08:35,708
I have to give proper notice
if I miss a session

1939
02:08:35,833 --> 02:08:39,375
and you left me one small note.

1940
02:08:39,541 --> 02:08:41,583
<i>Sorry</i>. That's not fair!

1941
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:44,625
I know, life is unfair.

1942
02:08:45,625 --> 02:08:46,708
Fine.

1943
02:08:47,833 --> 02:08:49,041
Hide all your secrets.

1944
02:08:55,541 --> 02:08:59,250
You know, my issues with my parents
may get sorted

1945
02:09:00,541 --> 02:09:04,166
but with men..
I don't know when that'll happen.

1946
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,625
I am never going to find anyone.

1947
02:09:13,833 --> 02:09:14,916
Tell me something.

1948
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:21,291
Is there such a thing
as a perfect relationship?

1949
02:09:21,583 --> 02:09:25,500
Like just one, special soul mate?

1950
02:09:27,375 --> 02:09:29,875
I don't know.
Kaira, I think

1951
02:09:30,625 --> 02:09:34,041
why just that one special soul mate?

1952
02:09:36,041 --> 02:09:38,083
I think one can have
many soul mates in life.

1953
02:09:38,208 --> 02:09:40,750
Different soul mates
for different experiences.

1954
02:09:40,958 --> 02:09:44,875
Like.. A special musical relation
with someone

1955
02:09:45,208 --> 02:09:49,708
who shares our interest in music.

1956
02:09:50,375 --> 02:09:53,500
Or the let's-get-coffee-together
soul mates.

1957
02:09:54,041 --> 02:09:58,125
Perfect to have coffee with
but not anything else.

1958
02:09:58,583 --> 02:09:59,708
No.

1959
02:10:00,083 --> 02:10:02,416
Special gossip soul mates

1960
02:10:02,583 --> 02:10:05,750
with whom you can have the perfect gossip.

1961
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:09,208
Or the special intellectual soul mates

1962
02:10:09,375 --> 02:10:13,083
for all those perfect bookish discussions.

1963
02:10:14,208 --> 02:10:18,541
So many different, special soul mates.
So many kinds..

1964
02:10:23,291 --> 02:10:28,041
The romantic soul mate is just one of many.

1965
02:10:29,166 --> 02:10:32,375
I think, every relationship in life
has its own place.

1966
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:37,375
Why put the burden on one person
to fulfill all your emotional needs?

1967
02:10:40,583 --> 02:10:42,250
It's a bit unfair, isn't it?

1968
02:10:49,583 --> 02:10:51,083
Never thought of it this way.

1969
02:11:00,916 --> 02:11:02,333
I'm glad the camera is back.

1970
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:03,541
Me too.

1971
02:11:11,708 --> 02:11:16,125
Jug, do you want to get
a cup of coffee or something?

1972
02:11:17,708 --> 02:11:21,291
No, our time's up.

1973
02:11:24,875 --> 02:11:26,916
You won't bunk the next session, right?

1974
02:11:27,333 --> 02:11:29,083
It is the last week of our sessions.

1975
02:11:29,875 --> 02:11:31,083
How can I miss that?

1976
02:12:02,291 --> 02:12:04,875
So, done sulking with Goa?

1977
02:12:05,375 --> 02:12:06,541
No more sulking.

1978
02:12:08,458 --> 02:12:09,916
What about your work?

1979
02:12:10,083 --> 02:12:12,333
Actually, I got an offer.

1980
02:12:13,125 --> 02:12:14,625
What?
- Yes.

1981
02:12:14,791 --> 02:12:18,416
A production company is interested
in funding my short film.

1982
02:12:18,875 --> 02:12:23,750
So, I am thinking,
why not stay back here and shoot it?

1983
02:12:36,750 --> 02:12:40,458
Since it's the final class, have I passed?

1984
02:12:41,291 --> 02:12:44,708
This isn't school, to pass or fail.

1985
02:12:47,250 --> 02:12:50,375
I wish there were
teachers like you in school.

1986
02:12:50,833 --> 02:12:52,541
I'm no teacher.

1987
02:12:52,958 --> 02:12:55,375
Okay, not a proper teacher

1988
02:12:56,208 --> 02:12:57,541
but you know what I mean.

1989
02:12:58,083 --> 02:13:02,000
We are all our own teachers
in the school of life.

1990
02:13:02,541 --> 02:13:04,583
Okay, that was a bit too deep.

1991
02:13:06,208 --> 02:13:10,916
Life is like a jigsaw puzzle. You know,
the one we played when we were little.

1992
02:13:11,666 --> 02:13:16,166
People like me can help you
find the missing pieces

1993
02:13:16,375 --> 02:13:19,250
and put them in place.

1994
02:13:20,833 --> 02:13:23,208
But only you can complete the puzzle.

1995
02:13:32,958 --> 02:13:34,416
So..

1996
02:13:34,916 --> 02:13:38,333
Now that this is over

1997
02:13:42,666 --> 02:13:47,375
can we meet outside of this?

1998
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:51,250
No..
- Just as friends or something?

1999
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:53,875
No, this is not possible, Kaira.

2000
02:13:54,291 --> 02:13:57,291
And what if I tell you

2001
02:13:57,875 --> 02:13:59,250
that I like you.

2002
02:14:03,875 --> 02:14:04,958
In fact..

2003
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:11,125
Go on, I'm listening.

2004
02:14:14,166 --> 02:14:16,083
In fact, I really like you.

2005
02:14:19,708 --> 02:14:22,125
That's it, I said it.

2006
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,416
I really like you too.

2007
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:30,583
I really like you.

2008
02:14:32,041 --> 02:14:34,208
I respect these feelings

2009
02:14:34,791 --> 02:14:38,000
but my job here is done for now.

2010
02:14:38,708 --> 02:14:40,750
As unconventional

2011
02:14:41,208 --> 02:14:45,041
and friendly, my methods maybe

2012
02:14:45,333 --> 02:14:47,750
I am still your therapist.

2013
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:51,791
Any other relation with you

2014
02:14:51,916 --> 02:14:55,833
would be outside the boundaries
of my own professional ethics.

2015
02:15:00,375 --> 02:15:03,375
The closeness that you feel

2016
02:15:04,166 --> 02:15:06,291
towards me, your brain doctor

2017
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:09,750
is very normal.

2018
02:15:12,291 --> 02:15:16,833
This.. This happens, it's common.

2019
02:15:17,083 --> 02:15:21,541
So, I am common?
- No.. You are not common.

2020
02:15:21,666 --> 02:15:24,625
You are different, special

2021
02:15:24,833 --> 02:15:27,166
and unique!
Really!

2022
02:15:28,333 --> 02:15:32,916
You know, Kaira,
people who come here

2023
02:15:33,583 --> 02:15:36,208
feel all sorts of strong emotions.

2024
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:39,916
Be it anger, hate, love..

2025
02:15:40,875 --> 02:15:43,708
I shouldn't have said anything.
I just shouldn't have.

2026
02:15:43,916 --> 02:15:45,583
No.. You should have!

2027
02:15:45,791 --> 02:15:49,833
I-It's really good
that you said what you said. Really!

2028
02:15:50,708 --> 02:15:55,250
You expressed your difficult feelings

2029
02:15:55,416 --> 02:15:59,791
in a straightforward and mature manner

2030
02:16:00,166 --> 02:16:03,833
rather than letting them fester

2031
02:16:04,083 --> 02:16:06,958
inside of you.

2032
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:09,333
And we don't want that.

2033
02:16:09,625 --> 02:16:10,666
No!

2034
02:16:10,958 --> 02:16:13,125
We don't want that.

2035
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:17,916
This, Kaira, is huge progress.

2036
02:16:32,333 --> 02:16:35,500
Okay, but, tell me something.

2037
02:16:35,916 --> 02:16:37,666
How can this be the last session?

2038
02:16:37,833 --> 02:16:40,208
No..
- What?

2039
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:43,041
I think..
- No more stories?

2040
02:16:43,791 --> 02:16:46,625
There will be so many more problems
in my life.

2041
02:16:46,791 --> 02:16:49,791
Yes, there will be many problems.

2042
02:16:49,916 --> 02:16:53,291
And you will have to solve
all those problems.

2043
02:16:53,666 --> 02:16:56,625
But now

2044
02:16:57,041 --> 02:16:59,416
you know how to solve them.

2045
02:17:02,625 --> 02:17:03,750
Here?

2046
02:17:04,041 --> 02:17:05,833
But I'll need help.

2047
02:17:07,875 --> 02:17:09,041
I need you.

2048
02:17:17,416 --> 02:17:18,541
Kaira

2049
02:17:19,333 --> 02:17:21,625
when you see a pattern emerging in life

2050
02:17:22,166 --> 02:17:26,541
or something becoming a habit,
then it's time to think over it.

2051
02:17:28,125 --> 02:17:30,666
Genius is about knowing when to stop.

2052
02:18:38,291 --> 02:18:39,500
Okay, then.

2053
02:20:41,666 --> 02:20:44,791
Baby Fatima.. Can't believe it!

2054
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:53,583
This is your godmother, Koko!

2055
02:21:03,166 --> 02:21:06,125
<i>Battle after battle</i>

2056
02:21:06,666 --> 02:21:11,541
<i>Corporal Balthazar fought
in the Portuguese army for 14 years.</i>

2057
02:21:13,166 --> 02:21:17,416
<i>Nobody knew that Corporal Balthazar
was not Balthazar</i>

2058
02:21:17,666 --> 02:21:20,500
<i>but Dona Maria, a woman</i>

2059
02:21:20,958 --> 02:21:23,833
<i>disguised as a man.</i>

2060
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:27,458
<i>This was the only way for a woman</i>

2061
02:21:27,625 --> 02:21:30,083
<i>to safeguard her life and dignity.</i>

2062
02:21:30,333 --> 02:21:34,083
<i>For 14 years,
Dona Maria fought two battles.</i>

2063
02:21:34,416 --> 02:21:37,625
<i>One on the battlefield,
and the other with herself</i>

2064
02:21:37,875 --> 02:21:39,166
<i>with her fears.</i>

2065
02:21:40,583 --> 02:21:44,166
<i>Finally, one day on the battlefield,
her true identity was revealed.</i>

2066
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:45,583
<i>As fate would have it</i>

2067
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:47,416
<i>in front of Captain Aphonso.</i>

2068
02:21:54,583 --> 02:21:55,916
<i>Captain Aphonso</i>

2069
02:21:56,166 --> 02:21:58,708
<i>Commander of the fort and a doctor</i>

2070
02:21:58,958 --> 02:22:01,750
<i>not only saved Dona Maria's life
and nursed her wounds</i>

2071
02:22:01,916 --> 02:22:04,625
<i>but made her fears disappear</i>

2072
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:09,250
<i>and freed her from the ghost
of Corporal Balthazar.</i>

2073
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:12,750
<i>For the first time</i>

2074
02:22:12,916 --> 02:22:16,333
<i>Dona Maria had the courage
to face her true self.</i>

2075
02:22:16,958 --> 02:22:21,416
<i>Finally, she felt free.
She felt alive.</i>

2076
02:22:23,958 --> 02:22:28,541
<i>With her newfound courage,
Dona Maria soon</i>

2077

<i>became Commander.</i>

2078
02:22:30,958 --> 02:22:34,541
<i>The first woman Commander
of the Portuguese army.</i>

2079
02:22:36,625 --> 02:22:39,083
<i>Now, Donna Maria fought only one battle.</i>

2080
02:22:39,666 --> 02:22:43,041
<i>The one on the battlefield,
not with herself!</i>

2081
02:23:08,125 --> 02:23:09,583
Good, Kaira!

2082
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:13,875
Amazing, dear! That was great!

2083
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,958
Where is she?
- Kaira! Kaira! Kaira!

2084
02:23:18,083 --> 02:23:22,500
Kaira! Kaira!

2085
02:23:22,625 --> 02:23:27,458
Kaira! Kaira!

2086
02:23:27,583 --> 02:23:30,333
Kaira..
- Kaira!

2087
02:23:36,291 --> 02:23:40,916
Speech! Speech!
- No speech, just shut up!

2088
02:23:42,166 --> 02:23:44,458
It was beautiful, my darling!

2089
02:23:46,291 --> 02:23:48,375
I'm so proud of you, dear.

2090
02:23:49,666 --> 02:23:51,375
Wonderful. Very good!
- Thank you.

2091
02:23:52,916 --> 02:23:54,166
Beautiful film.

2092
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:56,291
Really?
- Very impressed!

2093
02:23:57,125 --> 02:24:00,833
People who make music with the camera
don't need musicians.

2094
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:05,875
I wrote a song for you.
Do you want to hear it?

2095
02:24:06,625 --> 02:24:07,958
Just kidding!

2096
02:24:09,708 --> 02:24:10,791
I'm proud of you.

2097
02:24:11,541 --> 02:24:13,833
You gave Kaira her first break, right?

2098
02:24:13,958 --> 02:24:17,125
Yes. - She could not have
done this without you.

2099
02:24:17,291 --> 02:24:20,958
Actually, if I was with her,
she couldn't have done this.

2100
02:24:22,916 --> 02:24:24,791
Cheers! Cheers!
- Cheers.

2101
02:24:25,291 --> 02:24:27,625
To the longest project of this century!

2102
02:24:29,291 --> 02:24:32,125
Cheers to my baby! Cheers!
- Cheers!

2103
02:24:36,125 --> 02:24:37,708
Hi!
- Hi!

2104
02:24:39,083 --> 02:24:40,166
I was wondering..

2105
02:24:40,291 --> 02:24:43,333
Yes, please tell me,
what were you wondering?

2106
02:24:43,583 --> 02:24:45,791
Would you be able to live
as a man for a few years?

2107
02:24:46,041 --> 02:24:47,083
What?

2108
02:24:48,875 --> 02:24:51,083
The concept of your story
was really interesting.

2109
02:24:52,875 --> 02:24:55,625
How did you come up with the idea?

2110
02:24:56,333 --> 02:24:57,750
What's your story?

2111
02:24:58,250 --> 02:25:00,916
Do you make films too?

2112
02:25:01,083 --> 02:25:02,708
No, I make furniture.

2113
02:25:03,250 --> 02:25:05,958
Tables, sofas, chairs..

2114
02:25:06,666 --> 02:25:09,083
Chairs?
- Yeah.

2115
02:25:09,333 --> 02:25:11,458
Really? Chairs?

2116
02:25:11,958 --> 02:25:13,750
Yes, chairs.

2117
02:25:14,208 --> 02:25:16,208
Chairs!

2118
02:25:53,791 --> 02:25:55,125
<i>Dear life..</i>

2119
02:25:56,083 --> 02:25:58,875
<i>I know, we haven't been
in touch for a while.</i>

2120
02:25:59,958 --> 02:26:01,166
<i>So, nothing..</i>

2121
02:26:02,041 --> 02:26:03,208
<i>Just wanted to say hi!</i>

2122
02:26:16,625 --> 02:26:21,458
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

2123
02:26:24,041 --> 02:26:25,958
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

2124
02:26:26,625 --> 02:26:29,791
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

2125
02:26:30,416 --> 02:26:33,375
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi!

2126
02:26:59,583 --> 02:27:02,750
"When something touches your heart"

2127
02:27:03,333 --> 02:27:06,750
"welcome it."

2128
02:27:08,291 --> 02:27:11,916
"When your heart is not in it"

2129
02:27:12,083 --> 02:27:15,541
"say bye to it."

2130
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:20,916
"Let it come, let it come.
Let it come into your heart."

2131
02:27:21,041 --> 02:27:25,291
"Say hello to happiness."

2132
02:27:25,416 --> 02:27:29,583
"Let it go, let it go.
Let it go from your heart."

2133
02:27:29,708 --> 02:27:36,125
"Say goodbye to all your fears."

2134
02:27:37,333 --> 02:27:41,666
"Love you, my life!"

2135
02:27:41,791 --> 02:27:45,833
"Love you, my life!"

2136
02:27:46,041 --> 02:27:50,375
"Love you, my life!"

2137
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:56,666
"Love me, my life!"

2138
02:28:30,958 --> 02:28:36,666
"Sometimes, hold my hand"

2139
02:28:37,333 --> 02:28:39,458
"and walk with me."

2140
02:28:39,625 --> 02:28:45,833
"Sometimes, leave my hand"

2141
02:28:46,041 --> 02:28:47,583
"and let me go free."

2142
02:28:48,583 --> 02:28:50,333
"I'm a little moody."

2143
02:28:50,625 --> 02:28:52,708
"You're a little crazy."

2144
02:28:52,916 --> 02:28:56,708
"What a pair we are!"

2145
02:28:57,041 --> 02:29:01,250
"Let it come, let it come.
Let it come into your heart."

2146
02:29:01,458 --> 02:29:05,583
"Say hello to happiness."

2147
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:10,083
"Let it go, let it go.
Let it go from your heart."

2148
02:29:10,208 --> 02:29:14,875
"Say goodbye to all your fears."
