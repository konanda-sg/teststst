1
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,720
"Glory to the great Lord Hanuman!".

2
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,480
"Grace our home with
your presence, O Lord Hanuman"

3
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,360
"Grace our home with
your presence, O Lord Hanuman"

4
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,320
"Come, bless our home,
along with Lord Rama..."

5
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,880
"Come, bless our home,
along with Lord Rama..."

6
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
- Baljit!
- Wait!

7
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,040
- Baljit!
- I'll be back in a bit!

8
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,240
"Grace our home with
your presence, O Lord Hanuman"

9
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
"Grace our home with
your presence, O Lord Hanuman..."

10
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,320
The prayers are over
and you've turned up now?

11
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
Give me a break.
My maid skipped work again!

12
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,240
Who's going to do our dishes,
you?

13
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,800
Gular!

14
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,240
"Come, bless our home,
along with Lord Vishnu..."

15
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Gular!

16
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,680
Gular!

17
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,160
Nakul!

18
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,880
Nakul, for your mother's sake!

19
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,640
The sherbet's here!

20
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,160
Here are the rules.

21
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,560
Show me!
Read and understand.

22
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,000
- You especially!
- Let's see if you win.

23
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
- Babli, see the rules.
- Take one each.

24
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
- Come on, let's start!
- Give me one too.

25
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,840
In such a hurry to gamble...

26
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
They've skipped six whole verses!

27
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,600
- Give me one.
- Take this. - One for me.

28
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,840
- Girls, are you ready?
- Yes, yes...

29
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,320
- We're ready.
- Call out the numbers!

30
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,760
- Sixteen. - Wow.

31
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,000
- Forty-six.
- Do it properly, Nakul!

32
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
The jar's so small,
my hand barely fits!

33
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,440
Then tilt it!

34
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,880
All the chips will fall out.
- Fine, continue.

35
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,560
Thief at your door, Number Four.

36
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,920
No luck today!

37
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,000
- Bad luck!
- When will I get this one?

38
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,880
MS Dhoni, Number Seven.

39
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,360
- Okay...
- Bring your mom some luck!

40
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,680
Pack of cards, Fifty-Two.

41
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,400
Your place or mine... Sixty-Nine.

42
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,120
Mine! Sixty-Nine.

43
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Got anything?

44
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,320
Want to check it out?

45
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,360
Inderpuri Bus number Forty-Seven.

46
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,520
I finished a line!

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
Come, see for yourself!

48
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
It's really not my day!

49
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,640
Tell me about it...
- Check it. - All good?

50
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,120
Come on, where's my prize!
- Here you go.

51
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,840
- Oh, no, what's this, Babli?
- What's the problem?

52
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,400
Liquid soap?
Give me a bar instead.

53
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,520
You know how these maids are,
she'll squeeze it out in four days.

54
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,880
Come on, don't make a fuss.

55
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,440
Last time when you gave me Sprite,
did I ask for Fanta?

56
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,400
I know!

57
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Hello. Yeah, I'm a little busy.
Some important work...

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
Can't I have work on a Sunday?

59
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,800
Yeah, I'll be there.
Sure. See you. Bye.

60
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
Buying flowers?

61
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,800
Yeah.

62
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,920
Oh.

63
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,560
When I ask you to buy me flowers,
you get all awkward.

64
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
And today you're gifting flowers?

65
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,400
What else can I buy?

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,320
You'll only buy flowers for me,
understand?

67
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Gift her this.

68
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,200
Are you crazy?

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,640
Don't worry,
she'll appreciate this.

70
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
Are you sure?

71
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,400
Chill, she just wants to meet you.
It's not like we're getting engaged!

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Sure? I mean,
we can get a cheaper bottle...

73
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
Surely she'll appreciate that too.

74
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Thank you, Aunty...
I don't drink, actually.

75
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,960
He's lying, Mom.
He can drink anyone under the table.

76
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
You don't have to feel shy...

77
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,240
Renee had her first drink with me!

78
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,240
Aunty,
actually I need to pick Dad up

79
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,680
so I've to drive back home,
that's why.

80
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,040
Ah! Where do you stay?

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Lodhi Colony.

82
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Father's a government employee?

83
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, railways.

84
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,680
Indian Railway Services, yeah.

85
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,520
No. He's a Ticket Inspector
with the Northern Railways.

86
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
Renee was telling me

87
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,880
- you're going to the US
for onsite work? - Yeah...

88
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,480
Well, laughing at your boss's sad
jokes ought to get you somewhere!

89
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,760
Renee!

90
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,760
I haven't decided yet, Aunty.
Haven't discussed it with my parents.

91
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,840
But I'm sure they'll be
more than happy, no?

92
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,160
Yeah, maybe.

93
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,240
But mom feels a family
should stay together.

94
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,360
I also think I can't
stay away from home for long.

95
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
This wine is really nice.

96
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,680
Thank you.

97
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Really nice, yes.

98
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
- Come again. - Sure.

99
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,360
- Bye, Aunty. - See you.

100
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,200
Oh, 'Kaushiks'!

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,760
You know I've always wondered...

102
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,840
Whether 'Kaushiks' should have
an apostrophe or not...

103
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Mom! - No,
it's just really interesting...

104
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,440
To know what the car owner
wants to say.

105
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,400
That this car belongs
to the Kaushik family...

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Or that there are many
Kaushiks sitting in it?

107
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,720
Well, Aunty, the car is ours.

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,880
And I've got the papers to prove it.

109
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,280
But only my brother can say
what this is supposed to mean.

110
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
He got this done.

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,360
As far as this horror-movie
font is concerned...

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,920
I think it probably wants to say,
our family's a little... Spooky.

113
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
We must beware, then.

114
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,520
- Goodbye, Aunty. - Goodbye.
- See you.

115
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
What?
- Come on.

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Where is he?

117
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,320
- Ravinder! - Yes, sir.

118
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,800
- Here's a piece of advice.
Listen carefully. - Okay.

119
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,400
Hey... It'll fall!

120
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,960
Look. You're already married.

121
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,000
But before you have a baby...
Think it through. Plan it properly.

122
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
Today's generation...
They're not like us.

123
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,880
They neither value their parents,
nor their time.

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
There he comes!

125
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,640
Thank God!

126
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
I've been waiting
since half an hour!

127
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,840
Why're you lying, Dad?
The train arrived five minutes ago!

128
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,040
Stand in this heat and you'll
know how it feels.

129
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
What are you doing?

130
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
It's his job.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Fine, give him mangoes.

132
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,560
Wait.

133
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,560
Here.

134
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,680
Go, enjoy.

135
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Do they grow in our backyard?

136
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,560
Drive slow.

137
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,560
It doesn't speed up
even on top gear!

138
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,840
"Drive slow!"

139
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,360
Told you so many times,
let me get a new car...

140
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,640
What's wrong with this one?

141
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,360
It's been over 13 years.
I've had no problems with it.

142
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,080
Just listen to yourself.

143
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,880
Reached, finally!

144
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,040
Mr. Kaushik!

145
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,560
Hello... All well?

146
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,800
- Carry the carton carefully.
- Yes.

147
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,000
- Hello, Uncle.
- Got mangoes, son?

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,960
Yes, Uncle.

149
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
Not that dad's going to share any...

150
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,760
Mom...
How're the mangoes?

151
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,360
Really sweet, son. Delicious!

152
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,240
Not a patch on 'Langra' mangoes.
Those are a class apart.

153
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,640
They've called me early to office...

154
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,640
They go to the office
together every day...

155
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,480
And he's still always
on the phone with her.

156
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
I don't get it!

157
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,280
He's grown up.
Let him do as he pleases.

158
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,800
Focus on the younger one. His
final-year exams are approaching!

159
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,400
God knows what he'll do.

160
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,200
What will he do?
Embarrass us, what else!

161
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
We'll have to hand him
everything on a platter.

162
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,240
I'll have to use up
my retirement fund!

163
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,680
Nakul never gave us any trouble.
Especially when it came to studies.

164
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,800
Gular...

165
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,680
Gular! Dad got us mangoes, son.
Have some.

166
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,320
Not interested, Mom.
You help yourself.

167
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,280
Look at his attitude.
Won't even talk properly!

168
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,320
Why blame him? It's your fault.

169
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,840
Before he was born, didn't you
leave Khatauli and go to Meerut

170
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
to your parents'?

171
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,080
He was bound to be detached!

172
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
The water in that city is cursed.

173
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,920
Even Shravan Kumar the devoted
son from the Ramayana

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,920
betrayed his parents there.

175
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,920
What are you staring at?

176
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,960
It's in the scriptures!

177
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
Tell you what.

178
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,640
The demon Raavan's wife Mandotari,
didn't she also hail from Meerut?

179
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,840
Of course, I'm the witch
haunting this blessed home!

180
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,600
After all,
your son is Lord Rama incarnate!

181
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,320
- Oh, Babli, what's all this?
- You keep quiet!

182
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,040
So tell me,
what's wrong with my son?

183
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,680
Tell me.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,640
In fact, may God bless everyone
with a son like him...

185
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,400
Mom, can't you give it a break?

186
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,560
When she speaks against you,
you barely squeak...

187
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,560
And you boss over
your poor old mother!

188
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,920
That's your only weakness, Jeetu!

189
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,080
You're scared of your wife!

190
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
Why, mom...
- "Why, mom!"

191
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Polished off three slices...

192
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,680
"Not a patch on 'Langra'!",
she says!

193
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,160
Goddamn, imagine my plight. Spending
all afternoon playing Bingo host!

194
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,800
- Aunty was there too!
- Which aunty?

195
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,200
Your mom!

196
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,920
"Which aunty?"

197
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,960
After they were done playing Bingo...

198
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,080
As I was smoking a cigarette
on the terrace...

199
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,880
Chawla Aunty's daughter-in-law
tried getting cozy with me!

200
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,400
I politely told her, "Spare me,
Sister! I'm a simple guy.

201
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,960
I don't want to jump
into bed with you!"

202
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,800
- Nonsense! You're lying.
- I swear, I'm not!

203
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,800
- You didn't do anything?
- No, man.

204
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,640
How, dude?
I think she's smoking hot!

205
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,240
No, bro, not in the colony...

206
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,080
Just say the truth-
you chickened out.

207
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,960
Junney... I'm no chicken...

208
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,520
And we all know
who's the real wuss here!

209
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,200
Dimple's been posting tons
of pictures with her hubby recently.

210
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,040
- Show me.
- Saw them? - Show me!

211
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,960
She looks so happy finally.

212
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,840
Right, Junney?

213
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,920
Have a look!

214
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,440
Bloody rascal!

215
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,600
Bro, you were always worried
that you couldn't 'make her happy'...

216
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,800
And now that she's happy,
you're jealous!

217
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,520
Bastards,
I never should've told you.

218
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,920
I trusted you like brothers.

219
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,960
Got drunk and confided in you.
Fine, go on!

220
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,800
Man, you're getting all serious,
Junney.

221
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,400
We're childhood friends,
can't we pull your leg?

222
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,640
Now that you've told us it's a
sore spot... We won't touch it. Okay?

223
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,800
Next time,
we'll stand and stomp on it!

224
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,120
Tell us, what does
he have that you don't?

225
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,240
Damn!

226
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,760
- Are you okay?
- Man, he got upset.

227
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,560
Balls! Can't take a joke
but makes fun of others.

228
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,960
You're no different!
Okay?

229
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,440
What is it? - Mango pulp.

230
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,680
Babli...

231
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,680
If you've cooled off now,
can I show you something?

232
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,160
I barely have the time
to read all this now...

233
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,880
My poem's been published!

234
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
- Really?
- Yes. Page number 34.

235
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,520
'Season of Communion', by...

236
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
The Brooding Poet.

237
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,640
I've told you so many times
don't use that pen name!

238
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,880
It sounds like you're
always distraught.

239
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,800
Why would I be distraught
with you by my side!

240
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,120
It's just poetic license, silly.

241
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,480
Thank God you weren't married
to Harivansh Rai Bachchan...

242
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,640
Or you would've told him...

243
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,960
"Bachcha" means child,
it sounds so childish!"

244
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,920
The skies are roaring tonight?

245
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,560
- Should I read it out?
- Yes.

246
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,440
'Season of Communion'.

247
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,680
"Today, upon the fertile land..."

248
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,080
"Today, upon the fertile land"

249
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480
"The sky rains down"

250
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
"- The sky... - Rains down!"

251
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,600
"Parched land and dark clouds"

252
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,280
"An enchanting encounter"

253
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,560
"A flaming bolt strikes..."

254
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,600
A flaming bolt, meaning?

255
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,560
Lightening.

256
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,720
"A flaming bolt strikes"

257
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
"Born is a tender song of love"

258
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,200
"Seeds sprout life from dead rocks"

259
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,120
"As estrangement departs..."

260
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
- It's lovely.
- You know something?

261
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,720
You look beautiful
with your hair open.

262
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,040
Hush, stop it!

263
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,680
19 WEEKS LATER

264
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,600
Listen... How does it look?

265
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
It can be tightened from the back.

266
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,600
What's the occasion?
I can help you decide accordingly.

267
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,120
My cousin's getting married
in Meerut. Didn't I tell you?

268
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,360
One second.

269
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Why don't you get
something like this?

270
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,800
This?

271
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,240
Are you judging my family's taste?

272
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,240
It's so much fun.
You get irritated so easily!

273
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,560
- Yes, Dad! - Where are you?

274
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm shopping for Shanoo's wedding.

275
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,760
Mom's unwell
and you're busy shopping!

276
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,760
What happened to her?

277
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,320
Take her to Dr. Bagga's, quick!

278
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Okay, I'll be there right away.

279
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,080
- Let's go, quick! - Where?

280
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,880
Mom's not well... I have to go.

281
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,400
- Wait a second. - Yes.

282
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,760
- At least change your clothes.
- Oh, shit.

283
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,320
- Don't worry, I'll get it billed.
- Okay.

284
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,880
Looks fine.

285
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
127/82...

286
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,960
You're taking your medicines
on time, right?

287
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes.

288
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,480
You're perfectly fit!

289
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
Bagga Uncle, actually,
it's not BP...

290
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,440
Let me talk to your mother!

291
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,400
Yes, tell me.

292
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,400
Doctor, I haven't been
feeling well since a day or two.

293
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,320
I'm constantly exhausted;
I've lost my appetite...

294
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,560
My stomach's been cramping...
And I've vomited a few times too.

295
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,600
Oh, so that's the matter...

296
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,600
You must have eaten
some rubbish from the streets.

297
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,720
I see you've put on weight too!

298
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,920
People these days
have no self-control.

299
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,480
Mr. Mathur came to me
right before you.

300
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
He's got piles.

301
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,160
Piles.

302
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Open your mouth.

303
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,520
He's shitting blood. Blood!

304
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,240
And he still won't
stop gorging on that junk.

305
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,120
Then he'll complain, "Doctor,
the medicines aren't working!"

306
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,040
Nakul, could you just go and call
dad, ask where he's reached.

307
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,160
Mom, let the check-up
get over at least.

308
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,320
Do as I say, please...

309
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,240
Bagga Uncle, I had a...
'Lady-problem' as well.

310
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,240
If you could call Aunty...

311
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,280
- Sure!
- Just for a check-up.

312
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
Hello Aunty...

313
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Aunty?

314
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,880
What are you doing outside?

315
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,960
- I just couldn't reach your phone!
- How's mom doing?

316
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Bagga and his wife
are both examining her.

317
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,440
Okay... Take this, pay the fare.

318
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,160
How much?

319
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Hello, Doctor...

320
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,920
The train halted
at Faridabad Junction, so...

321
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,120
Dad... Is everything okay?

322
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
Yes, it's all good, son...

323
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,240
I mean, the doctor
suggested a few tests...

324
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Tests?
- Yes, just regular ones...

325
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,920
Mom wants you
to head back home...

326
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,760
Grandma will be back
from the prayer meet soon.

327
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
If she finds the house locked

328
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,040
she'll create a ruckus.
Gular isn't home either.

329
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,680
- So I'll leave? - Yes.

330
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,680
Just give me the car keys.

331
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,880
What about Mom?

332
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,400
She's perfectly fine...
Don't worry!

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,240
You carry on.

334
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Rickshaw, stop!

335
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Pregakem...
Pregnancy Detection Kit.

336
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,320
Don't be so surprised.

337
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,960
There have even been cases

338
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,680
where the mother's only
realized at the time of delivery!

339
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
Look it up online.

340
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,240
Considering your age,
and because it's been detected late...

341
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,040
You'll need to decide soon
if you want an operation.

342
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't worry. Think it over for 2-4 days.

343
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,760
But don't delay it further.

344
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,040
Or the risk will increase. Okay?

345
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm not getting an abortion.

346
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,840
What do you mean?

347
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,640
I mean, just think it over.

348
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,000
Even the doctor said,
take 2-4 days and decide...

349
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
It could be risky...

350
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,560
Whatever the risk, I'm sure
about this. I can't kill my child.

351
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,680
Listen, Babli... Why be stubborn?

352
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,920
At this age,
can your body bear this burden?

353
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,920
Has my baby been a burden till now?

354
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,800
There's no way
I'm getting an abortion.

355
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,840
I believe it's a sin.
You speak for yourself.

356
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,880
All I'm asking is...
Can we handle this?

357
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,080
Think about it, Babli.

358
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,520
There'll be expenses,
so much responsibility... No?

359
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,160
Fine.

360
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,960
It's your body. The final decision
has to be yours too.

361
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Okay?

362
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,640
Let's take a final call.

363
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,600
You're sure, right?

364
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,920
I've already told you... Why are
you asking again and again?

365
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,800
Yes... Yes, son.

366
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,560
Yes, we're coming home.

367
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,040
It's all fine. Yes.

368
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,200
Will you tell us what Bagga said?
Everything's okay, right?

369
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
Yes...

370
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,520
- Gular, why don't you come sit
with us? - No, I'm good here.

371
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,400
Anyway, India's innings
begins in 5 minutes.

372
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,200
Oh, okay. What's the target?

373
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,480
- 271. - Ah. Will we win?

374
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,960
We'll watch and find out, right?

375
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,440
You're worried about the match?
India's on a winning streak anyway!

376
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,160
What's wrong with Mom?
I've been asking you for an hour!

377
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,920
Is she fine?

378
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,920
Yeah, that's why I
called you guys here.

379
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,160
Umm... Mom's been unwell
for the past few days, right?

380
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,800
So the doctor got a few tests done...

381
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,600
So the doctor said...

382
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,760
The doctor said that...

383
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,240
- We're expecting a guest at home.
- A guest?

384
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,800
I'm not vacating my room, Dad!
I'm telling you already...

385
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,840
A 'little guest'.

386
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Little guest?

387
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120
- What little guest?
- That's what the doctor said...

388
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,280
Ma... Got back late from
the prayer meet today?

389
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,680
Jeetu, son...

390
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,280
Aren't you sleepy?

391
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,520
Ma, I needed
to tell you something...

392
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,760
Hmm... What is it?

393
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,480
A little gently...

394
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes, Ma.

395
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,560
"I want my own room,
I want my own room..."

396
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,160
Wanted your own room, you brat?

397
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,760
Couldn't sleep between Mom
and Dad for a few more years?

398
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
So is it my fault?

399
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,920
Ma, Priyamvada was feeling ill
for the past few days, so...

400
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,400
What do I tell you, Jeetu...

401
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,400
There's no illness
worse than old age.

402
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,120
The body aches,
and so does the heart...

403
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,960
Oh Lord Almighty...

404
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,440
Ma... She's carrying...

405
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,440
The Almighty is omnipotent...

406
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,160
He controls everything.

407
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,360
We all carry our own burden...

408
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,040
The Guru told us
at the prayer meet...

409
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,320
Whatever life offers you...

410
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,840
Accept it as His blessing.

411
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,800
Don't ask questions.

412
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,200
Don't stress yourself...

413
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,720
It's all God's will...

414
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,560
Ma says it's God's will!

415
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,880
Jeetu son,
his blessings are upon you...

416
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,120
You guys are the limit!

417
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
Eh! What happened to him?

418
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
The water must be hot by now.

419
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Priyamvada... Keep the bucket
in the bathroom, will you?

420
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,800
I'll keep it.

421
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Sit, where are you going!
Let her do it.

422
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,240
Gular...
Go keep the bucket please.

423
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,960
Let him eat in peace...
Does she have nail paint on?

424
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,320
Ma,
didn't I tell you last night?

425
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,680
What did you tell me?

426
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,080
Gular... Bolt the door, son.

427
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,760
Where are you off?

428
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,600
It's not such good news,
that I must hear it again!

429
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
Good news?

430
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,120
What did he say, Jeetu?

431
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,200
Ma, I told you last night...

432
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,280
What did you tell me?

433
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,560
You're going to become
a grandmother...

434
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Can't hear you. Say it again.

435
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,920
Priyamvada's expecting...

436
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,040
As in?

437
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,560
She... I mean,
we're going to have a baby.

438
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,720
What?

439
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Jeetu...

440
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,960
Children are meant to bring
glory to their parents...

441
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,920
But you didn't even
give your kids a chance!

442
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,560
You'll make them famous!

443
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,840
Everyone's going to say...

444
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,400
"Look at Jitender's kids."

445
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,840
"Look at Jitender's kids,
cradling Jitender's kid!"

446
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,680
He's old enough
to have his own kid.

447
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,960
Now he'll be raising
a baby brother!

448
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,040
I used to tease Nakul saying

449
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll die only after I see
a toddler in his arms...

450
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,560
Looks like your wife
took it seriously!

451
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,080
Have you two abandoned
all shame? Completely?

452
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,000
When I'd watch
the holy sermons on TV

453
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,360
you'd turn it off
and switch to the news.

454
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,880
Here's the result-

455
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,760
Now you'll be on the news!

456
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,120
Stand right here! Look at me!

457
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,640
Face me! Look this way.

458
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,160
First of all, I want to know...
When did you find the time for this?

459
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,520
You better give me an answer.

460
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,520
When I ask you
to sit and talk to me

461
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,320
you always say
you're exhausted...

462
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,560
Actually, you're just
in a hurry to lock your door!

463
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,720
Now I understand...

464
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,440
Why her body aches
every morning!

465
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,280
Ma, you're blowing this
out of proportion...

466
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
Well, you're a man after all

467
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,360
just like your father.
It's in your genes.

468
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,800
But what about her

469
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,280
the doctor's daughter...
Didn't she know better?

470
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,800
Her sons are all grown up,
and she still flaunts lipstick!

471
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,920
Where are you running off? Stop!

472
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,720
- Ma, we'll be back in five minutes.
- Listen to me!

473
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,480
Where are you running off?

474
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,920
- Mrs. Kaushik!
- I've had enough!

475
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
Listen, Babli... Babli!

476
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,080
Mr. Kaushik!
- Yes?

477
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,480
- Is everything fine?
- Mind your own business, mister!

478
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,560
Please, Babli... Stop!

479
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,480
Look, don't spoil your mood.

480
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
Thankfully she can't go around
without her walker...

481
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,600
Or she'd have announced it
to the entire colony by now!

482
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,960
You know how she is...

483
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,960
Her anger fizzes out
just as quickly as it explodes.

484
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
She's probably forgotten
about it by now.

485
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,600
Forget about me... You didn't
even listen to the government!

486
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,240
On the radio,
in the papers, on TV...

487
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,320
They cried themselves
hoarse on family planning:

488
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,440
"Two of us, two of ours!"

489
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,200
Even I saw the ads

490
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,440
and understood
what protection means!

491
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,880
And you guys didn't get it?

492
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,720
Did I conceive this child alone?

493
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,200
She promptly gave you
a clean chit...

494
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,600
And tore me to shreds!

495
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,160
"Look at the doctor's daughter,
flaunting lipstick..."

496
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,800
Why get my father into this?

497
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,760
Amazing!

498
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,360
And he's a government servant,
to top it!

499
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,640
It beats me...

500
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,160
If he can't obey the government

501
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,240
how has he worked
for them all these years?

502
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,160
Please, Babli, don't be angry.

503
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,880
It doesn't suit your pretty face.

504
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,760
Don't you dare flatter me!

505
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,560
This is exactly
what has led to this!

506
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,640
I..

507
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,840
What's the time?

508
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,960
Turn back - let's go home.

509
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,400
If Ma misses her medicines,
I'll be blamed for that too.

510
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,280
The kids also left
without eating in the morning.

511
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,800
Should I play a song?

512
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,600
<i>Alas, what just happened?</i>

513
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,320
<i>How did it happen?</i>

514
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,320
<i>When it happened...</i>

515
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,360
<i>Now, what can one say?</i>

516
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,280
<i>Alas, what just happened?</i>

517
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,760
<i>How did this happen?</i>

518
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,360
<i>When it happened...
Why it happened...</i>

519
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,480
<i>Well, it is what it is...</i>

520
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,640
- Hello...
- Hi, where are you?

521
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,240
I've been trying to call you...

522
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,040
Your phone was off. Messaged
you at night, no reply...

523
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,600
What's up, is everything okay?

524
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,840
How's Aunty?

525
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,520
I'll call you later.

526
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,200
- Nakul? - Okay, bye.

527
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,400
What the... - <i>Let it go,
don't fret about it...</i>

528
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,600
<i>Alas, what just happened?</i>

529
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,720
He's back.
- Don't you dare lock the door!

530
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,800
Can I turn off the lights?

531
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,080
<i>Congrats, my dear,
congrats to you!</i>

532
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,160
- Are you drunk early morning?
- It's not like that...

533
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,440
Virender?
Are you talking to Virender?

534
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,920
It's all thanks
to your mushy poetry!

535
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,200
- Give me the phone...
- Listen, Ma wants to talk...

536
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,160
I want to speak to him...

537
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,480
- Virender? - What happened?

538
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,200
They did it!

539
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,040
What? - They did it again!

540
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,080
Hello? <i>- To the Fam, to the Gran,
to the Daddy and his clan</i>

541
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,520
<i>Congrats to them too!</i>

542
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,400
It got disconnected, Ma.

543
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,120
Good morning.

544
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,720
Mr. Kaushik!

545
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,560
Is everything fine?

546
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,720
Very well, thanks...
How about you?

547
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
All good!

548
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,240
It's time for my train, so...

549
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,440
<i>Tried giving a missed call
But damn, it got received!</i>

550
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,160
Not as innocent as he looks,
is he?

551
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,840
At least he does more
than just snore in bed!

552
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,840
So, the easiest
and most effective

553
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,120
method of contraception
is the condom...

554
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,120
- What is it? - Condom!

555
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,160
What will he do?
Embarrass us, what else.

556
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,880
We'll have to hand him
everything on a platter.

557
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
I'll have to use up
my retirement fund!

558
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,720
Nakul never gave us any trouble.

559
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,760
Especially when it came to studies.

560
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,880
Gular!

561
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,440
Oh, congratulations!
- Shh! Get inside.

562
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,880
Come here.

563
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,880
Congrats!

564
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,480
Bagga couldn't keep it
under wraps!

565
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,960
Anyway, how long could
you've kept this under wraps?

566
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,640
By God, I'm so jealous!

567
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,880
<i>Congrats, my dear!</i>

568
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,200
Look at her blush!

569
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,080
<i>Congrats, Missus,
congrats to you!</i>

570
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,200
<i>To the Fam, to the Gran,
to the Daddy and his clan...</i>

571
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,640
<i>Congrats to them</i>

572
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,400
<i>- Dammit!</i>
- Nakul!

573
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,320
<i>Here you are ramshackled
Completely past retrieval</i>

574
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,120
<i>The news is all over the place!</i>

575
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,240
<i>What will you do now, dear?</i>

576
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,280
<i>When happiness bites your rear</i>

577
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,960
<i>How will you show
the world your face?</i>

578
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,360
- Hello, Aunty! - Hello.

579
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,240
- Is Nakul around?
- No, he left for office...

580
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,920
- Why don't you come in?
- It's okay, Aunty... I'll call him up.

581
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,600
- Okay... - How are you?
- Very well...

582
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,880
Hello, Aunty! - Is Nakul home?

583
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,800
No, son, he's not back yet.

584
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,320
Okay, Aunty.
Tell him I came over.

585
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,920
<i>To the Fam, to the Gran,
to the Daddy and his clan...</i>

586
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,520
<i>Congrats to them</i>

587
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,240
<i>No, never!</i>

588
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,520
<i>Swollen so much with joy
Your chest might burst, you said</i>

589
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,600
<i>You fired into thin air and
an elephant fell on your head</i>

590
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,600
<i>Swollen so much with joy
Your chest might burst, you said</i>

591
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,600
<i>You fired into thin air and
an elephant fell on your head</i>

592
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,480
Congrats, Mr. Kaushik!

593
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,400
Many, many congrats!

594
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,120
Congratulations!

595
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,560
<i>What will you do now, dear?</i>

596
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>When happiness bites your rear</i>

597
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,320
<i>How will you show
the world your face?</i>

598
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,280
<i>Dammit!</i>

599
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,720
<i>Congrats, Missus,
congrats to you!</i>

600
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,640
<i>Congrats, Missus,
congrats to you!</i>

601
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,040
<i>To the Fam, to the Gran,
to the Daddy and his clan...</i>

602
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,280
<i>- Congrats to them too!
- No, never!</i>

603
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,480
No ginger in the tea for you,
it can cause acidity.

604
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,840
Add cardamom instead?

605
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,760
Let me check.

606
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,600
- Hello, Aunty. - Hello...

607
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,120
You are?

608
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,280
Aunty, I'm Renee...
Nakul's colleague.

609
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,440
We go to office together...

610
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,840
Yes, of course! Please come in.

611
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,720
Heard so much about you...

612
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,440
But we've never met,
so didn't recognize you.

613
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,080
Come, have a seat.

614
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,200
These are for you, Aunty.

615
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,680
Oh... Thank you.

616
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,960
Please sit!

617
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,440
Nakul!

618
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,880
He went for a bath,
must be getting dressed!

619
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,760
Okay, he'll be here.

620
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,800
How are you feeling now, Aunty?

621
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,360
I'm fine.

622
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,400
Nakul didn't come to office all week
and wasn't answering his phone...

623
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,400
So I thought I'd drop by to check.

624
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,200
- Oh, is it? - Hello, Uncle.

625
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,280
Renee... She and Nakul
go to office together...

626
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,080
Oh yes. Good, good...
Very good.

627
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Why are you standing up?
Sit down.

628
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,880
Tea?

629
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,920
No, Uncle... Thank you.

630
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,680
Little tea? I made.

631
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,880
I don't drink tea.

632
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,920
I want to give it up too

633
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,800
but I can't clear my bowels
without my morning tea!

634
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,200
You're working together
with Nakul, right?

635
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,720
Same pay scale?

636
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,880
Enough, already! - Yes, Uncle.

637
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Good! I am... Northern Railways...
Ticket Inspector.

638
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,720
Nakul... Your friend!

639
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,080
I'm offering tea,
but she's not taking.

640
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,440
- Very shy... - Yeah, okay.

641
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,080
Why are you talking in English?

642
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,720
If you'd like some cola,
Nakul can quickly go and get it.

643
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,960
We don't keep the big
bottles at home...

644
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,600
Once opened, it loses its fizz.
Gets wasted.

645
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,480
- Would you like sherbet instead?
- Mom, we don't have time.

646
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,120
We have an urgent meeting,
that's why she's here.

647
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,680
We have to leave right now.
Let's go.

648
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,560
Aunty...
We're already running late...

649
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,480
- Come again, okay? - Yes, Aunty.

650
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,240
At least leave
your towel behind!

651
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,920
Always in a hurry...
- Where are you off to?

652
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,520
Putting the towel out to dry.

653
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,400
She looks Punjabi, no?

654
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,040
Thank you for paying visit!

655
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,840
Couldn't you tell me before coming?

656
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,720
It's my fault?

657
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,760
Fine, I won't come again.

658
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
Am I saying that?

659
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,480
Shouldn't you have told me
before you disappeared?

660
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,040
Of course I told Vikrant
I'd be on leave for a few days.

661
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,520
How does Vikrant matter?

662
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,920
- He's my boss, isn't he?
- What about me?

663
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,200
Don't I deserve to know?

664
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,400
You're not responding
to my calls and messages...

665
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,720
Everyone's been asking me...

666
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,240
Even Vikrant's been asking me...

667
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,720
"What happened, is everything
okay at his place?"

668
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,560
And if you're so uncomfortable
with me meeting your parents...

669
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,560
Fine. Let's call it quits.

670
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,520
Am I saying that? You're
taking off on another tangent!

671
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
So then tell me,
what's the problem? Now.

672
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,640
Well, my mum...

673
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,080
Mum's pregnant.

674
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
So are there any complications
in the pregnancy?

675
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,600
Wait a minute. Who's pregnant?

676
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,320
- Mum as in, your mum?
- Who else's, yours?

677
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,840
While other parents arrange
their sons' marriages

678
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,200
mine are arranging
for the Sarbala too!

679
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,240
<i>'Sarbala'?</i>

680
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,640
The little kid who rides with the
groom on horseback at our weddings!

681
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
<i>Sarbala!</i>

682
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,120
Nakul...

683
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,240
I was laughing
at the Sarbala joke.

684
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,200
Nothing else is funny.

685
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,200
Stop laughing.

686
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,480
Stop laughing.

687
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,520
Sorry.

688
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,840
Done?

689
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,920
Listen, I hope you didn't tell your
mum that I've not been in office.

690
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,040
I'll get the door.

691
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,920
Nakul... She's the one
you go to office with, right?

692
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,200
She's very sweet...
What's her name, again?

693
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,120
- Renee. - Yes, Renee!

694
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,600
Listen, son...

695
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,600
Had you taken leave from office?

696
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,640
Yes.

697
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,880
We have to leave for Meerut in two
weeks, for Shanoo's wedding, so...

698
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,400
It won't be a problem
taking leave then, would it?

699
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,520
Mom, I'm not going.

700
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,680
How can you say that?
It's Shanoo's wedding!

701
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,680
Because I've decided -
I can't go.

702
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,880
There's lots of work in office.

703
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,080
What nonsense!
Have you gone nuts?

704
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,600
What will your aunt think,
what will people say?

705
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,960
Shouldn't you have
thought of that?

706
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,800
Of what people will say?

707
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,640
What did you say?

708
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,640
Where are his manners?

709
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,360
Is this how you talk
to your father?

710
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,800
I'll... I'll talk to him.
- What will you tell him?

711
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,440
What about you?
Will you be coming?

712
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,840
I already told Ma... My final
year exams are round the corner.

713
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,880
- I'll explain... - No! Enough.

714
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,040
You needn't plead with anyone.

715
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,280
'Attention, passengers.'

716
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,040
'Uttaranchal Express
from New Delhi to Meerut'

717
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,520
'will be arriving on platform...'

718
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,960
Jeetu!

719
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,960
Chawla!

720
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,320
How are you, Brother?

721
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,080
You haven't changed one bit!

722
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,560
- How are you? - Very well.

723
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,040
- Hello! - Put this up.

724
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,720
Jeetu, give me your bag.
- It's okay, it's not heavy.

725
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,240
Ma, remember Chawla?

726
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,040
- Yes. - Hello, Aunty.

727
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,200
Where did your hair disappear?

728
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,400
Let's get going.

729
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,800
Babli,
get in from the other side.

730
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,600
- Counted the luggage?
- Yes, I did.

731
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,160
No, no!
You don't have to pay him.

732
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,440
- He's from our staff...
It's his job! - Never mind.

733
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,160
Give it back!

734
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,640
Chawla, the clock tower
stills looks the same!

735
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,000
- Hasn't changed a bit!
- Meerut need not change.

736
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,520
You checked the spelling
of 'welcome', right?

737
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,200
It's correct, sir- I've checked.

738
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,960
- Just Google and confirm it once.
- Okay, sir.

739
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,880
Arrange it in a line, son.

740
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,560
Jeetu's here?

741
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,640
Go tell Guddan, Jeetu's arrived!

742
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,640
They've reached.

743
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,400
Jeetu's finally here... Jeetu!

744
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,640
- Welcome! - Many congrats!

745
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,680
And double-congrats to you!

746
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,080
- Hello, Aunty, please come!
- Hello.

747
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,320
Banwari's decorating the venue,
is it?

748
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,720
Ah, you remember, I see!

749
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,720
The decoration looks tip-top,
doesn't it?

750
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,600
It looks amazing.

751
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,160
This is what one earns for,
right?

752
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,240
Look, Sister, this Sari
doesn't have any lining!

753
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,080
- Guddan, look who's here!
- He's here?

754
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,760
Chhotu, go collect the luggage!

755
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,080
God bless! How are you?
- God bless!

756
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,240
Ma! How are you?
- Come, Priyam...

757
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,960
I've been waiting to see you ever
since I heard the good news!

758
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,440
How are you, Priyam?

759
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,040
The boys didn't come?

760
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,880
The thing is... Gular's exams
are coming up, so...

761
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,960
What about Nakul?

762
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,480
Some important
office work came up...

763
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,120
That's not done.

764
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,920
What could be more important
than his sister's wedding?

765
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,400
Let it go... Don't ruin your
mood at your daughter's wedding.

766
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,640
Will you let us in, or are we
having a seminar right here?

767
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,880
Guddan, get them tea.
Let's talk inside...

768
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,560
Come...

769
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,800
Come slowly.

770
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,280
Let's go.

771
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,240
No, there's lots of work today...
I'll be late.

772
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,840
Okay... I'll leave then.

773
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,920
Yeah carry on.

774
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,600
Mom's on tour
and the maid's on leave too.

775
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,400
There's no one at home.

776
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,040
I guess I'll have to cook
and clean by myself.

777
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,600
No one's home?

778
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,240
Just wait five minutes...
I'll tell Vikrant...

779
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,280
Where is Vikrant?

780
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,920
I'll help you with the cooking.

781
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,400
Cool.

782
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,800
Wait!

783
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,120
Tell Vikrant
an emergency came up.

784
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,440
<i>Your Lover, he's ready</i>

785
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,840
<i>In your captivity</i>

786
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,640
<i>At least take a glance</i>

787
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,680
<i>At what his eyes say</i>

788
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,120
<i>Your Lover, he's ready</i>

789
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,880
<i>In your captivity</i>

790
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,560
<i>At least take a glance</i>

791
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,960
<i>At what his eyes say</i>

792
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,160
<i>Give me a yes and take my life</i>

793
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,960
<i>Darling,
don't make any more excuses!</i>

794
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,720
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

795
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,400
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

796
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,160
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

797
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,840
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

798
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,560
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

799
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,240
<i>His badgering is persistent</i>

800
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,160
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

801
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,120
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

802
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,040
<i>Talks crazy, walks crazy</i>

803
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,720
<i>On cloud-nine in a tizzy</i>

804
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,440
<i>Eager beaver, perfumed and ready</i>

805
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,880
<i>Talks in tricky seductive lies</i>

806
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,640
<i>Sweet talks and calls me baby</i>

807
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,480
<i>Eager beaver, mint breath ready</i>

808
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,760
<i>Puppy eyes, pretends to cry</i>

809
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,520
<i>Avoids my eyes, he nudges sly</i>

810
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,720
<i>Says Honey, come closer to me</i>

811
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,680
<i>His passions overflow, he said</i>

812
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,400
<i>Tonight we're gonna
wrestle in bed</i>

813
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,480
<i>Turn it on and come to me, baby!</i>

814
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,760
<i>Give me a yes, and take my life</i>

815
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,640
<i>Darling,
don't make any more excuses!</i>

816
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,360
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

817
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,000
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

818
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,840
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

819
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,400
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

820
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,160
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

821
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,920
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

822
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,640
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

823
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,240
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

824
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,120
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

825
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,640
<i>His badgering is persistent</i>

826
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,520
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

827
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,360
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

828
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,640
What happened?

829
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,880
Everything okay?

830
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,160
Nakul?

831
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,120
- Say something!
- Okay, you tell me...

832
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,400
Are parents supposed
to be doing all this?

833
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:33,600
"Are you going to sing,
or will you just clap your hands?"

834
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,360
Chhotu, listen!

835
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,440
I'll be back in a moment, Aunty!

836
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,760
He's gotten really spoilt!

837
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,840
What are you saying, Mr. Chopra!

838
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,400
Business isn't that great these days!

839
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,720
Chhotu's here.

840
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,120
Keep the kebabs here.

841
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,120
Aunty doesn't know, right?

842
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,320
- Not at all, Uncle!
- Great.

843
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,400
Go serve them, son.

844
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,840
Uncle.
- Move it!

845
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,960
Jeetu, to tell you the truth...

846
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,320
Sunny's ex-wife had an affair.

847
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,240
What are you saying!

848
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:15,880
She pushed him away, and then divorced
him on false grounds of impotence!

849
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,720
It destroyed
the poor boy's confidence.

850
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,960
Did you take him to a doctor?

851
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,560
We did.

852
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,320
It's been two years
since his second marriage.

853
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,920
Bring some ice.

854
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,520
- We're still waiting to get
some 'good news'! - What?

855
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,920
No good news yet!

856
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,600
He feels shy talking to me.

857
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,440
So I thought,
maybe you could speak to him?

858
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,640
He respects you a lot.

859
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,560
Does he even recognize me?
- Of course!

860
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,840
I only saw him as a baby
during his naming ceremony

861
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
and at his first wedding,
where we barely met for two minutes.

862
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,160
How can I talk to him?

863
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,120
If not you, who else do I ask?

864
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,680
Hey, Chawla, come here!
- Excuse me.

865
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,360
Listen, bring that out.

866
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,720
The stuff that you brought.
- This?

867
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,320
I've known Mr. Sharma
for years now.

868
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,640
What's up!
- Jeetu!

869
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,760
Having fun, eh?

870
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,480
Nice! Look at you,
trying to look like a cool cat!

871
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,480
So while I struggle
to hide my belly...

872
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,360
You'll strut around twirling
your whiskers?

873
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,760
Don't forget, your own sons
are looking down upon you!

874
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,840
What are you staring at?
Shave them off!

875
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
Now!

876
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,360
- Can I keep them until we're in Delhi?
- Do it now.

877
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,400
Didn't your cousin have a moustache
as well? The one who went to Brazil?

878
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,280
Will you say something?

879
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,880
I really want to understand
what your problem is, Nakul.

880
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,760
If you still haven't understood,
there's no point.

881
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,800
Explain it, then!

882
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,680
Do you find it embarrassing
that your parents have sex?

883
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,360
I don't want to discuss this.
Don't you understand?

884
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,720
I don't want to either.

885
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,080
It's just that it's starting
to affect us.

886
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,000
Renee!

887
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,120
What?

888
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,320
What do you want?

889
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,200
Do you want your parents to take
your permission, "Son, can we?"

890
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,280
Okay, I'm confused.

891
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,960
Suppose we get married...

892
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,080
How do you think
we'd be in our 40s and 50s?

893
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,120
What do you mean?

894
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,120
I mean, will we only discuss
our kids' school grades?

895
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,920
Instead of Pink Floyd,
will we listen to devotional songs?

896
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,320
No sex, no romance?

897
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,160
Because if that's your idea
of being married, then count me out.

898
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,240
Honestly, that's not the life I want.

899
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,640
Sorry, sorry.

900
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,440
Here's your mixed popcorn.

901
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,880
You know, when I was six or seven,
I was terrified of the dark.

902
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,680
So I slept between Mom and Dad.

903
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,000
Sometimes, I'd wake up at night
and find them both missing.

904
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,720
I was telling you about Mom and Dad...

905
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,960
- Obviously, they'd be in the next room.
- What?

906
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,840
They'd be in the next room!

907
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,280
I was too young. So I would get scared
and start banging on the door...

908
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,320
Can you imagine?

909
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,040
Mom would always open the door...

910
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,200
And I clearly remember
the look on her face.

911
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:03,760
What?

912
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,800
"Renee, are you fine?"
Dad would never come out.

913
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,520
Some 2-3 years back,
I discussed this with Mom...

914
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,720
And we laughed so hard.
It was so funny!

915
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,400
Man, how can you discuss
all this with your mum?

916
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,160
Girls can discuss anything
with their mothers.

917
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,120
In that case, I'm happy being a guy.

918
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,960
Locking my parents up and banging
on the door isn't my idea of fun!

919
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,240
Very funny...
You aren't as smart as you think.

920
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,520
Otherwise you wouldn't
have been acting so juvenile!

921
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,000
Now I understand
what your problem is...

922
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,880
What is my problem?

923
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,520
You're like a typical Indian man!

924
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,160
Turn your mother into a Goddess.

925
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,640
Put her on a pedestal.

926
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,200
And forget that she's also
a wife and a woman with desires.

927
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,640
Hold on. Don't try
to intellectualize this.

928
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,640
Put yourself in my shoes.

929
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,640
If your mom got pregnant,
you'd know how it feels.

930
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,200
If my mom got pregnant,
it would be a bigger problem...

931
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,880
See!

932
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,840
Yeah... Because my Dad's no more!

933
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,320
Pass the salt!

934
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,840
By the way, have you told your mom?

935
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:29,960
Not yet.

936
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,360
You can tell her yourself.

937
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,920
It's her 50th birthday tomorrow.
There's a party...

938
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,000
And you're my special invitee.

939
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,880
Bye.

940
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,680
You've got to come, okay?

941
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,320
Where did I keep it...

942
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,160
Bro, my tuition fee's due.
Mom left without giving it to me.

943
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,840
"Bro"? Are you okay?

944
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,920
How much?
- 2500 rupees.

945
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,120
Man...

946
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,320
Looking for your phone?

947
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,640
What's it doing with you?

948
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,200
I don't have the cash...

949
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,640
Take my card.

950
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,920
What's the PIN?

951
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,160
Actually, give it back...

952
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,280
Come with me.
We'll pick up cash on the way.

953
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,120
Here.

954
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
What are you doing?

955
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,400
Yeah, coming...

956
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,960
Mom didn't give me
pocket money either.

957
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,120
Hi.

958
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,680
Chhotu, hurry up...

959
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,320
Here. You can clear my tab.

960
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,560
You still owe me a grand!

961
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,120
I've given you 1500, right? I'll pay
the rest too. Give me a samosa.

962
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,800
Fine!

963
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,320
What's up?

964
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,720
Hey, Gular! Come here.

965
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,360
Hi... How are you?

966
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,800
This is for you...

967
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,960
By 10 o'clock, I'm out...
Lights out...

968
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,400
- Without telling me, she...
- Thank you!

969
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,800
Ma, you want something?

970
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,960
Maybe this, later!

971
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,000
I'll just be back in a moment.

972
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,520
You have to try this cake.
It's from this special...

973
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,520
Hello.

974
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
Flowers are allowed today, right?

975
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,040
Come, I'll make you meet Mom.

976
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,760
- Hi, Aunty.
- Hello, son!

977
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,960
Happy Birthday.

978
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,960
Oh thank you, they're gorgeous.
Thank you!

979
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,480
In fact, this party's gorgeous.

980
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,000
That's all her doing.

981
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,440
Who celebrates birthdays
like this when they're 50!

982
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,400
Mom, not again.

983
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,800
I'm not complaining!

984
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,640
Give him some cake...

985
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,200
He doesn't drink, no? So cake?

986
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,320
I do!

987
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,920
Boyfriend?

988
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,320
Don't diet, have the cake.

989
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,320
Okay.

990
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,680
It's not too casual, is it?

991
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,640
How did you get so late?

992
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,800
You got out of office early
saying it's your Mom's birthday.

993
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,400
What excuse could I give,
my sister's wedding?

994
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,720
What date is it?

995
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,440
10th December.

996
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,680
Damn, it's Shanoo's wedding today.

997
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,440
You didn't even call?

998
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,280
<i>Calm down, I have my reasons
for not doing it</i>

999
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,600
<i>I'm wearing so many bangles</i>

1000
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,920
<i>Calm down, I have my reasons
for not doing it</i>

1001
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,520
<i>We shall unite
It's just a matter of one night</i>

1002
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:48,080
<i>I'm wearing so many bangles</i>

1003
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:53,120
<i>Calm down, I have my reasons
for not doing it</i>

1004
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,400
That's Mr. Chawla's son.

1005
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,200
Go ahead, counsel him.

1006
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,720
<i>These bangles are clinking in my hands</i>

1007
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,400
<i>Long nights...</i>

1008
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:30,560
<i>Long nights which are also dark...</i>

1009
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,280
Come. Let's go for the photograph.

1010
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:39,200
<i>Don't listen to your naughty bangles</i>

1011
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,320
<i>Long and dark nights!</i>

1012
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,800
Shanoo, I'm so sorry. I really am!

1013
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,120
Say sorry all you want. When you
get married, I won't attend either!

1014
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,600
I just got stuck
with some office work...

1015
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,680
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1016
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,520
Okay listen, your mom's here.
Speak to her.

1017
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,440
It's Nakul...
- Nakul?

1018
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,160
Hello?

1019
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,880
The call disconnected...

1020
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,240
- Excuse me. Do you have a charger?
- Yeah.

1021
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,240
My phone just died.

1022
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,600
I'll put it on charge. Excuse me.

1023
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,560
Sure.

1024
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,280
- Nakul.
- Ron. How are you?

1025
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,320
I'm good.

1026
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,760
Shanoo, Granny...

1027
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,800
God bless you.

1028
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,920
You're going to America, right?
Stay happy.

1029
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,320
Granny, I'll call you from there!

1030
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,800
It's okay, my child.

1031
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,320
None of you bothered
to call me from Meerut...

1032
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,120
How will you keep
in touch from America?

1033
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,320
It'll be too much trouble.

1034
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,680
Start the band!

1035
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,480
Play the music!

1036
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,440
At least let me give her my blessings!

1037
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,320
Why don't you relax, Ma?
- Let me give her blessings.

1038
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,320
Let's go, dear.

1039
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,200
What did I say wrong?
- Stop it, Mom!

1040
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,240
You can talk later.
Let's proceed now.

1041
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,520
Let's never invite the Sethis again.

1042
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,440
They guzzled down all the wine!

1043
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,960
Did you see him staring at his wife?

1044
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,760
Kundan Singh!
Put out the candles.

1045
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,680
Sure, madam.

1046
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,120
Can't host these parties anymore.
It's too much.

1047
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,960
Mom. I need to talk to you.

1048
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,800
She's what?

1049
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,720
How?

1050
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,800
I think, how it usually happens.

1051
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,640
So you think this is a joke?

1052
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,000
It's no big deal, Mom.

1053
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,600
"It's no big deal"?

1054
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,640
My God!

1055
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,760
How can people be so careless!

1056
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,520
No, I understand, I mean...

1057
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,440
"A moment of passion" and all, but...

1058
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,680
What about later?
How can you not take any precautions?

1059
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,680
Okay so, when they found out...

1060
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,920
Was there time?

1061
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,280
I'm not sure, but maybe there was.

1062
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,640
Oh God...

1063
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,560
Well I don't know
what to say then, Renee!

1064
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,240
"Maybe there was?"

1065
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,600
God, it's embarrassing
to say the least, isn't it?

1066
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,120
And the health risk?
Did they consider it?

1067
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,720
And the financial strain...

1068
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,000
Especially when they're
close to retirement!

1069
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,560
And it's not like
they're so well off...

1070
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,200
Heights!

1071
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,160
Do you realize who is going
to bear the strain of all this?

1072
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,600
- Ma...
- Nakul will be trapped in this mess.

1073
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,760
Renee, if you're thinking
of a life with him...

1074
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,000
Then have no doubt - this kid
is going to be your responsibility.

1075
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,040
Mom!

1076
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Look Renee,
I'm not saying Nakul's a bad guy.

1077
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,360
He's a nice boy.

1078
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,080
But his family, my God...

1079
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,320
You know, his family is a circus
I don't want to buy tickets to!

1080
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,080
It's just so... It's just so uncouth,
all this!

1081
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,000
Can you imagine something like
this happening in families like ours?

1082
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,160
Come on, Mom!
You're being really harsh.

1083
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,680
Okay, but...

1084
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,720
You're all I have, Renee.

1085
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,160
Nothing matters more
to me than your happiness.

1086
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,960
But think about it...

1087
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,600
Would you be able to fit
into a family like theirs?

1088
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,560
They won't even let
their son move to the US.

1089
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,760
Won't they interfere in your life?
- Mom!

1090
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,600
And now they definitely
won't let him go...

1091
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,280
Because who'll provide
for them otherwise?

1092
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,320
I had forgotten my phone.

1093
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,800
- Aunty, just a minute.
- Nakul!

1094
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,960
- No...
- Please.

1095
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,080
I'm sorry, Aunty.

1096
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,480
You were saying such nice things about
my family... I just eavesdropped.

1097
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,160
Then again - in families like ours,
listening in on others is quite normal.

1098
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,160
It is normal, yeah.

1099
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,120
In fact, I'm glad I heard
what you said.

1100
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,760
I just realized that I was
pointlessly getting embarrassed

1101
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,200
about Mom's pregnancy.

1102
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,800
Why bother?

1103
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,760
After all, our family's already
such an embarrassment!

1104
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,280
That's what you said, right?

1105
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,160
Not a family but... What was the word?

1106
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,040
Circus. Circus!

1107
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,520
Nakul, don't do this. You're drunk.

1108
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,280
At least let me talk.

1109
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,600
Is this the way to talk?

1110
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,600
Well, that's how we talk
in my family, isn't it?

1111
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,040
We're a nosy bunch.

1112
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,480
By the way, about the interference...
You were bang on!

1113
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,640
My parents have issues
with me going to the US...

1114
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,160
I have issues
with their relationship...

1115
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,640
After all, what kind of a man
loves his wife- it's so not classy!

1116
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,080
Better flirt with the
neighbour's wife, right?

1117
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,200
Oh please...

1118
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,360
Just a minute, Aunty-
I'm not done yet.

1119
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,360
Nakul, don't misbehave.

1120
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,240
It's okay, let him speak.

1121
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,160
Hmm.

1122
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,040
So kind of you, Aunty.

1123
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:27,560
You said I'm a "nice guy"... Right?

1124
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,680
That's where you got it
a little wrong.

1125
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,640
If I were a nice guy,
I would've stood by my parents.

1126
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,040
If I were a nice guy,
I would've been happy for the baby.

1127
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,400
Because I know my parents will
give it all the love in the world.

1128
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,440
And for whatever else it needs,
I'll be there.

1129
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,760
Because whether it's a brother
or a sister, it'll be mine.

1130
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,840
Done?

1131
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,920
Yeah... I guess.

1132
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,360
That's all for now.

1133
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,640
I'll email you the rest.

1134
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,320
I'll take down your ID.

1135
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,360
Goodnight, Aunty.

1136
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,720
Bye.

1137
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,200
Nakul...

1138
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,000
Nakul!

1139
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,040
You can't talk to my mom like this.

1140
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,000
Why? Why can't I?

1141
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,720
After all she said about my family,
why should I keep quiet?

1142
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,560
She was talking to me, not to you.

1143
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,080
How does it matter?

1144
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,960
That's what she really thinks
of my family, isn't it?

1145
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,360
You've got to apologize to her.

1146
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,920
Balls.

1147
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,680
Don't do this, Nakul.

1148
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,520
I'm telling you.

1149
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,680
Yeah, I heard you.

1150
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,720
Now what?

1151
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,720
Have you gone deaf? I've been
ringing the bell since half an hour!

1152
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,520
I'm not a doorman!

1153
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,040
Shut up, or you'll get it from me!
I'm already pissed.

1154
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,280
Go ahead.

1155
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,200
Hit me!

1156
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,880
Show me.
What's that under your eye?

1157
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,320
Who did it? Tell me...

1158
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,720
Will you tell me or not!

1159
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,200
There's this guy at school.
Sumit Malik.

1160
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,880
Hey, Gular! Come here.

1161
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,600
What's this I'm hearing?
You should talk to your Dad, dude...

1162
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,080
At this ripe old age... He's
still dirty dancing with your mom?

1163
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,560
Speak up!

1164
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,400
Should he be doing it
with your mom, then?

1165
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,240
You've got neither brains, nor balls!

1166
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,240
Look at your face!
Couldn't even put up a fight...

1167
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,520
Come. Let's go to his place
and beat the shit out of him!

1168
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,520
What about the other guys
who were there?

1169
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,160
The thing you told that guy...

1170
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,520
I said the same thing to someone else.

1171
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,320
Not that Dad's left us
with much to say.

1172
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,480
Is that why you're drinking?

1173
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,920
Will you have some?

1174
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,960
I could try it...

1175
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,560
You want to drink, you son of a gun?

1176
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,040
Don't get my Dad into it!

1177
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,120
Why, is he only your Dad?

1178
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,320
Is he not my Dad too?

1179
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,840
"Don't get my Dad into it!"

1180
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,120
Enough is enough, Gular...

1181
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,800
No more hiding.

1182
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,360
How about you...

1183
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:47,480
How about you go to my...
Daddy.

1184
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,160
Daddy.

1185
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,600
How about you go to my Daddy!

1186
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,480
Hey Nandu, rub lime on it, dude!

1187
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,600
I didn't like it.

1188
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,560
Hey there, big boy!

1189
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:11,800
You're Sumit Malik, right?

1190
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,000
Yeah, you got a problem?

1191
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,600
Don't you hang out with Rathi,
the student leader?

1192
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,800
Yeah.

1193
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,640
He's a chatty fellow, isn't he?

1194
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,200
Didn't he ever tell you
about Nakul Kaushik?

1195
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,960
Didn't he mention how many skulls
we cracked in our school years?

1196
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,600
You know he's my brother, right?

1197
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,440
Actually, I...

1198
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,000
Does Rathi know you hit him?

1199
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,160
I stopped getting into fights
only cause Mom said so.

1200
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,120
But you're talking shit
about my parents!

1201
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,320
Itching to get into trouble?

1202
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,400
Gular, come hit him.

1203
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,480
Sorry, bro!

1204
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,800
- And his cap must fly off.
- Sorry, bro!

1205
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,600
Didn't cut it.

1206
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,800
Give me the bag.

1207
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,120
He won't mind. He's a cooperative kid.

1208
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:26,120
Look Gular... If his cap
doesn't come off this time...

1209
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,720
I'm gonna thrash him, and you too.

1210
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,960
Hit him!

1211
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:32,960
Lower your hand!

1212
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,720
Bro... Did I hit him hard?

1213
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,320
His ears must be still ringing.

1214
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,080
- Tell me something.
- What?

1215
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,360
Have you thought about it...

1216
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,560
Whether it'll be a boy or a girl?

1217
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,600
Not really. What about you?

1218
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,720
Me neither.
What's the point, anyway...

1219
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,000
Did you ever imagine
we'd be discussing this!

1220
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,280
Hey! Hey Nakul, Nakul!

1221
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,080
Come on, here!

1222
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,400
He's here, finally!

1223
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,000
How are you?

1224
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,520
Congratulations and celebrations...

1225
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,960
Congrats, big brother!

1226
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,280
You went into hiding, dude!

1227
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,600
Yeah man!

1228
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,040
At least celebrate
the good news with your friends!

1229
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,160
Why keep it all to yourself, eh?

1230
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,120
After all, happiness multiplies
when it's shared, right?

1231
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,760
- Absolutely!
- Am I right?

1232
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,800
Uncle! Have you congratulated
our friend Nakul yet?

1233
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,120
What for?

1234
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,560
Our buddy Nakul is going
to be a big brother again!

1235
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,600
Congratulations, sir!

1236
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,400
Go on, Junney, roast me.

1237
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,440
What are you looking at, rascals!

1238
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,440
Junney's proven this today...

1239
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,160
Among all of you, he's my best friend.

1240
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,480
My dearest!

1241
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,040
Look at him...
He's so happy about the baby!

1242
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:37,120
Even though he can never
father one himself!

1243
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,000
It's okay, Junney, don't worry...

1244
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,760
You're like a brother to me!

1245
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,960
When you get married...
Send your wife to me.

1246
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,160
Actually, you don't need me...

1247
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,760
How about you go to my Daddy?

1248
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:08,800
Uncle, make him a sweet paan!

1249
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,120
Have a seat!

1250
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,120
What are you drinking?

1251
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,040
Cumin water.

1252
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,240
Oh yes, tea causes acidity.

1253
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,280
Here, take your pick.

1254
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,880
He took me to Delhi
to shop for saris.

1255
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,720
But they were too dull.
I didn't like any of them.

1256
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,320
We bought these from the local store.

1257
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,400
Look, how lovely they are!

1258
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,560
I've already chosen mine.

1259
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,480
Ma!

1260
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,200
Ma!

1261
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,880
This is for you!

1262
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:56,280
Why, Priyam, are they not
classy enough for your taste?

1263
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,320
No, Sister-in-law, it's not like that...

1264
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,640
No, it's okay...

1265
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,360
You've turned very modern
living in the big city, haven't you?

1266
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,440
Everyone was talking
about you at the wedding.

1267
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,320
Look, Priyam, we're past
the age to taunt and bicker.

1268
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,440
But you should have thought
about the family's reputation, no?

1269
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,600
Even Shanoo's mother-in-law
asked me about Priyam...

1270
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,560
Unbelievable!
- I was so embarrassed!

1271
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,120
You need to think of how
it would impact the kids...

1272
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,720
What people would say...

1273
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,640
The boys didn't turn up for their
sister's wedding out of shame!

1274
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,680
And what values will they receive?

1275
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,840
Ah! You're one to talk
about values, Guddan!

1276
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,520
Don't values tell you
to take care of your old parents?

1277
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,280
Did you do it?

1278
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,720
And you, sitting there
like a high priestess!

1279
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,680
Tell me, do you even know
what medicines I take?

1280
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,920
In fact, do you even know
about my ailments?

1281
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,800
Last year, when I was in hospital...

1282
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,280
Did any of you visit?

1283
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,960
Ma, we did come once...

1284
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,400
Wow, I should be eternally grateful!

1285
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:22,600
When I was sick, crapping and pissing
in bed, were any of you there?

1286
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,720
She was there.
She took care of everything!

1287
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,800
Let it go, Ma.

1288
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,880
Shut up!

1289
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,240
She washed and bathed me,
cleaned my bed...

1290
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,000
Got a folding bed and stayed
with me all night...

1291
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,760
And you'll teach her about values!

1292
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:47,640
I've come here after so many years...

1293
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,640
Did any of you even ask

1294
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,320
if I'd like to stay on
for a few days after the wedding?

1295
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,320
And you talk about family!

1296
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,680
She's selflessly cared for
our family and never uttered a word!

1297
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,040
Enough, Ma...

1298
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,120
Let me speak, Priyamvada!

1299
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,280
Very concerned about Nakul
and Gular, are you?

1300
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,720
I say, it's good they didn't
come for the wedding!

1301
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,680
Listen! Ma's exploding inside. Hurry!

1302
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,600
What happened?

1303
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,400
Is it a crime for a husband
and wife to be in love?

1304
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,920
- No, tell me!
- Ma!

1305
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,880
Now that Shanoo's married

1306
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,680
in a year you'll start
pestering her to have a baby!

1307
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:42,760
Are babies born out of thin air?

1308
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,360
Without having sexy?

1309
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,960
Aunty, it's not 'sexy', it's sex!

1310
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,640
Who the hell are you? Get lost!

1311
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,440
Take him away!

1312
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,920
Ma, what are you doing...

1313
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,360
The atmosphere will be ruined...

1314
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,920
Sister, you both go... I'll speak to Ma.

1315
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,920
It's her medication...
It gets to her head.

1316
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,520
Sister-in-law, calm down...

1317
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,920
Ma, at such an occasion...
Why spoil the festive mood?

1318
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:19,120
Ask her... Did I start it?

1319
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,080
Ever since I came here,
I've been noticing their attitude.

1320
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,800
And today,
Guddan questioned Priyamvada's values!

1321
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,080
Ma, how does it matter what she says?

1322
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,960
No, Jeetu! Listen to me.

1323
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:36,160
Yes, I'm listening. Please calm down.
Sit, relax and tell me.

1324
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,640
Your father - may
his soul rest in peace...

1325
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,600
He didn't make one
good decision in his life...

1326
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,400
He got you engaged
without my approval...

1327
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,840
Ma...

1328
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:01,520
But luckily, God guided him...

1329
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,040
And made sure he left
someone to take care of me...

1330
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:12,040
Such a wonderful daughter-in-law...

1331
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,160
I've never praised her before...

1332
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,760
But I had to say it today.

1333
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:32,840
Jeetu, take me back home.

1334
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:40,640
And don't you dare hold
a grudge against my grandsons!

1335
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,080
Absolutely not, Ma. No grudges.

1336
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,320
You calm down, please. Okay?

1337
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,080
- Will you have some water?
- Yes.

1338
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,400
- I'll get you water.
- Okay.

1339
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,400
Sit down.

1340
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,680
God bless you.

1341
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,080
You get a live feed directly
on your smartphones.

1342
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,280
In a nutshell,
what we are saying is that

1343
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,720
with Godrej's Eve-home cams,
you can watch over your loved ones

1344
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,360
from anywhere, at any time.

1345
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,760
Fabulous. Works for me. Guys?

1346
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,920
Yeah, fine.

1347
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,640
So, the campaign's final...

1348
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,040
Let's all go out for a drink?

1349
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,040
Sure, sure.

1350
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,560
Renee?

1351
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,920
Not today. I have some work.

1352
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,360
Listen...

1353
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,920
Is there some tension
between you guys?

1354
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,760
See you guys.

1355
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,080
You're coming to the party, right?

1356
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:55,680
Mom and Dad are back.

1357
01:28:58,960 --> 01:28:59,960
Where's Mom?

1358
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:31,880
Mom?

1359
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:42,800
Have you eaten, son?

1360
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,760
Go, meet your Grandma and Dad.

1361
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:37,080
Bless you, my son.

1362
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,560
Your mother was so stressed,
she didn't smile the entire wedding.

1363
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,200
Ma, your medicine.
I'll get you some water.

1364
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,080
Dad...

1365
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:56,560
Sorry.

1366
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,520
See, your father's such a softie
inside! A true poet.

1367
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,920
He's taken after you, Grandma.

1368
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,480
Yeah, and they look so alike too.

1369
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,600
The only difference is the moustache.

1370
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,840
But your Dad doesn't even
have a moustache!

1371
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,400
But you do, Grandma!

1372
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,200
The heartbeat's completely normal.

1373
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,480
Perfectly healthy baby.

1374
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,560
It's getting cold...

1375
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,600
Are you Malayali?

1376
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,520
Are you having a baby too?

1377
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,200
Good, very good!

1378
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,400
You're at the right age.

1379
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,240
We got a little late!

1380
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,080
7 months, 2 weeks...

1381
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,360
Actually, also 2 minutes.

1382
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,760
Just kidding!

1383
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,920
What about you?

1384
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:28,760
No, actually...

1385
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,200
Nakul! Let's go, son.

1386
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,200
Yes, Mom.

1387
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,440
We're not so late, actually...

1388
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,960
We can still pay the installments
on our house.

1389
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,520
Looks good, right?

1390
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:06,840
Is she kicking?

1391
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,560
How can you say it's a she?
It could be a boy as well.

1392
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,200
It's going to be a girl.

1393
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,240
How do you know?

1394
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,160
Are you happy?

1395
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,360
Extremely.

1396
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,880
- Nakul?
- Yes?

1397
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,200
Son... Renee and you
don't go together anymore?

1398
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,320
No.

1399
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,120
<i>My beloved...</i>

1400
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:05,880
<i>My beloved...</i>

1401
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:18,200
<i>Without you beside me
My days and nights feel lifeless</i>

1402
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:23,880
<i>My beloved...</i>

1403
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:30,080
<i>Emptiness fills up
My promised destinies</i>

1404
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,840
<i>My beloved...</i>

1405
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:41,880
<i>Without you beside me
My days and nights feel lifeless</i>

1406
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:47,200
<i>Emptiness fills up
My promised destinies</i>

1407
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:52,640
<i>As we walk together to eternity</i>

1408
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:59,840
<i>As we walk together to eternity
Don't turn and leave midway</i>

1409
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:05,360
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1410
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:10,840
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1411
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:16,760
<i>Please, for the love of God</i>

1412
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:23,160
<i>Please, for the love of God
Don't break my heart this way</i>

1413
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:29,360
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1414
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:35,040
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1415
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,680
<i>My beloved...</i>

1416
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,880
<i>For the ones marred by separation</i>

1417
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,640
<i>Tears rain down those eyes</i>

1418
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,600
<i>The one who has loved and lost</i>

1419
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:01,560
<i>Keeps searching for his path forever</i>

1420
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,760
<i>The one with a broken heart</i>

1421
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,800
<i>The one with a broken heart</i>

1422
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,600
<i>Searches for its missing part</i>

1423
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:19,280
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1424
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,960
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1425
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:30,960
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1426
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:36,760
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1427
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:43,280
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1428
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:51,640
<i>Don't fall in love with someone else</i>

1429
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,560
Not getting sleep?

1430
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,360
Want to take a stroll?

1431
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,360
You guys had a fight, didn't you?

1432
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,480
You should apologize.

1433
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,960
Why should I apologize, tell me?

1434
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,320
She's bound to be upset, isn't it?

1435
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,800
If someone spoke to me that way,
wouldn't you be angry?

1436
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,040
But then it'll look
like I was at fault.

1437
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,680
There's no point being adamant, son.

1438
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,640
You'll keep holding onto this,
and she'll move on to someone else.

1439
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:04,360
If you can't do it, tell me...
I'll speak to her.

1440
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,640
Listen to me.

1441
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,600
The baby shower's coming soon.
Go give them an invitation.

1442
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,240
So...

1443
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,960
Should I give her the card
in office tomorrow?

1444
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,120
Aunty, well...

1445
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,200
I don't really know where to begin.

1446
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,560
So let me just start by saying sorry.

1447
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,280
I'm genuinely extremely sorry, Aunty.

1448
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:05,520
I don't know if me coming here and
apologizing makes any difference...

1449
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,800
Renee and I haven't been
on talking terms lately.

1450
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,120
The way I spoke to you that night,
it's not done...

1451
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,400
I'm really embarrassed about it.

1452
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I don't want Renee to feel
embarrassed because of me.

1453
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,400
I don't want her to feel ashamed
about introducing me to you.

1454
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,960
I know she's disappointed in me.

1455
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,880
And that's why I'm here to apologize.

1456
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,960
I'm not such a bad guy, Aunty...

1457
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,880
And my family, my parents...
They're also not bad people.

1458
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:04,520
They're very simple, normal, genuine
people with middle-class values.

1459
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,960
They're good human beings.

1460
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,520
And I really hope I become
like them one day.

1461
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,120
Anyhow, this is for you.

1462
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,120
The Baby Shower invite.

1463
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,880
Actually, mom wanted to give it to you
personally, but you know, she's...

1464
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,040
So Aunty

1465
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,320
if you can forgive me,
please do come.

1466
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,320
And if possible,
get Renee along as well.

1467
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,760
I need to say sorry to her too.

1468
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,040
Thanks for hearing me out.

1469
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:56,960
I'll take your leave.

1470
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:58,920
Bye.

1471
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,560
Straighten it!

1472
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,080
Upstairs, on the first floor.
- Okay, sir.

1473
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,080
Gular!

1474
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,480
The wires are getting tangled.

1475
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,280
Move it to the side...
Yeah, that's it.

1476
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,240
Switch it on.

1477
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:30,840
- Is it fine?
- Perfect.

1478
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,600
Carefully...

1479
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,960
Jeetu...

1480
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:41,120
Now my only prayer to God
is that you have a boy.

1481
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,840
The holy trinity will be complete.

1482
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,320
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva!

1483
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,920
Do either of them
look like a God to you?

1484
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,120
They're little demons, your grandsons!

1485
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,920
Hush! What nonsense!

1486
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,240
Ma, whether it's a boy or a girl...
It should be healthy.

1487
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,040
And to tell you the truth...

1488
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,240
I'm hoping for a daughter this time.

1489
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,880
Babli?

1490
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:27,480
Wait, wait, stop!

1491
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,800
What's happening?

1492
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,800
Doctor...

1493
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,200
- Jeetu, what happened?
- One minute... Nakul!

1494
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,560
Come here quickly, son!

1495
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,440
How's Nakul?

1496
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:49,360
Fine, I guess.

1497
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,680
Why, you guys don't meet in office?

1498
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,240
No.

1499
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,720
Because of his mom...
He often works from home.

1500
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,520
He was here this afternoon.

1501
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,720
He spoke less today...

1502
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,480
But he spoke well.

1503
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,960
Like I always said...

1504
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,200
He's not a bad guy.

1505
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,080
In fact, he's rather nice.

1506
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:31,200
Are you going to keep staring
at my face, or will you call him now?

1507
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,000
Carefully, down the stairs...

1508
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,680
What are you standing there for?
Open the door!

1509
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,400
Carefully...

1510
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,840
Keep your right foot first...

1511
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:54,960
Hurry up!

1512
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,200
What are you doing?
Sit at the back with mom! I'll drive.

1513
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,000
- Son...
- Take me too!

1514
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:00,920
You get Grandma and come.

1515
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,520
Why do we need Grandma there?

1516
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,480
Why don't you tell her that!

1517
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,960
Babli, is everything okay?

1518
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,640
Nakul, keep me posted!

1519
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:13,800
He's not picking up his phone.
I'll go see him.

1520
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,600
- Nakul, drive faster.
- Yes, Dad.

1521
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:34,440
Babli? Don't worry...
We're almost there.

1522
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,520
I'm scared...

1523
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:39,800
It's going to be fine.
We'll be there any minute.

1524
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:51,400
Carefully...

1525
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,880
Take it easy on the turn!

1526
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,960
- Babli, it's okay...
- Wait, I'll open the door.

1527
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,800
Hold it from there.
Carefully...

1528
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,520
Stay out, I'll check.

1529
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,360
- Are you here to meet Nakul, dear?
- Yes.

1530
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,400
He just took his mother
to the hospital.

1531
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,280
Thank you, Aunty!

1532
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,920
I've filled the form,
I'll make the payment.

1533
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,080
Nakul! Where's Mom?

1534
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,320
She's in the emergency ward.
It'll take some time. You please sit.

1535
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:33,760
Dad!

1536
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:36,280
Is everything fine?

1537
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,320
Her water just broke.

1538
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,080
The senior doctor is on her way.

1539
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,720
They say they need to operate.

1540
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,200
Operation?

1541
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,240
- What did she say?
- Nothing...

1542
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,120
- Tell me!
- It's nothing important.

1543
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,320
Come on, tell me!

1544
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,720
She was asking if you want to go
and shoot a video of the delivery.

1545
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,480
Shameless!

1546
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,440
How can you suggest something
like this to your father?

1547
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,440
- People do it nowadays.
- What rubbish!

1548
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:20,680
Mom!

1549
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,520
- Who's that?
- Nakul's chick!

1550
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:27,560
I mean, his friend.

1551
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,480
Congratulations... It's a baby girl.

1552
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,680
We were a bit concerned
because the baby was premature

1553
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:51,360
but she's absolutely healthy.
Absolutely fine.

1554
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,920
The mother's doing fine too.

1555
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,480
We'll shift both of them
to the ward shortly.

1556
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:12,880
Babli?

1557
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:35,400
How are you feeling?

1558
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,040
I'm fine.

1559
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,120
How does our little doll look?

1560
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,680
She's coming. See her for yourself.

1561
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,160
<i>Holding you warm in my arms</i>

1562
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:23,920
<i>I'll pamper you with endless love</i>

1563
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:30,560
<i>May you have the brightest dreams</i>

1564
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:35,320
<i>As I sing you sweet lullabies</i>

1565
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:43,360
<i>I pray that you live a hundred years</i>

1566
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:48,480
<i>I pray that you live a hundred years</i>

1567
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:52,400
<i>And upon myself I'll take your pain</i>

1568
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,240
<i>Holding you warm in my arms</i>

1569
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:09,840
<i>I'll pamper you with endless love</i>

1570
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:16,360
<i>May you have the brightest dreams</i>

1571
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:21,520
<i>As I sing you sweet lullabies</i>

1572
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,960
Come Nakul, let's take a selfie.

1573
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,040
Renee dear, come join us.

1574
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,440
Come.

1575
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:27,880
Jeetu... Now that we're in hospital,
you might as well get operated too...

1576
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,720
Or we might end up here
again next year!

1577
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:35,880
<i>Congrats, Missus,
congrats to you!</i>

1578
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,840
<i>Congrats, Missus,
congrats to you!</i>

1579
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,960
<i>To the Fam, to the Gran,
to the Daddy and his clan...</i>

1580
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,280
<i>- Congratulations to them!
- No, never!</i>

1581
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,640
