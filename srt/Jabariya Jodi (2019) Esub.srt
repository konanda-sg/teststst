00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
I swear I will leave
my Navodaya School Scholarship

3
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,240
if she gives looks
at you even once. Promise.

4
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Listen. This is my
first attendance in her class.

5
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,160
If she doesn't end up kissing on my
cheeks, then my name isn't Abhay Singh.

6
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,880
"None of my promises
were ever fulfilled."

7
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,800
"What is my fault?"
"What is my fault?"

8
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,600
"Even though I won,
my dreams lost."

9
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,600
"What is this madness?"
"What is this madness?"

10
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,080
"This crazy world
doesn't understand love."

11
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,320
"The crazy world doesn't
understand love."

12
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,160
"This heart only recognizes
someone like itself."

13
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,440
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

14
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,400
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

15
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,120
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

16
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,120
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

17
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,800
"How do I make you explain."

18
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,800
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

19
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,240
"No one knows except
for my heart"

20
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,160
"sooner or later we
will be together forever."

21
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,960
"No one knows except
for my heart"

22
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,000
"sooner or later we
will be together forever."

23
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,080
"People are crazy
for they taunt me."

24
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,280
"People are crazy
for they taunt me."

25
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,120
"This heart only recognizes
someone like itself."

26
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,440
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

27
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,520
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

28
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Let's make a wild guess.

29
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,400
Just name your price.

30
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,520
Don't be shy.

31
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,480
How about a piece of land?

32
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
Come closer.

33
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,040
I have a question, mother.

34
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,320
Father stays away from
home for days in a row.

35
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,640
You know everything
that goes down there.

36
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,880
Father isn't being
fair with you at all.

37
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,160
Who am I not being fair to?

38
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,000
What is cooking
between mother and son?

39
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,160
Listen, I am leaving
for Aarah tomorrow.

40
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,160
I've put clothes out to wash.

41
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,320
Why soil them in the first place?

42
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,080
Don't try to be a wise guy.

43
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,160
Bravo, my boy.

44
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you doing?
- Listen.

45
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,480
Babli is leaving for
Patna tomorrow for good.

46
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
Won't you meet her?

47
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,080
Will see.

48
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,880
"How do I make you explain."

49
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,320
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

50
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,440
"Whenever you're upset with me..."

51
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,920
"I will be heartbroken."

52
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,320
"I will be heartbroken.
I'll renounce this world"

53
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,240
"whenever you're upset with me."

54
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,400
"The world's crazy."

55
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,240
"Crazy is its people."

56
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,000
You are crying.

57
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,560
It's not easy to make me crazy.

58
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Wait.

59
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,360
Uncle, I've come
asking for Babli's hand.

60
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,640
Do you want one or both?

61
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,440
After all the risk I've taken,
I would prefer both.

62
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,280
Why doesn't someone get rid of him?

63
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,400
Take that...

64
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,680
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

65
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,120
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

66
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,360
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

67
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,560
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

68
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,680
"I wonder..."

69
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,680
"Bomb-Bomb-Bomb-Bomb..."

70
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,600
"Babli Bomb..."

71
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,360
"Pink cheeks, high heels.
You are an amazing girl."

72
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,520
"Curly hair."

73
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
"But you have a killer sway.
Watch where you step."

74
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,160
"We've been waiting
to catch a glimpse."

75
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,120
"What an amazing girl!
Amazing style!"

76
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,440
"Even your nose ring's amazing."

77
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
"You are a complete illusion.
You are a complete illusion."

78
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,400
"You can kill with
just your looks."

79
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,440
"Bomb-Bomb-Bomb-Bomb..."

80
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
"Babli Bomb..."

81
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,760
"Bomb-Bomb-Bomb-Bomb..."

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,400
"Babli Bomb..."

83
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,120
I am coming, Santo.

84
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,840
Hold on to your horses.

85
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,480
Are you crazy?

86
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
This is my second
attempt at running.

87
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,920
The first was in school,
in a race,

88
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
where I lost.

89
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,080
This time I am running
away to get married.

90
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,400
So take care.

91
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,480
The guy, I mean.

92
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,240
I always take care of myself.

93
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
Look after yourself
and that Duniya Lal as well.

94
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,120
Santosh,
where are you going at this hour?

95
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Where to?

96
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,200
Uncle, hear me out first.

97
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,360
She never listened to you
why do think she will listen to me.

98
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,680
You can hit me if you like,
but please stop staring at me.

99
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
Santo.

100
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
Yes, I am running away with Santo.

101
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,160
No.
She is lying, uncle.

102
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,760
I love him,
and we are getting married too.

103
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,480
No, Babli.
- I am running away with him.

104
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,200
And you are free to
do what you feel is right.

105
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,600
She is lying, uncle.
There is no such plan.

106
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
Are you crazy.

107
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,480
You always lose your
mind when you're worried.

108
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,040
You have known since you were
a kid that he walks in his sleep.

109
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,240
Let me take him back.

110
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,480
Let's go.

111
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,200
Santo, take proper
care of Duniya Lal.

112
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,800
Give him his pills on time and
check his blood pressure regularly.

113
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,640
Only in Bihar can a guy
be so diversely multitasking.

114
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,360
Take care of yourself.

115
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,120
I have Ravi for that.

116
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,040
Yes.
He is a nice guy.

117
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,000
And handsome too.

118
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, we'll have handsome children.

119
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,280
Like Baby Taimur.

120
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,320
Taimur who?

121
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,960
Saif's kid.

122
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,120
Saif who?

123
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,360
My aunt's son.
- Your aunt...

124
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,680
Let it be, Santo,
not your cup of tea.

125
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,840
Okay.

126
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,080
Now listen.

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,000
I won't tell anyone
where you two are going.

128
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
I believe you more than
I believe myself, Santo.

129
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,320
Stop calling me Santo.
I am a male, not a female.

130
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,320
Santosh Pathak.

131
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
Fine.

132
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,440
How about a few lines
since I am leaving?

133
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,680
"We were parting ways like..."

134
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,280
"My final breath leaving my body."

135
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,720
Bravo. Bravo.

136
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,080
At least now show that you care.

137
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,560
I will call you
once I reach Kolkata.

138
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,360
I know you won't.

139
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,440
Three people on the same
bike and without a helmet.

140
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,800
It's a trust-building exercise.
Don't worry, we will find Babli.

141
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,600
I know the Inspector personally.

142
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,360
I know he must have helped her.

143
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,320
He has been following
my daughter like bad luck.

144
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,560
Stupid.

145
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,280
Say something.
- Of course.

146
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,920
Take a detour if you
see a betel leaf shop.

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,960
My daughter's missing and you can't
stop thinking about betel leaf.

148
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
Hello.

149
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,880
Don't forget this is Patna.

150
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
You don't get it.

151
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh man.

152
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,320
What do you think you're doing?

153
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,840
Not you, sir.
The people here are so...

154
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,160
Sir, what time is
the train to Aarah?

155
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
Shut up and get lost.

156
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
The people here are so stubborn,
it's hard to find any breaking news.

157
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,160
Frankly speaking, sir...

158
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,640
Two things about India, Bihar and
Aadhar, is beyond my understanding.

159
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,440
Stop it.

160
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,320
No one knows how
deep their roots spread.

161
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,640
You should send
me to Delhi instead.

162
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,400
We'll have breaking news
even if some Minister sneezes.

163
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,120
I swear I will manage out there.

164
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,680
I will stay in Patel Nagar.

165
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,280
I will quit chewing tobacco.

166
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
Believe me,
we will get our breaking news...

167
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,520
Deepak Chaurasiya.

168
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,840
Excuse me.
Bakabhai Tandiya, from Rajkot.

169
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Yes, sir. Please just...

170
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,720
How about breakup news instead?

171
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,880
What?

172
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,280
I have sensational
breakup news for you.

173
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,720
But who broke up?

174
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,080
Babli Yadav!

175
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,160
What the hell is this?
Its has no taste.

176
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,520
Leaving it unfinished.

177
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,520
After betraying the girl in love,

178
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,840
the boy's relishing on
'litti chokha' roadside food.

179
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,640
When you had no guts,

180
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,040
then why did you
say let's run away?

181
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,520
Babli, show some respect.

182
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
We live in a cruel world.

183
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,960
The girl's heart is shattered.

184
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,600
And the guy is showing attitude.

185
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
What will this poor girl...

186
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,720
Babli, what are you doing?

187
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,160
She let him have it.

188
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,720
Are you crazy.

189
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,080
What are you doing?

190
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,680
Another one!

191
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,080
"Babli. Babli Babli bomb."

192
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,400
"Babli bomb!"

193
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,040
Hit him, Babli!

194
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,960
Hit him!

195
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,680
"Here Babli, there Babli.
Everywhere you look there's Babli."

196
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,240
Running after her
cheating boyfriend...

197
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,080
He made her a puppet of his hand.

198
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,560
"Little water, more rum."

199
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,960
"Babli Bomb..."
- Hit him, Babli.

200
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,520
"Babli Bomb..."
- Hit him, Babli.

201
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,560
"Babli Bomb..."
- Hit him, Babli.

202
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,480
"Babli Bomb..."
- Hit him, Babli.

203
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,080
Babli, you hit him a lot
worse than my wife hits me.

204
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,960
But believe me when I say
that you have everyone's support.

205
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,880
She isn't Babli Yadav.
She is Babli Bomb.

206
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Long Live Babli!

207
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
Hey! Mukesh just
topped the class. Brother!

208
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,640
Really? Is it true?

209
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,760
You were unbelievable.

210
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,760
You achieved the impossible.

211
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,520
Long live...
- Brother Mukesh.

212
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,280
Long live...
- Brother Mukesh.

213
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,480
Long live...
- Brother Mukesh.

214
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,440
Boys, this calls for a dance.

215
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,320
The wedding procession's
coming this way.

216
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,640
won't you do this
little thing for us?

217
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,920
Watch me now.

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,840
Put me down.

219
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
Come on.
- Come on.

220
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,160
"Turn up the heat, sweetheart."

221
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,400
"Let the breeze in."

222
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,560
"Turn up the heat, sweetheart.
Let the breeze in."

223
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,080
"Your hero has arrived
to do the impossible."

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
"Raise the volume"

225
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
"and watch me
groove to the beat."

226
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,600
"Call on my number
that's free of cost."

227
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
"Hello."

228
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,840
"Hello."

229
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,720
"When you sway that waist,
my heart lets out a big sigh."

230
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,280
"When you shake your hips,
it causes an earthquake."

231
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,000
"One...two...three...four..."

232
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,160
"Patna Sways..."

233
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,840
"Patna Sways..."

234
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
"Baliya Sways..."

235
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,680
"Chhapra Sways..."

236
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
"Sweetheart, when you sway..."

237
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,320
"Lady, when you sway..."

238
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,360
"When you sway to the beat,"

239
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,440
"we can't stop
swaying with you."

240
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:57,040
"When you sway to the beat,
we can't stop swaying with you."

241
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,120
"My love's very rustic,
don't be surprised about it."

242
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
"Every day you groove to disco.
Today try Zumba."

243
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,160
"When you sway that waist,
my heart lets out a big sigh."

244
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,880
"When you shake your hips,
it causes an earthquake."

245
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,720
"One...two...three...four..."

246
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,920
"Kashi Sways..."

247
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
"Kashi Sways..."
Mathura Sways..."

248
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,160
"Jhansi Sways..."

249
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,560
"Sweetheart, when you sway..."

250
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,720
"When I sway to the beat,"

251
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,680
"you can't stop
swaying with me."

252
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:50,080
"When you sway to the beat,"
we can't stop swaying with you."

253
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,920
"My hero. Smashing hero."

254
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,440
"Dashing hero. Tarantino..."

255
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,400
"Flying hero. Superhero."

256
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,200
"Desi Hero."

257
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,840
"Al Pacino."

258
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,880
"When you sway to the beat,
we can't stop swaying with you."

259
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:16,520
"When you sway to the beat,
we can't stop swaying with you."

260
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,920
Congratulations, Mukesh.

261
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,920
I heard you topped your college.

262
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,840
Yes.

263
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,320
Wonderful.

264
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Soon you will find a job.

265
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes.

266
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,640
Wonderful.

267
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,600
Your life is made.

268
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,800
Have you given marriage a thought?

269
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
Not yet.

270
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,760
Come on, speak up.

271
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,440
What kind of a girl
do you have on your mind?

272
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,040
Bride?
- Yes.

273
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,400
Beautiful, calm, cultured.

274
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,560
Such girls only exist
in fairy tales. Not in reality.

275
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,600
You know you are very lucky.
I know the perfect match for you.

276
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,160
Jyoti.
- Jyoti who?

277
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Your would-be bride.

278
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
This is my wedding
and I have no clue.

279
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,520
Happens sometimes.

280
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,640
Have you heard about
a surprise party? - Yes.

281
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,400
This is your surprise wedding.

282
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
Come on.

283
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,080
You've been kidnapped, son.

284
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,800
Put me down.

285
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,880
Do you guys know what you're doing?

286
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,800
This is Bihar.

287
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,080
More than half the population
don't know what they are doing.

288
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,240
But I do.

289
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
Giving a beautiful girl your name
and your other arm some rest.

290
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,440
Stop this.

291
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
What?

292
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,800
Do you think this is a joke?
Do you know who he is?

293
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,760
They call him Abhay Singh.

294
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,720
We apologise for
the interruption,

295
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,440
but you've been kidnapped.

296
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,120
He is a smart guy.
Topper of his college.

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Right?

298
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,120
You see, sonny boy.

299
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,760
Marriages are a one-time affair.

300
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
So let it be a
memorable experience.

301
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,040
Leave me.

302
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,800
Listen, son.

303
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,640
Weddings and funerals
are my specialities.

304
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,720
Because they both cost the same.

305
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,440
"Few bouquets and a dozen men."

306
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
And the priest will perform your
final rites instead of your wedding.

307
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
And the band will
play the funeral song.

308
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,200
What would you prefer?

309
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,560
Wedding suit or coffin?

310
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,080
You get two choices
for the wedding suit.

311
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,520
And we have no options
for your shroud.

312
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,600
So hurry up.

313
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,640
'Live reporting
from the cheater boyfriend.'

314
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,040
You really cleaned his clock.

315
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,200
Why did you interfere?
I would have killed him myself.

316
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,040
And you expect the Police
to just watch like an audience.

317
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,480
Such boys...

318
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,840
Babli.

319
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,560
Take a look.
Courtesy Bihar Police.

320
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,520
You are a magician, Inspector.

321
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,000
We came down here to file
a missing person complaint,

322
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,520
but you already found her.

323
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,880
You guys are really swift.

324
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,920
Is that all?

325
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Who are you?

326
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,800
You said that you know him.

327
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,400
Babli's father.

328
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,960
He's a history teacher
at the University.

329
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,080
Yes.
And we live in Meethapur.

330
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,440
Yes.
Duniyalal.

331
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,680
Duniyalal, that's his name.

332
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
I see.

333
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,400
So you are a part of this world.

334
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,920
Who is the guy?
- Doesn't matter.

335
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
She has been charged
with attempt to murder.

336
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,920
He's ended up with 12 stitches.

337
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,960
Two out of which
even the doctor gave up.

338
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,840
Take him to a tailor instead.

339
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,400
There is a solution
to every problem, sir.

340
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,000
Is there any scope for settlement?

341
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,920
You are the real expert.

342
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,040
The world might be
founded on principles,

343
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,960
but runs only on settlements.

344
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,520
Understood?
- What settlement?

345
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,840
I will explain to you later.
- Look at me. Look at me.

346
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,400
Allow me to explain to you
over a cup of tea.

347
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,800
No, sir. Sorry, no tea for me.
I have diabetes.

348
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,760
Even I have stones in my kidney, and
I still don't stop chewing betel leaves.

349
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,720
Come on.

350
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,240
There are CCTVs everywhere.

351
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,800
They know how much
sugar we use for settlement.

352
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,400
Come with me.
- What are you doing? Come.

353
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,360
Babli Bomb.
You have become popular.

354
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,680
You look happy.

355
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,880
Happy?

356
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
You look sad.

357
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,760
What to do?
Life's completely sc***.

358
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,680
I always ended up
with spineless idiots.

359
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,080
Not a single guy
in Bihar that has guts.

360
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,000
I would rather die than say yes.

361
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,040
Let me go.
I don't want to get married.

362
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,120
Ghanti.
- Yes.

363
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,040
Did you witness the
partition of Bihar?

364
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,160
I did.

365
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,000
Now watch a Bihari
meet the same fate.

366
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,280
Watch how his head
separates from his body.

367
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,480
Let me go.

368
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,120
One last time.
Will you get married or not?

369
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,480
The train's coming closer.
Take it off.

370
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,880
How can I get the
train off the tracks?

371
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,200
Get me off the tracks.
Or I will die.

372
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,320
Do or Die?
- I won't do it.

373
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,800
Hurry up,
the train's coming closer.

374
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
I won't do it.
- Do it.

375
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
I will do it.
- Speak up. Do it.

376
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,040
I said I will do it.
- I can't hear you.

377
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,440
I said I will do it.
- Speak louder.

378
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,720
I said I will do it!

379
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,160
I am really happy.

380
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,200
Come.
You deserve a pat on your back.

381
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,920
Come on.

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
Don't try to act smart.
- He is calling me.

383
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,120
Here I am, uncle.

384
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,440
He looks like he's
been in an earthquake.

385
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,720
First, you will patch him up.

386
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,320
Then fix him up

387
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,160
I've said this before.

388
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,680
No harm should come to the face.

389
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,680
Wasn't I clear?
- Loud and clearly.

390
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,880
Then what is this?

391
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,080
You have turned
his handsome face

392
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,680
into an ugly duckling.

393
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,520
I am strongly against violence.
And strictly never on the face.

394
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,440
But Abhay threw him on...

395
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
On the ground.

396
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,840
Abhay.

397
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,480
When uncle already slapped
you once then why take my name?

398
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,720
Uncle slapped me so hard
I couldn't control myself.

399
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,680
I feared he would slap me
again and I blurted everything...

400
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
Abhay!

401
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,720
Coming.

402
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,480
Let's go.
- Coming. Coming.

403
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,640
Let's all go in pairs.

404
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,600
Father.
- Bless you, son.

405
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,080
You see, what you're doing
here is neither business nor crime.

406
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
This is a social service.
So learn to be a little polite.

407
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,760
Elections are around the bend.

408
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,200
And I want you to be
the next youth leader candidate.

409
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,480
So be more careful.

410
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,800
The people like fearless leaders,

411
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,680
not reckless.

412
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,040
Understand.

413
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,280
Who is this down to earth person?

414
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,840
Get up, uncle.

415
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
Bless you, Hukum sir.

416
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
This way, uncle.

417
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,520
How can I ever repay this favour?

418
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,960
May you live as long as me.

419
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,080
Why take the trouble
for a few extra days?

420
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,440
No need to give even a
second of your life to anyone.

421
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,800
You are the reason my
daughter is getting married.

422
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,880
Otherwise, weddings are a difficult
affair in times of inflation.

423
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,920
Yeah...

424
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Dowry is a terrible
tradition in Bihar.

425
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,120
That is why
we do this good deed.

426
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,560
Come on.
Carry on. Carry on.

427
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,080
God bless you. God bless you.

428
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,360
Please...
I guess he's too overwhelmed.

429
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,360
Call the groom.

430
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,600
Come on.

431
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,560
Let me go.

432
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,560
Hold him.

433
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,800
Let me go.

434
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,800
It's almost done.
-Sit. Sit.

435
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,440
Hello, sister-in-law.

436
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,240
Hey, photographer.
- Yes, brother.

437
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,280
It's a forced wedding.

438
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,520
I know.

439
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,280
Shouldn't look like one.

440
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,960
Move aside.

441
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,720
Smile.

442
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,480
Guddu.

443
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,280
Yes, uncle.

444
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,880
It's been a while since
I last smelled a good perfume.

445
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,920
Find me something
fresh on the market.

446
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,120
I've heard there are a couple
of fresh ones on the market.

447
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,720
Uncle, you're too much.

448
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,760
Mukesh.

449
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,720
There are only three
ways to get married in Bihar.

450
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,320
Arranged marriages,
for those with courage

451
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Love marriages, for the lucky ones.

452
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,880
And for the greedy...

453
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,360
Force marriage.

454
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,200
So Mr. Groom.

455
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,960
You and your bride are our
guests for the next couple of days.

456
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,640
Get talking,
catch a flick, chill out.

457
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,920
Get to know each other.
Fall in love.

458
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,320
Consider this your honeymoon.

459
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,520
Do you know what is a honeymoon?

460
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,040
Or did you focus on
just theory all your life?

461
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,040
He's the topper of
his college after all.

462
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,520
I don't think he ever
had time for practicals.

463
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,960
Let me explain to you, son.
Come with me.

464
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,160
Hold on.

465
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,200
Money first.

466
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,040
Brother-in-law,
where's the money for the shoe.

467
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,600
That will be 11,000 rupees.

468
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,200
Are you blind?

469
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,440
He is still wearing his shoes.

470
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,600
We cannot ignore the rituals.

471
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,880
But this ritual is
for the sister-in-law.

472
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,520
For 11,000 rupees
I can be his aunt.

473
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,240
Come on brother-in-law, now pay up.

474
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,200
Come on.

475
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,440
Here you go, keep it.

476
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,040
500 rupees again.

477
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,880
Keep it, son.
You will get a raise next year.

478
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,200
Now get lost.
- This is unfair.

479
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,560
I may be in the business
of forced weddings,

480
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,360
but I follow all the rituals.

481
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,080
And listen, you are nice guy.

482
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,080
So don't try to run.

483
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,920
You see Puttan here, never
tries to stop the gun from running.

484
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
He just shoots him.

485
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,800
Demonstrate, son.

486
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,320
Come on.
Go inside.

487
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,000
Go on.

488
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,040
Brother.

489
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,360
Can I fill in for him today?

490
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,960
He's a topper.

491
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,280
He will manage.

492
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,440
Write...

493
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,240
Write...

494
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,760
"Time was slipping through
my fingers like sand..."

495
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,720
"Time was slipping through
my fingers like sand..."

496
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,280
Write it down.

497
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,000
Don't repeat it after me.
Write it.

498
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,360
What are you checking?
- Your biceps.

499
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
What?

500
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,320
What else will I
check with a BP machine?

501
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,720
Pathak, when your young
daughter elopes from home,

502
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,400
how can the
father's BP be normal?

503
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,240
Tell him to stop
being a drama queen.

504
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,560
I saved him a fortune
in wedding expenses.

505
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,960
Do you hear how audacious...

506
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,640
She was in jail.

507
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,720
Jail.

508
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,280
I grew tired of telling
you to talk to Ravi's father.

509
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,440
But you never listen.

510
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,080
He doesn't even want dowry.

511
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,600
No dowry.

512
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,920
That Ravi and his father
are as greedy as a pig.

513
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,480
Exactly.
- Their demands were so high

514
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,960
that I had no way to fulfil them.

515
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,920
Exactly.

516
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,280
What do you mean?

517
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,240
Tell her.

518
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,040
2 million rupees and a Sedan.
That was their demand.

519
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,760
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

520
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,040
And what good would that have done?

521
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,400
I would've turned
him into that sedan.

522
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,040
She is different.

523
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,920
Hard to realise whether
she has taken after

524
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,720
her mother or me.
- Give me your hand.

525
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,560
His BP and Sugar are high.

526
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,800
I knew it.

527
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,000
I am going to meet Shreya.

528
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,560
Babli. You've become
popular all over Bihar.

529
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,480
Correct.

530
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,360
Your pictures are
all over the newspapers.

531
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,080
Can I get your autograph?

532
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,000
I mean selfie.

533
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,920
Yes, of course.
- Kanhaiyya, where is Santosh?

534
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,560
He will be here soon.

535
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,040
But you were amazing, Babli.
Isn't that right, Pintu?

536
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,600
Yes.
- You know what..

537
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,520
What?
- What?

538
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,880
She taught that Ravi a lesson
which he never forgets.

539
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,400
I am getting married
and you guys are partying.

540
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,160
What? Marriage?
- All alone?

541
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,640
Do you expect to
be a public affair?

542
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
But listen.
The cards are getting printed.

543
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,640
And you will all get
your invitations tomorrow.

544
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,000
But why so soon?

545
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,120
Don't be silly.

546
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,160
Who is the idiot?

547
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Who is he?
- Be quiet.

548
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,000
Here you go, Babli, have a bite.

549
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,520
Where did you find
your prince charming?

550
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,040
Do tell.

551
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,400
You guys will never know.

552
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,400
Tastes pathetic.

553
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Babli.

554
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,880
What's wrong with her?
- Babli, listen.

555
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
She was supposed to be
celebrating her wedding today.

556
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
But here she is with us instead.

557
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,640
Imagine.
Too bad, I tell you.

558
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,080
But you don't look sad at all.

559
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,760
Congratulations
on your new bank job.

560
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
This one's on me.

561
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,280
I got the job six months ago,
Shukla.

562
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,560
What is this?
What do you call this?

563
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,560
So small.

564
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,520
Give me a packet of chewing
tobacco and a pack of cigarettes.

565
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,400
Here you go.

566
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,000
Raman.

567
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Guddu. Looking handsome.

568
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,080
So...
- Here you go.

569
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,720
I am getting married
and you're celebrating.

570
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,200
Don't be absurd.

571
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,400
Shukla, make a juicy one for him.

572
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,800
Unbelievable.
You hit that straight for a six.

573
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,960
Yes.
- Will you come or not?

574
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,280
Of course, I will.
It's your first marriage.

575
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll be there and won't
stop dancing until I drop.

576
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,200
Hey.

577
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,120
Why didn't you tell me
that this is a forced wedding?

578
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,880
Well, Babli.

579
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,520
Every other guy had huge demands.

580
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,120
And you know our
condition pretty well.

581
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,160
Keep it, Bharat.
You're looking handsome.

582
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,200
You should get married instead.

583
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,240
Stop joking.

584
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,960
I always look handsome.

585
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,640
But this is not my wedding.

586
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,280
This is his wedding.

587
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,760
Son.

588
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,200
Have you heard of a surprise party?

589
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,640
Yes.

590
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,120
Well, sonny,
this is a surprise wedding.

591
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,480
Want to know a truth...

592
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
I am scared.

593
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
Wait. I'll get some
lemon water for you.

594
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,640
Go on.

595
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,560
Let me go.

596
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,000
It's you.

597
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,280
I am your father-in-law.
And he's your brother-in-law.

598
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,640
Prashant. Son. Take your
brother-in-law's blessings.

599
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,960
Back!

600
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,720
First of all,
you couldn't meet my dowry demands.

601
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,080
And now you got me abducted.

602
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,080
You want to force
me to this wedding.

603
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,480
But let me warn you.

604
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,960
I am a Gwala of Madhepura village.

605
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,040
And we let our fist do the talking.

606
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,040
Hold him.

607
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,000
I want to have lemon juice.
- Have you seen his list?

608
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,520
Bring lemon juice for her.
- Look here.

609
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,960
One million in cash.

610
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,320
Sedan car.

611
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,160
TV set, Washing Machine, AC-Cooler.

612
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Hand cart?

613
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,480
What?

614
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,160
Look again.

615
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,520
It must be hand watch.

616
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,280
Why didn't you include
sugar and spice as well?

617
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,680
He's a father, not a supermarket.

618
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,440
Greedy people.

619
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,000
Now you decide, wedding or jail.

620
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,560
Brother, one minute.

621
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,560
I am stupid, idiot.
I made a huge mistake.

622
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,800
I don't want any dowry.
I want to get married now.

623
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,120
No more delays.

624
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,000
Well son,
what's your favourite song.

625
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,720
Your favourite song.

626
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,680
Favourite one.

627
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,840
"The world's made of brass."

628
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,600
"And baby, I am made of gold."

629
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,880
This is a wedding, not a dance bar.

630
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,200
It's the only thing
on your mind, right?

631
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,120
Rascal!

632
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,280
Come on.

633
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,200
Hey DJ, stop the music.

634
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,840
Kamlesh, play my favourite song.

635
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,360
"This country of bravehearts."

636
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,800
You scoundrel!

637
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,560
Dance. Smile, son.

638
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,200
"This crazy world
doesn't understand love."

639
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,040
"This heart only recognises
someone like itself."

640
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,360
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

641
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,040
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

642
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,800
Abhay?

643
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,640
You are crying.

644
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,320
It's not that easy to make me cry.

645
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,560
You still don't understand
love and emotions.

646
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,640
Not changed a bit.

647
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
Earlier you carried a katty,
and not its a revolver.

648
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,800
Unbelievable...

649
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,160
you still remember.

650
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,480
I thought maybe you brushed
it off thinking as childhood love.

651
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,960
I would have done just that if
you hadn't come asking for my hand.

652
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,280
And anyway,
childhood is not easily forgotten.

653
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,280
Everything is pure in childhood.

654
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,720
Are you studying philosophy?

655
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,080
Right now I am only
trying to study you.

656
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,720
Didn't you ever miss me?

657
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,280
Where do you live in Patna?

658
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,000
Why?

659
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,920
Thinking of sneaking
into my house again.

660
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,160
Back then I was just a kid.

661
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,560
I don't ask anymore.

662
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,200
Just take what I like.

663
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,160
You should try to ask for a change.

664
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,840
Maybe you will never have to
take anything forcefully again.

665
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
Was that your childhood
flame Abhay Singh?

666
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,240
He still loves you.

667
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,840
But does he know that?

668
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,320
What?

669
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,800
I am warning you.

670
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,640
He doesn't look
like the romantic type.

671
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,920
You don't know.

672
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,080
Oh, God, What the...
- What happened?

673
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,200
She is really taking
that guy to the cleaners.

674
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,400
Brother, I thought I will
make her my sister-in-law,

675
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,680
get you two married.
But she looks dangerous.

676
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,320
Do you know what's vasectomy?

677
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,720
Vasectomy!

678
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,240
You don't know what is vasectomy.

679
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
All juice no seeds.

680
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,280
Instant service.
Snap.

681
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,760
So as I was saying...

682
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,280
Once you get a bull vasectomized
he turns into an ox.

683
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,480
Works hard on the fields all day...
...and stays tied to a pole all night.

684
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,560
Marriages are like
vasectomy for men.

685
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,560
And I don't want one.

686
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,320
And anyway, this year
I am looking to be the MLA.

687
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,200
Correct.
- Absolutely.

688
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,520
My focus is on my goal,
and not love.

689
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,120
You're right, brother.
- Correct.

690
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,280
Enough about me.

691
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
Any solution to
Raman's stubbornness...

692
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,160
I've already laced his milk with...

693
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,560
He's a clever guy and crafty too

694
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,760
He can refuse after the wedding.

695
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,920
Curse that bloody curse,
there is no way I will let him.

696
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,480
I will twist his neck.

697
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,520
There is no need for that.
Here you go.

698
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,720
We are trying to charge him up

699
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,960
and you're talking
about safety precautions.

700
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,280
Why use a sword when
you can use a needle?

701
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,840
What the...
- That's great.

702
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,680
Puncture his dreams.

703
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,120
He's a crafty bugger.

704
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,600
He must be planning on having some
fun as long as he has protection.

705
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,720
But my name is Abhay Singh.

706
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,960
His fun will be short-lived.

707
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,000
What an idea, brother.

708
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,120
Sorry for the Interruption.

709
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,200
Where did you get my number?

710
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,400
Is Litti-chokha
still your favourite?

711
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,040
I won't say no to you.

712
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,080
These people make the best in town.

713
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,440
Let's go.
- Come on.

714
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,000
You force people to get married

715
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,840
but haven't found
a bride for yourself.

716
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,040
You don't have to be
a confectioner to have sweet.

717
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,360
Such high thinking.

718
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,840
Well, you can tell
me if you like someone.

719
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll abduct him too.

720
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,560
I have someone on my mind.

721
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,040
But he's a big guy.
I don't think he's your cup of tea.

722
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,680
Why?

723
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,640
Do you like Bappi Lahiri?

724
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,200
"Dance-Dance..."

725
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,920
I would marry him.

726
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,880
But I don't want the groom to be
better dressed than me at the wedding.

727
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,920
Seriously...tell me.

728
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,520
We offer a wide array of
services and fast delivery.

729
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,800
Such hasty weddings never last.

730
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,120
Understand.

731
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,080
How dare you touch Abhay Singh?

732
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,600
Abhay Singh.

733
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,360
Then do you want me
to fall for you?

734
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,240
Give it a shot.

735
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,240
Madam. I saw you on TV.

736
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,880
Aren't you Babli Bomb?

737
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,760
Madam, can I have
a selfie with you?

738
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,880
Of course.

739
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,680
Move aside, man.

740
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,560
Come here,
son, let's take a selfie with you.

741
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,720
Let's take a selfie.
Open wide.

742
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,560
I said open wide.
Show your teeth.

743
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,520
No, no, please.
- Come on. Please.

744
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,760
Why did you scare him away?

745
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,920
It's really hot.

746
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,480
Hey!

747
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,280
Have you lost your mind?

748
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,720
Listen carefully.

749
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,960
Strict orders from
Bhartiya Bhavishya Party.

750
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,640
No one will celebrate
Valentine's Day this year.

751
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,000
You are ruining the
culture of our country.

752
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,360
Guddu, round them up.

753
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,040
Look at her.

754
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,800
I want to make her my wife.

755
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,640
So do I.

756
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,400
Stop being such a smarta***

757
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,760
If you want to watch the film
in Bihari, then go some place else.

758
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,800
And you want to continue
watching English film?

759
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,640
Wise guy.

760
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,400
And you two.

761
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,400
I sent you two here
to disperse the couples.

762
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,200
This is all your fault.

763
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,560
Shut it down.
Let's go.

764
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,720
I said shut it down.

765
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
No ones celebrating Valentines.

766
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,720
Shut it down.
- Shut it...

767
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,760
Come on. Shut it down.
Shut it...

768
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,800
Hey Romeo,
take your Juliet and get lost.

769
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,680
Hurry up.

770
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,960
What are you doing here?

771
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,680
Why are you stopping the film?

772
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,280
Party's orders...
No Valentine's Day...

773
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,880
I was here on an
official party business.

774
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,120
Are you watching the problem?

775
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,120
Is there a problem?

776
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,440
No.
No, problem.

777
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,040
I just brought the party
Workers over to watch the film.

778
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,000
What?

779
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,000
Huh...
- Correct, brother.

780
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,000
Is it any good?

781
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,640
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

782
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,440
Ask him. Don't ask me.

783
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,840
Do you always let the fizz dry out?

784
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,240
Nirauha's films are
much better than this.

785
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,840
'Vardi Wala Gunda... 2.'

786
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,560
Try to understand the emotion.

787
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,000
Why waste time on emotions?

788
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,560
Now watch...

789
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,000
The heroines going
to fresh kiss the hero.

790
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,200
French kiss.

791
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,160
You mean on his beard?

792
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,280
"No one knows"

793
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,600
"what this bond is."

794
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,720
"Once in love"

795
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,200
"there is no
way to out of it."

796
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,120
"Such is the bond of love."

797
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,440
"No one knows except
for my heart"

798
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,400
"sooner or later we
will be together forever."

799
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,160
"No one knows except
for my heart"

800
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,200
"sooner or later we
will be together forever."

801
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,760
"People are crazy
for they taunt me."

802
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,960
I've known her since childhood

803
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,640
but couldn't understand her yet.

804
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,160
The day you do,
you'll be will know what to do.

805
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,440
"This heart only recognizes
someone like itself."

806
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,760
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

807
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,720
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

808
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,400
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

809
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,080
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

810
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,040
"How do I make you explain..."

811
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,440
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

812
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,680
"Whenever you're upset with me"

813
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,240
"I will be heartbroken."

814
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,480
"I will be heartbroken."

815
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,000
"I'll renounce this world"

816
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,280
"whenever you're upset with me."

817
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,840
"I will be heartbroken."

818
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,200
"I will be heartbroken."

819
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,400
"Whenever you're upset with me..."

820
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,600
"The world's crazy..."

821
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,080
"Crazy is its people..."

822
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,840
You don't know,
Love is devotion...

823
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,240
"The world's crazy..."

824
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,800
"Crazy is its people..."

825
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,800
You don't know,
Love is devotion...

826
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,680
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

827
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,160
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

828
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,320
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes."

829
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,400
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

830
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,080
Do you want to know the truth?

831
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,120
I still love you a lot.

832
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,640
Babli, your father's staring at us.

833
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,880
I am not scared of him.

834
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,360
Let me introduce you two.
- Let it be...

835
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,440
Let me introduce you two.

836
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,400
Come on.

837
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,520
Duniyalal, meet Abhay Singh.

838
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,080
The most influential guy
around and your future son-in-law.

839
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,840
But...

840
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,720
Don't be scared.

841
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,040
Remember the guy mom slapped
me for when I was a kid.

842
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,160
That was him.

843
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,120
He loves me, and I love him.

844
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,880
No, uncle,
I just came over to drop her home.

845
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,320
It's really late, and I thought...

846
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,080
Why are you laughing?

847
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,760
He walks in his sleep.
He's asleep.

848
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,240
Asleep?

849
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,800
No.

850
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,600
His eyes are wide
awake even in his sleep.

851
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,040
Take him to a doctor.

852
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,880
Or else he might sleepwalk
his way to China.

853
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,840
Sleeping.

854
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,280
See you.

855
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,080
Sleeping.

856
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,560
You look cute even
when you are scared, Mr. Singh.

857
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,480
So what is your opinion
about your son-in-law?

858
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,760
Shameless.

859
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,560
You and that boy as well.

860
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,120
You...

861
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,600
I...

862
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,280
Duniya Lal...

863
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,680
You make me want to slap you.

864
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,320
I am a decent man.
Led a decent life.

865
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,480
Even educated you
in the same manner.

866
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,560
But now you're putting
my decency to test

867
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,040
by roaming around with
a goon in the middle of the night.

868
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,400
Shameless!

869
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,160
You will marry whoever
I tell you to.

870
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,520
How is your son-in-law?

871
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,520
What is the score?

872
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,600
You're still on Luv,
and he's on 2.

873
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,400
You've got yourself in
a terrible mess.

874
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,480
Your focus is shifting...

875
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,680
From your goal to love.

876
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,680
You don't know which way to go.

877
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,920
Oh no.

878
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,280
Here you go.

879
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,640
My focus isn't shifting.

880
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,360
Stop bothering me.

881
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,280
I am Abhay Singh.

882
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,040
I can change interest,
but not my focus. Don't forget.

883
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,440
The female always takes
the first step, not the guy.

884
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,600
Okay.

885
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,160
You will be dying to get her out
of our hair when she sticks like glue.

886
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,400
What then?

887
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,040
I will get a haircut.

888
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,800
2 million for our son.

889
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,040
Our son is studying
at the Medical College.

890
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,360
Well,

891
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,920
we can pay 2.5 million.

892
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,600
Look at your age.

893
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,280
Something will happen
to you after the wedding.

894
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,160
And son-in-law will be around.

895
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,960
He won't charge his father-in-law.

896
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,480
Think of it this way,

897
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,920
its a lifelong health
insurance for 5 million.

898
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,720
Are we looking for a
groom or health insurance?

899
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,160
Don't be absurd.

900
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,280
Look. He's a split
image of Lord Krishna.

901
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,000
With a hint of
Lord Ganesha as well.

902
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,960
Listen...such people are
not worth our time, or effort.

903
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,560
Useless.
Get up, Pappu. Come on.

904
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,160
Get up.
- We will discuss this.

905
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,320
We'll conclude.
- Listen...

906
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,880
Such penniless people don't
deserve such a decent guy...

907
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,760
Mr Pathak, you look like a
matured person.

908
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,480
Please make him understand.
- Sure.

909
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,720
What are you doing?

910
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,880
You have already eaten
six pieces of biscuits.

911
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,240
How many more do you want to have?
Put it down.

912
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,280
If I don't have it,
I'll have acidity.

913
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,440
Acidity!

914
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,720
Here is Gas-O-Fast.

915
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,520
My son is a doctor. You'll get
all the medicines here.

916
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,160
You are great. You give medicine
along with the pain.

917
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,960
Come on. Have it.
- Okay.

918
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,040
Mr Pathak, please make him
understand about social etiquette.

919
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,000
Look, you travelled a long distance
in the morning by foot.

920
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,320
So, this is the final amount.

921
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,800
"The healthy soap
for healthy people..."

922
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,200
Listen.

923
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,320
Where did you find
alcohol in a dry state?

924
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,840
Mister. People can have
children even after vasectomy.

925
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,480
This is just alcohol.

926
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,600
Don't give up just yet.
Take small sips.

927
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,320
Count me out.

928
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,880
Listen to me. There are
other ways to solve a problem.

929
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,280
Like this one.

930
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,400
Similarly,
there are many ways to get married.

931
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,280
I've heard about people
who intervene in such cases.

932
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,640
And do what?

933
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,920
Marriage, of course.

934
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,360
No, never.
Babli is my only daughter.

935
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,960
I raised her with
such love and care.

936
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,840
If things go sideways after the wedding,
then who will take responsibility?

937
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,120
I've heard that these people
are fearless and complete professionals.

938
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,880
They guarantee happiness until
the couple don't become parents.

939
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,680
Gulp it down.

940
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,400
You are a professional too.

941
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,880
I've become a teetotaler now.

942
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,160
But when alcohol wasn't banned,

943
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,680
I used to have
a couple in a week.

944
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,080
I have a question.

945
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,080
You are my friend, then how
do you know this illegal stuff.

946
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,600
Forced wedding.
What is the meaning of this.

947
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,440
This is wrong.

948
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,280
Even dowry is wrong.
That is illegal as well.

949
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,120
And what did that man do?

950
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,920
He wanted 5 million for his son
that looks like a sack of potato.

951
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,280
Where will you get
that kind of money?

952
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,840
Listen. Try to
understand the situation.

953
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,000
After Babli's escapades were
telecast on TV,

954
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,800
everyone knows
she is not cultured.

955
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,880
She is a rebel.

956
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,880
Everyone likes a rebel...

957
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,800
But, not in their own home.

958
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,200
I don't think she will
ever find a decent guy.

959
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,400
The rest is up to you.

960
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,920
How dare they demand
5 million from a teacher.

961
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,520
Yes.
- Exactly.

962
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,800
And no mention of GST yet.

963
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,920
I think their demands are
high because the lad is a doctor.

964
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,120
See.

965
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,520
He looks more like a confectioner.

966
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,920
Consider it done.

967
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,360
Don't worry.

968
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,520
Once we say yes,

969
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,280
we guarantee everything,
from wedding to settlement.

970
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,440
Really?

971
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:45,000
But before we say yes,
I would like to meet your daughter.

972
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,400
Why?

973
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,000
You see, she was raised in a city.

974
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,960
How could she say
yes to a forced wedding?

975
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,400
Why am I covering
my head with this?

976
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,920
Are you ready yet?

977
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,240
I don't want to get married.

978
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,040
Don't start that again.

979
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,680
Babli, I swear if
you make a scene,

980
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,600
then you will never
see Duniyalal again.

981
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,040
It wasn't easy for
me to convince this man.

982
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,360
Get her ready.
And hurry up.

983
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,920
Nonsense.

984
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,280
Come on, dear.
Babli.

985
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,400
Babu, this is Babli's house.

986
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,720
Why didn't you tell me?

987
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,440
What do you mean you're coming?

988
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,760
Hello...

989
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,680
Mister, whatever your name is.

990
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,200
Unbelievable, Duniyalal.

991
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,520
You knew my choice.

992
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,120
Aunty!

993
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,160
Please, listen to me.

994
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,000
Sorry, can't hear you.
I am deaf.

995
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,120
Goodbye then.

996
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,280
Goodbye accepted, son.

997
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,120
Leave.

998
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,840
Go.

999
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,080
Cheeky people.

1000
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,560
What an amazing car.
Mercedes.

1001
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,840
I feel it is the best car.

1002
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,360
Mercedes has three stars.

1003
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,000
This one's an Audi.

1004
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,720
With four circles.

1005
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
One extra.

1006
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,440
Take a look for yourself...Audi.

1007
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,360
Looks fantastic.

1008
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,760
Abhay hasn't arrived yet.

1009
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,560
He must be on his way.

1010
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,400
Well, Abhay will be here soon,
and since I am already here,

1011
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,440
where is your daughter?

1012
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,080
Not that way.
Listen.

1013
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,600
Bring her out.

1014
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,200
There she is.

1015
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,360
This way.

1016
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,160
Wish him good morning.

1017
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,480
God bless.

1018
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,880
Very cultured.

1019
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,040
Yes.

1020
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,600
But why cover her face?

1021
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,960
This is just a glimpse.
You know during Navratri,

1022
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,040
she wears two saris together.

1023
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,240
Two saris?

1024
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,160
Yes.

1025
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,760
One from the waist down,
and another one from the waist up.

1026
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,160
You are overdoing it now.

1027
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,520
Be quiet. Owing to her reputation,
I covered it up with a lot less.

1028
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,040
I hope you don't have a problem
with this wedding, dear?

1029
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,280
None whatsoever.

1030
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,080
I am talking to her.

1031
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,960
Not at all.

1032
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,120
I am very happy about
Duniyalal's decision.

1033
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,440
Babu!

1034
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,280
I want to know everything
about this boy.

1035
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,440
Cigarette, tobacco, alcohol,
if he has any such bad habits,

1036
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,320
then we'll have
to make him quit first.

1037
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,720
And yes, check whether the guy
is vegetarian or non-vegetarian.

1038
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,240
Because the girl
is pure vegetarian.

1039
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,560
She is also short tempered.

1040
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,160
So we need the guy
to be a little patient.

1041
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,480
Why do I feel you're
behaving like her father.

1042
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,040
If you love her so much
then why don't you marry her?

1043
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,600
Stop irritating me

1044
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,600
and prepare a file on Pappu.

1045
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,560
Before Babli gets
too serious about me,

1046
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,120
I will get her
married to someone else.

1047
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,040
Why are you getting him
married if it's not right?

1048
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,760
There are many things
I felt was wrong since I was a kid.

1049
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,440
You've been too.

1050
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,000
It's so spicy.

1051
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,880
You want the tears to roll down?

1052
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,960
We haven't told Babli
that this is a forced wedding.

1053
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,680
Are we making a mistake?

1054
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,320
You are doubting your idea.

1055
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,720
Telling her will lead
to a bigger problem.

1056
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,920
Have some confidence.

1057
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,120
Hey! Where do you think
you're going with that?

1058
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,400
Keep it down.

1059
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,080
Brother, Ghanti on the line.

1060
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,120
Put it on speaker.

1061
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,360
Brother, this lad is very naive.

1062
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,800
No bad habits
like tobacco or alcohol.

1063
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,840
From college to home
and back to college.

1064
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,680
That's all he does.

1065
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:30,000
He even buys his vegetables,
cooks it, and eats it too.

1066
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,360
So he is a decent guy.

1067
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,400
You know I feel he
might call his wife sister.

1068
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,760
Shut up.

1069
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,520
Don't be a wise guy.

1070
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,720
Honestly, I know such idiots.

1071
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,720
Really?

1072
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,120
Seems like a serious matter,
Daddan.

1073
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,560
Otherwise, you wouldn't
come down here so hastily.

1074
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,280
It is a serious matter,
and a personal one too.

1075
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,960
It's about my sister's wedding.

1076
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,560
And only you can
solve this problem.

1077
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,640
How can I solve your
sister's marriage problem?

1078
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,120
Show him.

1079
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,440
Let me see...

1080
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,560
What the bloody...

1081
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,400
I've already taken up this case.
- That's the problem.

1082
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,000
You have taken an advance,
but I'll give you double.

1083
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,800
Money in milk canisters.

1084
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,720
I have a question, Daddan.

1085
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:04,440
This money is enough to give
your daughter a grand wedding.

1086
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,920
Why do this favour to me?

1087
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,080
I am not doing favour.

1088
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,240
The family doesn't want just dowry.

1089
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,440
They want a decent family.

1090
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,320
And they will never say yes to me.

1091
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,720
I don't want your money.
Keep it.

1092
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,200
But I will be the next candidate
from Gaya in the next election.

1093
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,040
Done.

1094
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,120
The seat is yours, with my support.

1095
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,160
But I won't take this money back.

1096
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,240
Fine. Not a problem.

1097
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,600
Now Guddu,
the problem is how do we say no.

1098
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,560
"My beloved, don't go
to the river bank."

1099
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,520
"My beloved, don't go
to the river bank."

1100
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,080
"Come to me when you are sure,
my beloved."

1101
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,040
"I will adorn the
ring on your finger"

1102
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,840
"and make you my queen."

1103
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,440
"Show you the world, beloved."

1104
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,080
"I will tell you all
my passwords and pins."

1105
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,040
"And put your face on DP."

1106
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,680
"I'll rub your feet all night,"

1107
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,960
"get yourself a pedicure."

1108
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,280
"It will be fun."

1109
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,840
"When we start having
rosy-cosy conversations,"

1110
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,520
"you can pull the string."

1111
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,200
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1112
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,440
"because its very hot."

1113
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,760
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1114
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,160
"because its very hot."

1115
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,760
"It's so hot and
you don't stop being shameless."

1116
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,760
"Let me turn up the
AC because it's really hot."

1117
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,680
"My beloved, don't go
to the river bank."

1118
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,520
"My beloved, don't go
to the river bank."

1119
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,520
"The boys out there
are very stubborn."

1120
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,400
"The boys out there are very rude."

1121
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,080
"They tease me all the time,
beloved."

1122
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,720
"My beloved, don't go
to the river bank."

1123
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,760
"I'll rub your feet all night"

1124
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,360
"get yourself a pedicure."
"It will be fun."

1125
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,920
"When we start having
rosy-cosy conversations"

1126
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,400
"you can pull the string."

1127
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,160
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1128
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,480
"because it's very hot."

1129
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,480
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1130
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,160
"because it's very hot."

1131
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,600
"It's so hot and you don't stop
being shameless."

1132
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,240
"Let me turn up the
AC because it's really hot."

1133
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,360
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1134
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,320
"because it's very hot."

1135
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,240
Abhay, I have a job for you.
- Yes.

1136
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,200
Take these 2 million rupees
and return it to Duniyalal Yadav.

1137
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,960
He hid the fact that
his daughter's been to jail.

1138
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,320
Father...

1139
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,160
Isn't it wrong to
return the advance?

1140
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,360
"Seal the deal with your lips"

1141
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,240
"and give your confirmation."

1142
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,720
"Don't try to ignore..."

1143
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,600
"We'll be serious
when we come to it."

1144
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,400
"We'll think about
it when the time comes..."

1145
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,040
"Don't try to be too sentimental."

1146
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,600
"You will have to handle
my moods and my attitude..."

1147
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,000
"Don't get irritated."

1148
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,280
"It will be fun."

1149
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,800
"I will handle your
moods all my life."

1150
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,600
"Just pull the string..."

1151
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,000
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1152
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,480
"because its very hot."

1153
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,800
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1154
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,120
"because its very hot."

1155
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,640
"It's so hot and you don't stop
being shameless."

1156
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,240
"Let me turn up the
AC because it's really hot."

1157
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,160
"Don't pull up the mosquito net,
beloved"

1158
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,680
"because its very hot."

1159
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,520
Sister, Abhay has arrived.
Let's go.

1160
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,600
Keep it inside, son.
It's from Motihari uncle.

1161
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,440
And food... Tell the ladies that
the food is ready.

1162
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,040
Otherwise, it will get cold.

1163
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,240
Come on...

1164
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,760
What are you doing here?

1165
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,080
I've had enough of this.

1166
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,920
No love or anything...
She is getting married.

1167
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,760
First of all,
I don't love Babli.

1168
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,280
And secondly, Hukum Dev sent me.

1169
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,800
To return the money.
- What money?

1170
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,240
Father has said that
we cannot get her married.

1171
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,520
She has been to jail.

1172
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,640
What father? Whose father?
What has he said?

1173
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,280
I am Hukum Dev's son.

1174
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,680
Pathak.
- Yes. Yes, Duniyalal.

1175
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,720
Look, he's Hukum Dev's son.

1176
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,400
Hello.
- What hello?

1177
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,720
Say something.
- Of course.

1178
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,240
Tea or cold drink.
- Hey...

1179
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,960
Look, son, are you behind all this?

1180
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,560
Have you lost your mind?

1181
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,440
I already said that
I don't love her.

1182
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,400
She has been to jail so
no one's willing to marry her.

1183
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,880
Here you go.
- Hey mister, what did you say?

1184
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,720
Who are you to decide
anyone's character?

1185
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,840
We haven't slept for
three nights in a row.

1186
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,440
I took care of all these
decorations single-handedly,

1187
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,480
so I won't take
any nonsense from you.

1188
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,160
Look at me when you're talking.

1189
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,040
The name is Abhay Singh.

1190
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,520
There isn't going to be any wedding here,
but I will turn this into a funeral.

1191
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,080
Goodbye then.

1192
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,800
You can never trust a Yadav,
you know.

1193
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,400
It's difficult to get their votes.

1194
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,040
Greetings.

1195
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,280
Did you return it?

1196
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,760
Yes.
- Bravo.

1197
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:24,680
Follow my instructions
like the word of God.

1198
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:29,000
And then...you won't just
win the war, but conquer too.

1199
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,000
Guddu,

1200
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,200
Did you arrange for
the picture with a smile.

1201
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,640
I've added the smile.

1202
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,120
Looks bomb.

1203
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,920
Sometimes I feel
really proud of you.

1204
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,920
I always thought
I am doing a good deed

1205
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,280
but suddenly I realised
what crime I was committing.

1206
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,600
This is not right, Babu.

1207
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,080
You haven't eaten
anything since morning.

1208
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,400
You will fall sick...

1209
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,320
What?

1210
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,680
All your life you taught me
to stay away from strangers.

1211
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,800
And now you were getting
me married to one.

1212
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,560
To the dinner table, everyone.

1213
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,560
Don't waste a single morsel.

1214
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,040
We can't stop living
if the wedding was cancelled.

1215
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,280
At least eat now.

1216
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,520
Don't force him.

1217
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,280
Because it's never good.

1218
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,680
What do we do about
that Abhay Singh?

1219
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,800
What have you done?

1220
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,680
What do we do about
that bloody idiot?

1221
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,840
I will kill...you.

1222
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,920
If you waste any more beer.

1223
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,600
We only have a few bottles left.

1224
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,480
Babli's wedding got cancelled
and you're worried about beer.

1225
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,840
Unbelievable

1226
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,400
Why doesn't anyone
abduct that Abhay Singh?

1227
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,320
Stop talking, will you?

1228
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,720
Who...

1229
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,800
Only someone with a death
wish will abduct Abhay Singh.

1230
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,120
I will...

1231
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,920
What?

1232
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,840
I will abduct Abhay Singh.

1233
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,840
You don't have to.

1234
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,760
He can set an alarm
and wake up on his own.

1235
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,240
Let's go, you are drunk.

1236
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,400
I will abduct Abhay Singh.

1237
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,680
Santo...

1238
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,320
We will wake up Abhay Singh...
Are you with me?

1239
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,280
Yes, we will wake him up.

1240
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:40,360
We will abduct him
and force him to marry me.

1241
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,000
We will abduct him
and force him to marry me.

1242
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,960
Not you...just me.

1243
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,560
Babli Bomb's forced wedding.

1244
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,240
"It's my best friend's wedding."

1245
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,200
I won't spare you, Abhay Singh.

1246
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,520
I won't spare him so easily.

1247
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,640
"Babli Bomb."

1248
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,760
So who is with me?

1249
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,400
Were you serious last night, Babli?

1250
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,520
I thought it was
just a drunken rant.

1251
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,040
Whether drunk or otherwise,
I never go back on my words.

1252
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,080
So who is with me?

1253
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,840
Now that's what I call friends.

1254
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,120
They are surrendering.

1255
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,800
No ones with you.

1256
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,880
Babli can pull it
off all by herself.

1257
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,760
By yourself?

1258
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,960
What do you think, Babli?

1259
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,280
I didn't build this
body only to attract girls?

1260
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,640
Correct, Pintu.
- Exactly.

1261
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,960
We are with you.
Do worry.

1262
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,200
And I am with you too.
Me too.

1263
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,600
Count me in too.

1264
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,880
Me too.

1265
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,440
We are all there for you.

1266
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,000
And Santo, you?

1267
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,400
Fine, I am in too.

1268
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,320
I'll arrive on time to bail you out
of jail and collect your bodies.

1269
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,240
I know he's Abhay Singh, but
don't forget I am Kanhaiya Kuswa.

1270
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,960
Santo,

1271
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,040
are you with me or not?

1272
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,480
Look, Babli...
- Yes or no.

1273
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,000
Yes or no.

1274
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,480
That is all.

1275
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,120
What is the plan?

1276
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:47,360
There is only one place
where we can find him alone

1277
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,920
aand the only place
where he bows his head.

1278
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,200
That's where you will
abduct that Goliath.

1279
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,640
Are the handkerchief
and chloroform ready?

1280
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,480
Yes, ready.

1281
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,200
What are you doing?

1282
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,800
I remember.

1283
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,600
'Forced!'

1284
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Charge. Charge...

1285
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,800
'Forced!'

1286
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,040
I mean let's charge
on the sweetmeats.

1287
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,440
Brother, give me the offering.

1288
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,360
Me too, brother.

1289
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,640
Who are you?

1290
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,120
Banke. Pintu. Kanhaiyya.

1291
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,640
He's our brother.

1292
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,640
Older brother.
Wish him.

1293
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,120
Greetings, brother.

1294
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,320
Glory to Lord.
- Glory to him.

1295
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,640
Glory to Lord.

1296
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,840
What do we do about
that Abhay Singh?

1297
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,160
You suggest.

1298
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,880
Busy eating ice-cream.

1299
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,120
Are you going to do it?

1300
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,680
You guys just take care that
I don't end up killing him.

1301
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,880
Fine.
- I'll be right back.

1302
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,320
"Glory to the Goddess."

1303
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,240
"Glory to her benevolence!"

1304
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,720
You suggest.

1305
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,520
What happened to your
immeasurable strength?

1306
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,960
And you still couldn't
get Abhay Singh.

1307
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,560
Have another...

1308
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,080
He's coming. He's coming.

1309
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,760
Handkerchief ready.

1310
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,400
Greetings, brother.

1311
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,040
He left.
- God saved him.

1312
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,040
Otherwise...

1313
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,040
I've been observing for three days.

1314
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,760
What is going on?

1315
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,120
Kidnap.

1316
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,520
Who?

1317
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,960
You.

1318
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,600
And where will you take me?
- Let's get past stage 1 first.

1319
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,280
Fine.

1320
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,680
Brother...

1321
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,400
Listen to me.

1322
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,600
I will show you.

1323
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,680
Brother... Leave him...

1324
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,520
What's going on, Guddu?

1325
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,760
What is all the commotion about?

1326
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,560
It's been 6 hours, uncle.

1327
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,760
And still no clue about Abhay.

1328
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,240
God knows where he is.

1329
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,240
He loves to plan surprise weddings,
doesn't he?

1330
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,960
But today he is in
for a surprise himself.

1331
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,040
That's not true, Singh sir.

1332
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,880
We searched high and low
except for the women's cleavage.

1333
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,200
But don't worry,
he will be recovered pretty soon.

1334
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,200
He's not some piece of ammunition
which you will recover.

1335
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,800
Idiot.

1336
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,840
Get up.

1337
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,320
Come on, get up.

1338
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,760
Guddu, you guys leave too.

1339
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,000
Just a few more minutes.

1340
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,840
Let them bring some
tea and biscuits.

1341
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,760
Can you forget the
damn tea for a minute?

1342
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,560
I said leave. Leave.

1343
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,320
I looked everywhere from
Sultanganj to Meethapur.

1344
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,880
But still no clue about him.

1345
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,920
I even updated the
status on Facebook.

1346
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,080
Lost brother, with 28 others.

1347
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,480
Come closer.
- Yes.

1348
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,000
Did you have breakfast?

1349
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,200
I haven't had a single
morsel since morning.

1350
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,240
What about you?

1351
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,360
I had breakfast
in the morning, uncle.

1352
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,880
Brother has been missing all
day and you were having breakfast.

1353
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,520
Uncle...

1354
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,960
It's Abhay.

1355
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,400
We've been looking for you,
even the Police.

1356
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,760
It's been 6 hours.

1357
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,840
Abhay, I am asking you something.

1358
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,600
Say something.

1359
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,480
We've been looking for you,
even the Police. But...

1360
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,360
You are riding around
the city on a horse.

1361
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,440
Are you going to tell us anything?

1362
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,800
Move aside.

1363
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,400
What is all this?

1364
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,920
Where were you since morning?

1365
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,240
I had a quarrel with couple of
boys outside the temple.

1366
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,240
Then I suddenly fell unconscious

1367
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,800
and don't know what happened next.

1368
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,080
What boys?

1369
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,200
Find out who they were.

1370
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,720
Babli Bomb has sent
an explosive video.

1371
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,560
Don't forget to watch
it with your family.

1372
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,680
Pardon me,

1373
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,760
the wedding was arranged
on a short notice

1374
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,840
so we couldn't invite you.
- Isn't that Babli.

1375
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,640
But we followed every
ritual and tradition.

1376
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,680
I would've even cried
if there had been a send-off.

1377
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:36,200
But we couldn't get to that part
because the wedding is still incomplete.

1378
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,240
You're a hollow man.

1379
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,600
And I can never expect
you to complete anything.

1380
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,720
What you saw was
just a whiff of things?

1381
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,200
We have a full video too.

1382
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,120
And its called...

1383
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,880
Forced Couple.

1384
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,680
It will be released
whenever you want...

1385
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,320
It's a goodbye.

1386
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,920
Guddu, Haddi, Halla.

1387
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,560
Show that girl...
- Don't worry, uncle.

1388
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,000
We will kill her.

1389
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,400
Come on.
- Bravo.

1390
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,200
Come here.

1391
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,880
Everyone has a brain,
but not everyone is smart.

1392
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,400
Elections are around the corner.

1393
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,040
No bloodshed.
- Uncle, I get it.

1394
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,680
Let's go.

1395
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,120
Wait.

1396
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,760
I will do whatever
needs to be done.

1397
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,760
Bravo.

1398
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:43,280
Teach her a lesson that she
never forgets even if she wants to.

1399
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,200
What is going on?

1400
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,240
I won't let you through. Never.

1401
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,160
Look, son, for ugly faces,

1402
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,000
wise guys, and meddling people
I only give funeral service.

1403
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,960
That day I slapped you,
but this time I will kill you.

1404
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,000
Come here. Come here.

1405
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,320
I'll make you regret it.
Get lost.

1406
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,920
Hey...
- What are you doing?

1407
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,080
Hold on.
- What's going on?

1408
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,480
Where do you think you are going?

1409
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,720
Maybe you don't remember, uncle.

1410
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,040
I asked for her hand
when I was just a kid.

1411
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,280
But you refused.

1412
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,480
So I am taking her now.

1413
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,960
You are worried about her marriage,
aren't you?

1414
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:51,880
Yes.

1415
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,200
So I am going to
get rid of that forever.

1416
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,320
It's goodbye.

1417
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,680
Say something, Pathak.
- Bless you, son.

1418
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,800
They are not husband and wife yet.
He is abducting her.

1419
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,680
Let me go, Santo.

1420
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,920
I want to know what is
on this Abhay Singh's mind.

1421
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,120
Because he doesn't have a heart.

1422
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,480
"Shattered dreams,"

1423
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,680
"even my heart betrays me."

1424
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,480
"Pines for the one"

1425
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,600
"that never belongs to you."

1426
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,320
"The yearning eyes"

1427
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,720
"searching in every direction."

1428
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:40,200
"Tries to find a refuge in you"

1429
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,680
"always so stubborn."

1430
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:50,880
"My heart... Shuns me."

1431
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,600
"Makes me pine"

1432
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,200
"even though
its not my mistake."

1433
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,640
"Always fighting with you."

1434
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:12,040
"Always yearning for you."

1435
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,440
"You're the sky
and I am the earth."

1436
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,960
"That's the only difference
between you and me."

1437
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,320
"It's a business of cheating."

1438
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,120
"Deceit is all the heart has won."

1439
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,840
"Shattered dreams,"

1440
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,920
"confused stars."

1441
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,600
"Unlucky fate,"

1442
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,920
"and two shores
that never meet."

1443
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,480
"Wondering aimlessly..."

1444
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,040
"My path is lost."

1445
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,400
"I surrender myself"

1446
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,600
"to the one who
couldn't be mine."

1447
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,320
"Some unsaid words still remain..."

1448
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,160
"Which should have been said."

1449
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,480
"Was I wrong"

1450
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,640
"or was I right."

1451
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:16,320
"We share no connection anymore."

1452
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:23,440
"Our paths are divided."

1453
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:29,600
"Everytime I see you"

1454
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:37,040
"our story repeats itself."

1455
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,160
I didn't render you unconscious
nor will this be an incomplete wedding.

1456
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,360
I will finish what I started.

1457
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,840
And don't even think
about running away.

1458
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,200
Do you really believe that
you brought me here forcefully?

1459
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,280
I came here willingly,
and also leave when I want.

1460
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,760
Let's see how far you go.

1461
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,000
Guddu, start the decorations.

1462
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,480
Call the priest.

1463
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,360
She will get justice.

1464
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:16,800
Be prepared to get married
according to tradition and ritual.

1465
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,160
Then don't go back on your words,
Mr. Singh.

1466
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,320
See...I told you so.

1467
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,160
"The tears turn to fire"

1468
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,680
"and turns my body to ashes."

1469
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,880
"I am bleeding from inside"

1470
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,480
"drop by drop
falling in the abyss."

1471
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,880
"Fake promises,
unfulfilled desires."

1472
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,280
"And absurd intentions."

1473
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,760
"The tears turn to fire"

1474
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,320
"and turns my body to ashes."

1475
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,440
"Shattered dreams"

1476
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,040
"confused stars."

1477
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:20,520
"Unlucky fate
and two shores that never meet."

1478
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,200
"Wondering aimlessly..."

1479
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,240
"My path is lost."

1480
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,200
"I surrender myself"

1481
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,960
"to the one who
couldn't be mine."

1482
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,920
Too good, Abhay, too good.

1483
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,720
You saved Babli from
Hukum Dev Singh's wrath.

1484
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,240
She is an amazing girl.

1485
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,640
Imagine she adducted me.

1486
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,040
Even forced me to marry her.

1487
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,760
I knew it all along,
she is the perfect match for you.

1488
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,280
But I am not worthy of her.

1489
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:13,440
Abhay, where is the problem?
If you love her then just tell.

1490
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,800
Talk to her with confidence.

1491
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,280
The world is scared
of Abhay Singh

1492
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,440
but why is Abhay
Singh scared of her.

1493
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,800
I am not scared.

1494
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,320
Stop lying...

1495
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,680
This body...

1496
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,120
It's like my father.

1497
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,560
But my heart's like my mother.

1498
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,400
I've seen my mother
cry in a corner.

1499
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,880
Don't you remember,
I rebelled a few times

1500
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,080
but what good did that do?

1501
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:09,360
Father punished
her for my mistakes.

1502
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,640
Since then I did
everything he said.

1503
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,520
Mother's condition
never got better...

1504
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,600
but I became like her.

1505
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,480
You know.
Father still keeps hooking up.

1506
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,760
If I turn out to be like my father,

1507
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,040
I will never be honest
with this relation.

1508
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:10,800
Not to forget that charade
that Babli cooked up in that video.

1509
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,200
If I tell father about us,
he will shoot me first.

1510
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:20,800
Listen. These emotions suit Arijit
Singh better, not you, Abhay Singh.

1511
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,480
I have decided, Babu.

1512
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,920
I have decided.

1513
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,960
You coward.
- I have decided.

1514
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,520
Call yourself Arijit Singh instead.

1515
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,960
Ask someone else to finish
combing the rest of your hair.

1516
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,440
Looking good.

1517
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,200
Babli.

1518
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,520
Why don't you answer your phone?
Are you okay?

1519
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,800
Yes, I am fine.
Why wouldn't I be fine?

1520
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,760
Are you alright?
And Duniyalal, uncle.

1521
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,880
Is everyone alright?

1522
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,600
I can't vouch for them,
but I am good.

1523
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,560
Santo.

1524
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,280
You said that Abhay
Singh doesn't love me.

1525
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,600
But lover boy's all ready
to walk down the aisle with me.

1526
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:07,360
I know he's ready, but are you?

1527
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,040
If he's ready, then so I am..

1528
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,640
Let's wait and watch.

1529
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,720
No couplets today?

1530
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,920
Why not?

1531
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,400
They are made for
situations like this.

1532
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,520
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Presenting to you Santosh Pathak.

1533
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,640
I am heartbroken
and shattered to pieces.

1534
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,160
Life feels devastated.

1535
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,840
So what if I am heartbroken.

1536
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,560
What's satisfying
is that she is happy.

1537
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,920
Why...

1538
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,640
Why did you...

1539
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,480
Why did you hit me?

1540
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,520
Let me go.

1541
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,600
Oh, my dear.

1542
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,120
Keep quiet.

1543
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,600
Babli...your groom's here.

1544
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,360
What groom?

1545
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,320
Her?

1546
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,960
You abducted me to marry her.

1547
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,400
I am willing to
marry her at any time.

1548
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,040
And listen, you didn't have
to go through all this trouble.

1549
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,320
But I won't let your effort go to
waste. I will pay for everything.

1550
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,640
Listen...I am coming.
I am ready.

1551
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,960
Quiet.

1552
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,040
Take him inside.

1553
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,760
No. I don't feel like it.

1554
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,920
Why do you look stressed?

1555
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,880
Did some girl say yes to you?

1556
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,840
Remember that guy whom
we got married two months ago.

1557
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,520
He is talking about divorce.

1558
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,480
Says that he will divorce her.

1559
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,600
What the...

1560
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,480
Let's go.

1561
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,680
We'll first set him straight and then
get those two to renew their vows again.

1562
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,240
You don't get it.

1563
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,760
The girl says

1564
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:20,280
why did you get me forcefully
married to him when he doesn't love me.

1565
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,480
Forced weddings are
like Chinese goods.

1566
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,680
You can't guarantee
how long it will last.

1567
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:31,760
Love is important in marriage.

1568
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,240
You can't force someone
to live together forever.

1569
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,720
The entire situation is screwed up.

1570
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,960
Am I wrong?

1571
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:59,080
Abhay Singh abducted
your innocent daughter Babli.

1572
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,400
And she didn't scream,
or shout, nor tried to resist.

1573
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,200
She left with him quietly...
...after all he is a gangster.

1574
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,280
Why take a risk after all?

1575
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,320
Then there is no case here at all.

1576
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,240
They are both adults.
They have free will.

1577
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,200
First, she abducted him,
now he's abducted her.

1578
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,120
Let them continue with
their little game. Move.

1579
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,560
Pathak, please reason with him.
Say something.

1580
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,720
Sir, you are being unfair.
I think you have been corrupted.

1581
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,760
I am ready to be corrupted again.

1582
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,400
Can you pay the same price?
Can you?

1583
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,600
Brother... Brother,
please put this up somewhere.

1584
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,520
Hey drummer...

1585
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,400
Yes, you. Make some noise.

1586
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:40,920
Brother, dance with me.
Come on.

1587
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,600
Ghanti.
- Yes, brother.

1588
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:48,800
Bring some ice.

1589
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,960
Brother, I've finished
decorating the venue,

1590
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,360
all the flowers are in place.

1591
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,600
And also instructed
the priest to be thorough

1592
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,400
and promised him a bonus.

1593
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,080
Want a sip?

1594
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:14,120
No, brother. I don't drink.

1595
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,960
How else did you get this paunch?

1596
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,840
Come on.

1597
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,640
Babu.

1598
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,400
Only because you are insisting.
You're forcing my hand.

1599
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,120
Can I have another one?

1600
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,800
Please...

1601
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,160
This is because I
worked so hard all day.

1602
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,840
Making sure the flowers
and decorations are in place.

1603
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,600
This is my first wedding after all.

1604
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,800
Everything should be perfect,
correct?

1605
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,680
What are you looking at?
Make me another drink.

1606
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,320
Brother insists...

1607
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,680
This suit is really tedious.

1608
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,200
Should I take it off?
- Why not?

1609
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,080
Can I tell you a secret...

1610
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,080
You have done a big favour
to Papendra Yadav aka Pappu,

1611
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,320
Swear.

1612
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:30,040
I mean...I never imagined I'll
end up with such a bodacious gal.

1613
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:39,240
Finally, all those years
of waiting will pay off.

1614
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,040
Put some ice.

1615
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,480
Please...

1616
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,280
And, I don't know
if you've noticed,

1617
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,360
but whenever our eyes meet,

1618
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:56,480
she looks the other
way out of embarrassment.

1619
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,360
Put some water, will you?

1620
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,360
And you know...

1621
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,560
One more thing...

1622
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,600
She may look naive,

1623
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,200
but she is gorgeous, no doubt.

1624
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,920
And feisty.

1625
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:20,280
And. One more thing.

1626
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,400
You're teasing me for this paunch.

1627
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,960
For the next six months, I am going
to shower her with so much love

1628
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:31,400
that soon she will be
sporting a paunch like me.

1629
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,080
Another drink?

1630
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,760
Spare me, brother. Not another sip.

1631
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,520
One more sip and my wedding
night will be ruined.

1632
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,760
But I will

1633
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,680
Why you bloody...

1634
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,120
What?

1635
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,560
But...
- You are not even fit to be her brother.

1636
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:56,480
Beat him.

1637
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,720
Wait.

1638
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,360
Drummer...
Hit him to the beat.

1639
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,520
You can never let me marry him.

1640
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,920
I thought he's a decent guy.

1641
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,720
He will take good care of him.

1642
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,160
But he turned out to be a pervert.

1643
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,480
You don't get married yourself

1644
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,400
and don't let
me marry anyone else.

1645
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,240
Even wondered why?

1646
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,600
Yes...
I did...

1647
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,560
My father's blood
runs through my veins.

1648
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,720
I won't be able to take care of you,
just like he never took care of my mother.

1649
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,480
But you must remember
your mother's upbringing too.

1650
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,600
If you can't go
against your father,

1651
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,640
then don't forget that
even I have a father.

1652
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:48,800
I am not scared of him,
but I do love him a lot.

1653
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,920
And I never cared about him.

1654
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,040
So now you do as
your father says

1655
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,800
and I will listen to my father.

1656
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,200
Are you okay?

1657
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,680
Is everything okay?

1658
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,000
Yes...did you have dinner?

1659
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:49,800
I'll cook something.

1660
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,200
Anything left to eat?

1661
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:57,800
What's the matter?
You are asking about dinner.

1662
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,840
Is everything alright?

1663
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:10,800
I fixed that Abhay Singh for good.

1664
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,520
I don't know whether
he learned his lesson or not

1665
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,840
but you don't look fine to me.

1666
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,480
Why?

1667
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,640
Because you are chopping
chillies instead.

1668
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:34,880
What happened?

1669
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,120
What happened?

1670
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,480
You know what's wrong
and what's right.

1671
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,000
Then why don't you act accordingly?

1672
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,800
I couldn't do it, mother.

1673
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,280
I've seen you suffer
since I was a kid.

1674
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,080
And there was nothing I could do.

1675
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,400
I will do as you say.

1676
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,560
I will marry anyone you want.

1677
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,240
First of all,
stop crying like a girl.

1678
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,280
Come on.

1679
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,040
Let those tears out, son.

1680
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,240
Otherwise,
they can be very painful.

1681
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,520
I won't do anything
wrong anymore

1682
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,120
nor let anyone
be treated unfairly.

1683
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,960
Let your mind take the decision

1684
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,640
and your heart follows.

1685
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,040
That's all.

1686
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,160
I can't get that bloody
female out of my mind.

1687
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:52,840
Once the elections are over,
I will personally take care of her.

1688
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,120
Charan...
- Yes, brother.

1689
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,400
Show him.

1690
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,000
We've taken advance for this guy.

1691
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:04,560
Go and get him.

1692
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,520
Hello, candyman.

1693
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:10,920
What's up?

1694
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,560
Show some respect.
The name is Salim.

1695
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,160
Prince Salim.

1696
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,120
Forget about Anarkali.

1697
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,680
The emperor has sent for you.

1698
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,880
Don't you get it?
What?

1699
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,720
Do you know what's
a surprise party?

1700
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:26,040
Yes.

1701
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,920
This is your surprise wedding.

1702
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,760
Understand.

1703
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,080
Son...you've been kidnapped.

1704
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,560
What nonsense.

1705
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,160
I love Ruksar.

1706
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:43,360
But if you love Ruksar,
why are you taking her for a ride?

1707
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,080
She is Ruksar.
And I want to marry her.

1708
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:48,640
So she is Ruksar.

1709
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:54,600
This is not love, my son.
This is lust. understood.

1710
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:55,960
Wait.

1711
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,560
Let him go.
- Let him go?

1712
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,960
Think about what you're saying,
brother.

1713
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:09,240
Guddu.

1714
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,920
For the first time, I let my heart take
the decision and listened to my heart.

1715
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,320
Let them go.

1716
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:18,960
Salim, make her your wife...before
some other villain arrives in your life.

1717
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,200
You cannot leave like this.

1718
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,840
I mean take your bags too.

1719
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,080
Madam, take your bag.

1720
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,080
Go on, don't worry.

1721
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,920
I have a question, Abhay.

1722
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,040
Do you see Abhay and Babli in them?

1723
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,080
Ran away.

1724
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,880
How did they run away?

1725
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,520
Father, I...
- What?

1726
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,720
I was...
- I have taken an advance.

1727
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,120
Then return it.

1728
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,000
That is not a problem.

1729
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,600
We have done it before.

1730
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,000
What did you say?

1731
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,600
He's grown wings.

1732
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,760
I fully support development.

1733
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,680
You know that.

1734
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:24,800
I regret that our deal went sour.

1735
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,720
You are an MLA candidate.

1736
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,080
And you don't know what's
going on in your home.

1737
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,440
What do you mean?

1738
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,720
That guy Pappu whom
I wanted to marry my sister...

1739
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,960
...he tried to get him
married to that Babli Bomb.

1740
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,760
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1741
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:47,800
Now you will know how hazardous
I can be as an emissary.

1742
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,280
Trying to be a wise guy, huh.

1743
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,080
Friendships last
longer than enmity.

1744
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,480
I am no longer interest.

1745
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,040
I've already severed
both my hands.

1746
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,880
I've no reason to spread
an olive branch to you.

1747
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:10,360
Then what about your
sister's hand...for Abhay.

1748
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:14,120
I hope you will guard
this promise with your life?

1749
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:17,440
This time I will.

1750
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,280
Right said.

1751
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:36,880
Hello.

1752
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,840
You want to meet him.

1753
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:44,760
Even I have something
important to say to you.

1754
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,360
But I get to decide the place.

1755
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,760
Be ready.
- Yes.

1756
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,080
Play it on time.
- Yes.

1757
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,760
Hey
- Yes, brother.

1758
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,120
Have you gone crazy?
- Hey!

1759
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,320
He only wants to propose to her.
That's it.

1760
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:28,040
We ought to make it big, Guddu.

1761
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:29,280
Listen carefully.

1762
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:30,760
This is my first proposal.

1763
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,040
Don't ruin it for me.

1764
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,760
It's really simple, believe me.

1765
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:37,560
Imagine I am Abhay
Singh and he is Babli.

1766
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,720
Propose to Babli.
- Yes.

1767
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,800
The name is Abhay Singh.

1768
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,200
Weddings and Funerals
are my expertise.

1769
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:48,160
I smoke weed and drink beer
all day, and still don't budge.

1770
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,760
And always carry a revolver.

1771
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,040
Listen, I love you, here's a rose.

1772
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:53,920
Marry me.

1773
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,600
The name is Babli Yadav.

1774
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,960
Wasn't one clip enough for you?
Should I make another one?

1775
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,800
We can file a case
against her for this.

1776
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,840
Was that a proposal or an exposure?

1777
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,000
We're doing exactly as we've seen.

1778
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:06,200
Now listen...

1779
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,960
Have you given these
people clear instructions?

1780
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,000
Yes...

1781
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:10,840
Brother, wear your glasses.

1782
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,360
Come on.

1783
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,400
Come on.

1784
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,040
One...Two...

1785
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,200
Stop...

1786
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,680
What happened?
- What is this?

1787
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:27,640
As soon as you reach
on spot and wear your glasses,

1788
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,040
the band will start playing.

1789
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,120
She's here.

1790
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,800
Listen, Babli's here.
Get lost... Leave...

1791
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,080
How are you?

1792
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,960
Handsome.
What about you?

1793
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,360
You look happier.

1794
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,800
So... What was so important?

1795
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:28,280
I will say what I want to say...

1796
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:32,080
But you say first.
Why did you want to meet?

1797
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,440
It was for the wedding.

1798
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:45,680
You see,
we've been through a lot lately.

1799
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,280
So, I've put my past behind

1800
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,760
and came to give you
this wedding card.

1801
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,720
Wedding card?

1802
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:09,080
Yes... I always did what I wanted.

1803
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:13,880
But now I want to do something
to make my father happy.

1804
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,000
I am marrying Santosh.

1805
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,160
He loves me.

1806
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,480
That's all.

1807
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,760
What was so important?

1808
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,520
It's not that important anymore.

1809
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,640
When is the wedding?

1810
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,440
25th May.

1811
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,160
See you.

1812
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,760
Do come.

1813
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,800
Of course.

1814
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,040
Let me know if you need anything.

1815
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:16,360
Abhay Singh...

1816
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:20,840
Weddings and...

1817
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:27,360
I don't understand, brother...

1818
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,640
Did Babli leave too early
or was brother too late?

1819
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,960
I am also confused.

1820
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,080
I've been repeating the
same thing over and over again.

1821
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:56,200
Don't try to be a wise
guy with your father.

1822
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,640
I don't get it, father.

1823
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:08,560
Are you in love with that girl
that you don't understand anymore?

1824
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,680
That's not it.

1825
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,600
And shouldn't be.

1826
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:17,680
Cause only as much
trouble as you can handle.

1827
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:23,600
I've fixed your marriage
with Daddan Yadav's daughter.

1828
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:31,560
How long will you
fix other weddings?

1829
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,600
And let lovers escape?

1830
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:41,240
Do you have something to say?

1831
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,840
Because I'm not going to listen.

1832
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,880
Fix the wedding for 25th May.

1833
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:02,800
You scared me.

1834
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,640
Meena...start preparing
for Abhay's wedding.

1835
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,640
"The heart's broken..."

1836
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:29,720
"Everything seems unreal..."

1837
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:38,520
"What have you done to me?"

1838
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,800
"The world seems aloof."

1839
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:45,160
"There is no God."

1840
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:51,200
"What have you done to me?"

1841
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:56,400
"My eyes are so teary that
even my dreams are slipping."

1842
01:52:56,640 --> 01:53:02,560
"Whom do I tell what love is..."

1843
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:08,680
"I wander around to get
a glimpse of my beloved"

1844
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,440
"and tell her what love is."

1845
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,800
Congratulations.

1846
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,760
You are going to have a
boy and he will make you proud.

1847
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,240
Here you go.
- Wait, Babu.

1848
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,200
You won't take this
money if I have a girl?

1849
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,360
Babu. Give him 500.

1850
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,800
Here you go.

1851
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,720
Here you go.

1852
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,480
And say that I
will have a daughter.

1853
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,160
You will have a daughter.

1854
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,960
Play...

1855
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:41,280
"Someone convince me"

1856
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,360
"and explain me..."

1857
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:50,120
"why I never get what's mine."

1858
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:56,440
"Even if I rebel or
devote myself..."

1859
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:02,320
"no matter what I do,
you never listen."

1860
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:05,520
"My benefactor taunts
and teases me..."

1861
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:08,600
"your love shows no mercy."

1862
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:15,000
"Even though your love's true,
you ended up alone."

1863
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:19,480
"Even my broken
heart skips a beat..."

1864
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:23,400
"...wants to fly away."

1865
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:25,960
- "What is love..."
- Don't be a miser.

1866
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:28,640
That's it.

1867
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,000
It's delicious.

1868
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,160
Ghanti.

1869
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:38,960
You see Babli, brother has sent a message
that he cannot come to your wedding.

1870
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:42,320
I see...

1871
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:44,800
What happened?

1872
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:49,040
He proudly said that
he will come to the wedding.

1873
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:50,760
True.

1874
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:53,800
But one can't leave his wedding.

1875
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:58,080
I mean...it's on the same day.

1876
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,360
25th May.

1877
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,920
He also sent a card for you.

1878
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,640
"My heart's broken, beloved..."
"My heart's broken, beloved..."

1879
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:11,680
"My heart's broken, beloved..."
"My heart's broken, beloved..."

1880
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,680
"My heart's broken, beloved..."
"My heart's broken, beloved..."

1881
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,840
"My heart's broken, beloved..."
"My heart's broken, beloved..."

1882
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:26,080
"My heart's broken, beloved..."
"Some...pretty words..."

1883
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:35,000
"...tried to convince me."

1884
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:42,640
"But I said...you're unaware..."

1885
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:51,080
"...only the one suffering,
knows the pain."

1886
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:56,520
"My eyes are so teary that
even my dreams are slipping."

1887
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:02,360
"Whom do I tell what love is..."

1888
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,840
Bro, I've taken care of everything.

1889
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:06,880
The entire band will be on time.

1890
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,280
No need for money.

1891
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:12,360
We practically own them.

1892
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,320
They played for us
at so many weddings.

1893
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:14,760
Won't they play at
your wedding for free?

1894
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,560
"The heart's broken..."

1895
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:21,040
"Everything seems unreal..."

1896
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,920
"What have you done to me?"

1897
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:36,000
Babli, did you call me?

1898
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:38,320
Yes.

1899
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,840
I want to tell you something.

1900
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,280
Go ahead.

1901
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:43,800
I...

1902
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,640
Abhay and I have done everything
together except for marriage.

1903
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,320
I didn't want to
keep anything from you.

1904
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:00,240
There is still time.
Think about it.

1905
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,960
Do you think of me as an option?

1906
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,640
If you can't get science,
you'll take arts instead.

1907
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,440
I am prepared to be
your fall guy too, Babli.

1908
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,840
And you know that.

1909
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:14,960
So you have to decide...

1910
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:18,480
Why can't you marry the guy

1911
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:23,040
you've already
done everything with?

1912
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,440
No. I have decided.

1913
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:32,560
I want to marry you.
You are the right guy for me.

1914
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,480
This reminds me of a few lines,
and I can't keep it to myself.

1915
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:40,400
"What do I call the helplessness
of love, my friend?"

1916
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:44,120
"Because the one in my arms
is not the one in my dreams."

1917
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,480
I am necessity, Babli...

1918
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,200
...but you need someone else.

1919
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:18,920
Play a wedding song.

1920
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,360
Brother...

1921
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,600
Too much alcohol
is not good for anyone.

1922
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,600
Hazardous for health.

1923
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:38,720
Return the bottle.

1924
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,800
I can't say injurious
so I said hazardous...

1925
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:41,840
Sit back down.

1926
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:45,000
Can you tell me what's
going on in your mind?

1927
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:48,720
You tell me, brother.

1928
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,520
This Ghanti can even
give his life for you.

1929
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:52,560
Balls...

1930
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,800
Ghanti.

1931
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,720
Tell me...
Tell me what to do.

1932
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,120
Can you call off this wedding?

1933
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,240
What did you say?

1934
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,680
I didn't hear you.

1935
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:06,920
Not your cup of tea.

1936
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:08,200
Fine.

1937
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,400
And you heard that.

1938
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:16,120
Stay glued to that
glass...and don't come out.

1939
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:20,000
I had a lot on my mind...but
who should I do it for?

1940
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,120
She is the right one for you.

1941
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:32,840
Abhay, I'll check
the fuel in your car.

1942
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,680
No, she is the best.

1943
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:45,320
But she gave me her wedding card.

1944
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,160
What are you doing, son?

1945
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,440
Following father's orders.

1946
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,880
Then don't.

1947
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,080
Don't listen to him this time.

1948
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,880
You are scared that

1949
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:04,200
you might not be able to take care
of the girl that you love so much.

1950
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:09,040
Will you be able to take care of
the one your father wants you to marry?

1951
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,000
You love Babli, don't you?

1952
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:14,320
Or was it a charade?

1953
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:17,400
I love her, mom,
but she is getting married today...

1954
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:20,680
She did say...

1955
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,760
But what did you do, Abhay Singh?

1956
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,480
It's not too late.

1957
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,320
Listen to your heart.

1958
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:33,920
Or else your life will
turn out to be like mine.

1959
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:39,320
Don't be so scared of someone
that you stop respecting yourself.

1960
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:43,280
You see, son...some relationships

1961
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,680
erase the fine line
between respect and fear.

1962
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:02,400
What was the need
for this grand event?

1963
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,480
We could've had a simple
wedding at a temple.

1964
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,440
Why?

1965
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:07,880
Look at all the guests.

1966
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:09,560
They are feeling uncomfortable.

1967
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:11,280
Get used to it.

1968
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,240
Uncle is really pleased
with me these days.

1969
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:15,320
He's the Development Minister.

1970
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,520
What about that?

1971
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:29,280
I've arranged for everything.

1972
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:15,680
Are you seeing what I am seeing?

1973
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:17,280
Yes.

1974
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,400
Why did you come here?

1975
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,520
I promised you that I
will show up at your wedding.

1976
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:39,400
Even I was getting married today.

1977
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:41,240
But I thought this
was much more important.

1978
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,520
What are you doing here
instead of your wedding?

1979
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:44,840
Counting the plates.

1980
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,600
I've come to marry Babli.

1981
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:54,120
And if anyone interferes,
it will be his last.

1982
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:55,720
Don't make a scene.

1983
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,440
You've broken your
promise so many times...

1984
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:58,880
But not today...

1985
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:00,960
Not today.

1986
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,560
Because I let my heart
decide and heart follow.

1987
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:07,200
Every time it was
my father's attitude...

1988
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:11,880
...but today,
it's my mother's love.

1989
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,640
Every time I tried to snatch you...

1990
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:18,840
...but today I am going to ask.

1991
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,280
Babli.

1992
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,880
He's the right guy for you.

1993
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,640
Say yes...

1994
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:36,160
He was confused,
you were on an ego trip.

1995
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,840
There was no love in the
first place, except for me.

1996
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:41,680
Say yes...

1997
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,520
Abhay Singh!

1998
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,720
I knew it...

1999
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:59,200
Your focus has shifted
from your goal to Love.

2000
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:02,720
You just ruined a lifetime
of honour and pride.

2001
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:06,840
You tried to be the
wise guy after all.

2002
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:11,240
Guddu, kill that lass...

2003
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,880
The name is Babli.

2004
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,760
And she is your future
daughter-in-law.

2005
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:17,760
What?

2006
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:19,480
Daughter-in-law?

2007
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:22,560
You're thinking about her, and
I am thinking about the elections.

2008
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:28,440
I would've forgiven a mistake,
but what you did is a crime.

2009
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,440
Guddu, didn't you hear me?

2010
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,640
Yes, Guddu. Shoot.

2011
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:37,800
And shoot me first.

2012
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:42,080
Because as long as I am alive,
no one can lay a finger on her...

2013
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:43,520
...or my name isn't Abhay Singh.

2014
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,720
Don't forget that
I gave you that name too.

2015
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,560
And I've been paying for that.

2016
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:51,000
What do you think?

2017
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:53,160
Relationships can be enforced.

2018
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:56,840
All these years my mother's
been living in the hope

2019
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,880
that you will change someday.

2020
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:02,440
But you never changed...

2021
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,680
...and I turned into you.

2022
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:11,680
You never understood love
and emotion, but I do now.

2023
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:15,400
I know...what you
taught me was wrong.

2024
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,120
Forced wedding instead of dowry.

2025
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:24,800
Dowry is a big sin and
so are forced marriages.

2026
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:30,800
because all the forced weddings
that we performed are not happy.

2027
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,720
Matches are made in heaven.

2028
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:38,560
When will you understand?

2029
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,080
Guddu, make him understand.

2030
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,640
Shoot, Guddu.

2031
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:47,000
He will get more votes if
his son dies before the elections.

2032
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:48,800
Shoot.

2033
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,200
If you can't shoot him,
then give me the gun.

2034
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:57,760
Here you go.

2035
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:01,640
Now shoot if you can.

2036
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:06,560
Shoot.

2037
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:14,960
Abhay Singh!

2038
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:37,200
See...this time I didn't turn back.

2039
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:42,800
For the second time,
my sister's waiting to get married.

2040
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:45,240
And you guys are making a scene.

2041
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:48,920
Hukum, I am taking
your son with me.

2042
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,640
And I will show you
what is a forced marriage.

2043
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,840
Go, get him!
- Say something, uncle.

2044
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:04,320
I gave Daddan my word.

2045
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:42,520
Stop them, uncle!
Do you want him dead!

2046
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,840
Stop them, uncle!

2047
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,000
He is killing Abhay, uncle!

2048
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,360
We won't spare him!

2049
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:08,880
"No one knows except
for my heart..."

2050
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:13,240
"what is this bond."

2051
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:16,360
"Once formed..."

2052
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:18,840
"It cannot be broken..."

2053
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:22,800
"Such are bonds of love."

2054
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:28,080
"No one knows except
for my heart"

2055
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:33,040
"sooner or later we
will be together forever."

2056
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:37,880
"No one knows except
for my heart"

2057
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:42,880
"sooner or later we
will be together forever."

2058
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:48,120
"People are crazy
for they taunt me."

2059
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,080
"People are crazy
for they taunt me."

2060
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:02,080
"This heart only recognizes
someone like itself."

2061
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:04,160
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes..."

2062
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:08,760
No promise is greater than your child,
Guddu. We are bound to retaliate.

2063
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:11,800
Har Har Mahadev.

2064
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:15,160
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes..."

2065
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:20,120
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

2066
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:24,800
"How do I make you explain..."

2067
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:29,200
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

2068
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:34,520
"Can't stop looking
in your eyes..."

2069
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:39,560
"I wonder what
they are looking for."

2070
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:53,520
"What they are looking for."

2071
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,000
You scounderel!

2072
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,560
Daddan Yadav.

2073
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:02,360
Nothing forced is ever good.

2074
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,400
Neither love nor Marriage.

2075
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,320
I understand now, so should you.

2076
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:12,760
Har Har Mahadev.

2077
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:26,600
You are crying.

2078
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:33,520
The name is Abhay Singh.

2079
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:38,000
I am angry and in love...

2080
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,080
with you.

2081
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,960
Remember I said...

2082
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:47,080
The day you find out,
you will know what to do.

2083
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,800
I love you Mr. Singh.

2084
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:05,760
"In the bars,
they daily raise a toast..."

2085
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:10,240
"In the bars, they daily raise a toast...
They raise a toast in your name."

2086
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:13,000
"Yes! He's Back Again.
From all the way,"

2087
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,160
"Make you crunk again.
And another day,"

2088
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:17,440
"We can spin your brain
into another brain."

2089
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,680
"This is Mastie with
your boy Honey Singh."

2090
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,800
"They treasure you."

2091
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:24,880
"They have also
tattooed your name."

2092
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:30,520
"They treasure you."

2093
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,600
"They have also
tattooed your name."

2094
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:34,880
"They spend a lot for me."

2095
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,040
"They also have my pictures
stuck on the walls."

2096
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:39,280
"They spend a lot for me."

2097
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,920
"They also have my pictures
stuck on the walls."

2098
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,720
"They keep following you."

2099
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,400
"They might kill each
other fighting over you."

2100
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:48,640
"In the bars, they daily raise a toast...
They raise a toast in your name."

2101
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:51,840
"In the bars, they daily raise a toast...
They raise a toast in your name."

2102
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:55,200
"In the bars, they daily raise a
toast... They raise a toast in my name."

2103
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:59,200
"In the bars, they daily raise a
toast... They raise a toast in my name."

2104
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:05,400
"They raise a toast..."

2105
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:07,840
"They all want to claim me."

2106
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,920
"I wonder which one
of them truly loves me."

2107
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,240
"They all want to claim me."

2108
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,800
"I wonder which one
of them truly loves me."

2109
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:19,200
"My heart beats for you...
O beautiful!"

2110
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:22,680
"My heart beats for you,
it yearns only for you."

2111
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:25,920
"In the bars, they daily raise a toast...
They raise a toast in your name."

2112
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,720
"In the bars, they daily raise a toast...
They raise a toast in your name."

2113
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,640
"Yes! He's Back Again. "

2114
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:33,880
"Make you crunk again."

2115
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:35,960
"We can spin your brain."

2116
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,520
"Break it down like this. Boom!"

2117
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,760
"You are mine, I am yours.
Just say yes!"

2118
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:42,960
"What's a heart,
you can even take my life."

2119
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,280
"Just give me a chance."

2120
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,600
"Or find me another
one just like you."

2121
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:52,000
"But that is not possible...
O handsome!"

2122
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:55,720
"It is not possible
to find another one like me."

2123
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:59,080
"In the bars, they daily raise a
toast... They raise a toast in my name."

2124
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:02,520
"In the bars, they daily raise a
toast... They raise a toast in my name."

2125
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:05,600
"In the bars, they daily raise a toast...
They raise a toast in your name."

2126
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:09,280
"In the bars, they daily raise a toast...
They raise a toast in your name."

2127
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:10,960
"They raise a toast..."

2128
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:13,080
"They raise a toast..."

2129
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:15,560
"They raise a toast..."
